Texto completo: A disputed program that allowed the National Security Agency to gain access to logs of Americans' domestic calls and texts yielded only one significant investigation, according to a newly declassified study.
WASHINGTON -- A National Security Agency system that analyzed logs of Americans' domestic phone calls and text messages cost $ 100 million from 2015 to 2019, but yielded only a single significant investigation, according to a newly declassified study.
Moreover, only twice during that four-year period did the program generate unique information that the F.B.I. did not already possess, said the study, which was produced by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and briefed to Congress on Tuesday.
"Based on one report, F.B.I. vetted an individual, but, after vetting, determined that no further action was warranted," the report said. "The second report provided unique information about a telephone number, previously known to U.S. authorities, which led to the opening of a foreign intelligence investigation."
The report did not reveal the subject matter of the one significant F.B.I. investigation that was spurred by the Freedom Act program, and it did not divulge its outcome.
But the high expense and low utility of the call records collected sheds new light on the National Security Agency's decision in 2019 to shutter the program amid recurring technical headaches, halting a counterterrorism effort that has touched off disputes about privacy and the rule of law since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
The information surfaced as Congress was weighing whether to allow the law that authorizes the agency to operate the system -- the USA Freedom Act of 2015 -- to expire on March 15, or whether to accede to the Trump administration's request that lawmakers extend the statute, so the agency could choose to turn the system back on in the future.
The House Judiciary Committee will meet on Wednesday to consider a draft bill that would adjust surveillance law in several ways, including terminating the program's authority. Separately on Tuesday, Attorney General William P. Barr met with Republican senators to urge them to extend three other investigative powers also set to expire on March 15.
The privacy board is an independent agency created by Congress on the recommendation of the commission that studied the Sept. 11 attacks. A declassified, partly censored version of the board's 103-page report was obtained by The New York Times.
In an interview, the board's chairman, Adam I. Klein, praised the National Security Agency for deciding last year to suspend the program -- not only because of its high cost and low value, but because of continuing problems in which telecommunications companies kept sending the agency more people's phone records than it had legal authority to collect.
"It shows a lot of judgment to acknowledge that something that consumed a lot of resources and time did not yield the value anticipated," Mr. Klein said. "We want agencies to be able to reflect on their collection capabilities and wind them down where appropriate. That's the best way to ensure civil liberties and privacy are balanced with operational needs."
In a statement appended to the report, Mr. Klein also noted that phone records were becoming less important as people shifted to using encrypted chat apps. And, he noted, the government could still gain access to some phone logs through other means, like traditional subpoenas for records of discrete accounts, or N.S.A. collection abroad, where there are fewer legal limits.
The Times reported last year that the National Security Agency had delivered a bleak internal assessment of the call records program's steep costs and minimal benefits without taking an explicit position on whether the Trump administration should seek to extend the law that authorized it. But the specific figures undergirding that briefing were previously classified.
The privacy board, working with the intelligence community, got several additional salient facts declassified as part of the rollout of its report. Among them, it officially disclosed that the system has gained access to Americans' cellphone records, not just logs of landline phone calls.
It also disclosed that in the four years the Freedom Act system was operational, the National Security Agency produced 15 intelligence reports derived from it. The other 13, however, contained information the F.B.I. had already collected through other means, like ordinary subpoenas to telephone companies.
The report cited two investigations in which the National Security Agency produced reports derived from the program: its analysis of the Pulse nightclub mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., in June 2016 and of a February 2016 incident in Ohio where a man attacked people at a restaurant with a machete. But it did not say whether the investigations into either of those attacks were connected to the two intelligence reports that provided unique information not already in the possession of the F.B.I.
The system traces back to a secret decision by President George W. Bush to unleash the National Security Agency from certain legal constraints after the Sept. 11 attacks. Among other things, the agency began collecting customer calling records in bulk from several large telecoms. Counterterrorism analysts used the data as a map of social links, hunting for hidden associates of known terrorism suspects by looking at indirect connections.
In 2006, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court secretly blessed the program under a legally disputed interpretation of the Patriot Act. In 2013, the program's existence was leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, prompting an uproar over privacy rights and the rule of law.
Defenders of the program claimed that it could have stopped the Sept. 11 attacks. But in practice, its most concrete accomplishment, according to a 2014 report by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, was leading the F.B.I. to scrutinize a San Diego man who turned out to have donated several thousand dollars to the Shabab, the Islamist group in Somalia. There was no accusation that he was planning to a terrorist attack.
In 2015, Congress enacted the USA Freedom Act, which ended the bulk collection of phone records under the Patriot Act, but authorized the National Security Agency to operate an alternative system that kept the bulk records in the hands of phone companies.
With a judge's permission, the agency could query the system to swiftly obtain the records not only of a suspect, but of everyone with whom that suspect had been in contact.
The exponential math meant that the agency was still gathering a huge number of call and text records about Americans, however. In 2018, the agency obtained 14 court orders, but gathered 434 million call detail records involving 19 million phone numbers.
There were repeated signs of trouble. In spring 2018, the National Security Agency purged hundreds of millions of records after it realized that its database was contaminated with some files the agency had no authority to receive. And in fall 2018, it discovered again that it was overcollecting data. The agency turned off the program in 2019.
The agency has said that the cause of the problems was largely that telecoms were returning erroneous call records. The unclassified version of the privacy board's report adds a few details to that discussion, but sections about exactly what went wrong remain blacked out.
Mr. Klein said that after the agency's staff worked with the intelligence community to get large amounts of information declassified, the board met with Joseph Maguire, the former acting director of national intelligence, to ask for four more things to be made public.
Mr. Maguire agreed to declassify one -- that the program had cost taxpayers $ 100 million -- but three others remain secret despite the board's request. Among them, Mr. Klein said, were additional details about what kinds of records the program did and did not collect, about the cause of the compliance problems with the telecoms and about how the agency processed the data.

Texto completo: The opera superstar was discussing an agreement to pay the performers' union to limit statements about its sexual misconduct investigation, but the arrangement fell apart after details were leaked.
As the union representing opera performers prepared to release the results of an inquiry finding that the superstar Plácido Domingo had engaged in "inappropriate activity" with women, it was quietly working to reach a financial agreement with him.
But the deal they were working on -- which called for the union, the American Guild of Musical Artists, to limit its public statements about the inquiry and for Mr. Domingo to pay the union $ 500,000 -- fell apart on Tuesday after details of the investigation were leaked overnight, according to an email from the union's leaders.
"Based on this flagrant breach of confidentiality Domingo's counsel has withdrawn the agreement, which was expressly premised on A.G.M.A.'s promise to maintain confidentiality over the details of the investigatory report," said the email, which was signed by Leonard Egert, the union's national executive director, and Raymond Menard, its president, and sent to the union's board. It was read to The New York Times by two recipients.
The union released a statement Tuesday night calling the payment a "fine" which it described as "to our knowledge the largest to be imposed on a union member," and not in "exchange for A.G.M.A.'s silence or to make any 'secret deal."'
"Regardless of the fine imposed, A.G.M.A. was never planning to publicly release the specific details of its internal investigation, as the union had assured witnesses of confidentiality," said the statement, which the union said it was releasing to counter "misperceptions" left by reports of the deal by The Times and NPR. "Any suggestion that the union was being paid to withhold information is patently false."
The inquiry began last year after The Associated Press reported allegations of sexual misconduct from women who had worked with Mr. Domingo. In a public statement on Tuesday, the union released the inquiry's conclusions, saying that Mr. Domingo had "engaged in inappropriate activity, ranging from flirtation to sexual advances, in and outside of the workplace."
"Many of the witnesses expressed fear of retaliation in the industry as their reason for not coming forward sooner," the statement said, without providing further detail.
But The A.P. learned that the investigators had spoken with 27 women who described various behaviors including unsolicited kisses on the mouth, groping, and late-night phone calls. Two of the women told investigators they had sex with Mr. Domingo after feeling pressure to submit, The A.P. reported.
The email from Mr. Egert, who declined to comment, criticized whoever divulged the specifics of the investigation, saying that they had broken an internal agreement to keep the details confidential. Earlier, union officials had told members that some of the women who had spoken with investigators had insisted on confidentiality, fearing reprisals from the industry. (The A.P. did not publish any names of women who had not already gone public.)
"As a result of their actions, A.G.M.A. has lost $ 500,000 that not only would have covered the costs of the investigation," the email said, "but also would have funded an extensive sexual harassment prevention training program that is so desperately needed in our industry."
Nancy Seltzer, a spokeswoman for Mr. Domingo, disputed that account, and said that "what is truthful is we are in ongoing discussions with the union on how to move forward and nothing is off the table."
Publicly, Mr. Domingo, 79, a famed tenor who held leadership positions at the Los Angeles Opera and the Washington National Opera, issued his fullest apology yet. "I have taken time over the last several months to reflect on the allegations that various colleagues of mine have made against me," Mr. Domingo said in a statement on Tuesday. "I respect that these women finally felt comfortable enough to speak out, and I want them to know that I am truly sorry for the hurt that I caused them."
Two of the women who went on the record to The A.P. to accuse Mr. Domingo of misconduct and harassment, Patricia Wulf and Angela Turner Wilson, said in a statement through their lawyer that they believed he should be expelled from the union.
Debra Katz, the lawyer representing them, said in an interview that she was "distressed" to learn about the union's financial talks with Mr. Domingo.
"The fact is that A.G.M.A. was trying to enter into a secret deal with Plácido Domingo that was conditioned on confidentiality, and in exchange he gave a tepid apology and offered to pay some money that is a fraction of what he earns," she said. "And what are the women getting out of this?"
Several American companies, including the Metropolitan Opera and the San Francisco Opera, canceled Mr. Domingo's upcoming appearances following the allegations. But European companies said they would await the outcome of investigations into his behavior before deciding whether to act.
Mr. Domingo has numerous upcoming performances planned throughout Europe, where he has been greeted with ovations since the allegations were made public, and several companies said on Tuesday that they expect his appearances to move forward as scheduled.
Next month, Mr. Domingo is scheduled to sing the title role in Verdi's "Simon Boccanegra" at the Hamburg State Opera. A spokesman for the company, Michael Bellgardt, said in an email on Tuesday that he expected Mr. Domingo to perform as planned "if nothing happens to call this into question."
He is still expected to appear as Giorgio Germont in Verdi's "La Traviata" in May at the Teatro Real in Madrid, said Graça Prata Ramos, a spokeswoman for the company. And the Royal Opera House in London said that it planned to go ahead with his appearances there this summer. "Plácido will be here in the summer performing as planned in 'Don Carlo,' " Vicky Kington, a spokeswoman, said in an email Tuesday.
But there was a shift at the Salzburg Festival in Austria, which was the site of Mr. Domingo's first return to the stage after the allegations against him were made public last summer. He is scheduled to return there in August to sing in Verdi's "I Vespri Siciliani." But the festival said it would seek further information before deciding on a course of action.
"The festival's priority was and remains to treat the singer, who has been confronted with accusations of wrongdoing, fairly -- in other words, not to rush to any judgment," it said in a statement. "The facts, however, have now changed."
Citing Mr. Domingo's apology, which, it noted, conceded "that his behavior might have hurt the women in question," the festival said it would seek more information about the investigations in the United States.
Mr. Domingo said in his statement that he took responsibility for his actions.
"I accept full responsibility for my actions, and I have grown from this experience," he continued. "I understand now that some women may have feared expressing themselves honestly because of a concern that their careers would be adversely affected if they did so. While that was never my intention, no one should ever be made to feel that way."
Mr. Menard, the union's president, said in a statement that the union would "remain committed to confronting systemic problems which can cause our members to suffer unlawful discrimination and harassment at work, and to protecting the health and safety of our members."
The Los Angeles Opera, which Mr. Domingo helped found, and led until he stepped down last year, is still conducting its own investigation.

Texto completo: But for a time, tennis fans speculated that her talent might one day eclipse that of her sister Chris, who went on to a Hall of Fame career.
Jeanne Evert Dubin, a former world-ranked professional tennis player and a younger sister of the 18-time Grand Slam champion Chris Evert, died on Thursday. She was 62.
The cause was ovarian cancer, according to an obituary posted online by Lorne & Sons Funeral Home in Delray Beach, Fla., which is handling her funeral arrangements.
One of five tennis-playing children raised by the teaching pro Jimmy Evert and his wife, Colette Evert, Jeanne had a standout junior career in which she became the nation's top-ranked player in her age group. She turned pro in 1973 at age 15, after beating the established stars Rosie Casals and the top-ranked Margaret Court.
She was the youngest player that year to represent her country in the Wightman Cup, an annual competition between British and American players that was discontinued in 1989. And she didn't lose a match in helping a United States team reach the Fed Cup final in 1974.
Early in Evert Dubin's career, tennis fans speculated that her talent could eclipse that of her sister Chris, but it was not to be. Sportswriters began referring to her as the "other Evert."
"I guess people expect me to be something I'm not," Evert Dubin was quoted as saying in The New York Times in 1976. "They feel I let them down. They said I was going to be a great tennis player. At least No. 2."
Evert Dubin reached a career-high 28th in the world in 1978, the year she retired from competition after meeting her husband-to-be, Brahm Dubin, at a tournament in Montreal. Her greatest success on the court came when she teamed with her sister in doubles for two years; they were ranked as high as No. 4 in the United States.
Chris Evert was one of the most dominant tennis players in the history of the sport, ranked No. 1 or No. 2 in the world among female players from 1975 to 1986 in a Hall of Fame career.
"Jeanne was selfless, caring and kind," Chris Evert was quoted as saying in the funeral home's obituary. "As a sister, I admired her stellar character and her unwavering devotion to her loved ones."
Jeanne Evert Dubin was born on Oct. 5, 1957, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She attended St. Thomas Aquinas High School there before leaving to become a professional tennis player.
Evert married Dubin in 1979; he died in 2006. They lived in Delray Beach, where she coached for many years at the Delray Beach Tennis Center.
If Evert Dubin paled in comparison professionally to Chris Evert, she did not hold it against her sister.
"Sure, there's pressure being Chris's sister," she told The Times. "But the good overshadows it. I'd hate to blame my failure on Chris. Whatever I am, I did it to myself."
In addition to her sister Chris, she is survived by another sister, Clare Evert-Shane; two brothers, Drew and John; her mother; her partner, Tower Krauss; a son, Eric; a daughter, Catie Dubin; and four grandchildren.

Texto completo: The death of Hosni Mubarak underscored how Egyptian hopes for democracy following his ouster in 2011 have been crushed under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
CAIRO -- In his final years, Hosni Mubarak basked in the affection of his family and his supporters.
The former autocrat, who ruled Egypt for three decades, was photographed at a Mediterranean beach resort with a smiling granddaughter on his knee. His sons, once viewed as pariahs by many Egyptians, appeared at nightclubs and soccer matches.
Last month, as Mr. Mubarak neared death, his grandson Omar posted a photograph to Instagram that showed him kissing the forehead of his grandfather. "All love and appreciation," it read, with a heart emoji.
Mr. Mubarak's comforting end was a sharp contrast with the final days of his successor as president of Egypt, Mohammed Morsi. Although democratically elected in 2012, Mr. Morsi was ousted a year later, cast into a maximum-security prison where he was denied essential medicines and regular family visits. He died last June after collapsing inside a cage in a courtroom.
The clashing fates of the two men underscore the complex task facing Egyptians as they weigh the legacy of Mr. Mubarak, who divides them in death as in life. Mr. Mubarak, who died on Tuesday at 91, will be buried with full military honors at a state funeral in Cairo on Wednesday.
The soaring hopes for democracy and reform that were stirred by Mr. Mubarak's ouster during the Arab Spring in 2011 have been so completely crushed under its current ruler, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, that some Egyptians find themselves pining for the rule of the man they once despised.
"He was a crook," one Egyptian said on Twitter after the government confirmed Mr. Mubarak's death. "But he was a real man, and he never humiliated Egypt, unlike the dark days we are living now."
That grudging respect for Mr. Mubarak makes commemorating his death a potentially delicate matter for Mr. el-Sisi, who announced three days of national mourning on Tuesday.
Early signals indicated that the government wanted to celebrate Mr. Mubarak as a war hero, principally for his role in leading Egypt's air force against Israel in 1973. But it also wants to avoid any large-scale displays of public sympathy.
That ambivalence was evident in the hours after Mr. Mubarak's death, when state television broadcast a sharply critical obituary, which referred to the last 10 years of Mr. Mubarak's rule as "the decade of lost opportunities," before switching to a promotion for an entertainment talk show.
At the same time, Mr. el-Sisi issued a statement expressing "great sadness and deep sorrow" at the death of Mr. Mubarak. "He was one of the October War commanders and heroes as he served as commander of the Egyptian Air Force during the war, which restored the dignity and pride of the Arab nation," it said.
Reactions among other Egyptians varied greatly. Some were indignant that he was allowed to retire peacefully. "He should have been in a jail cell," said Mohamed El Dahshan, an economist, on Twitter. "Or in The Hague. Instead, he benefited from the broken justice system he left us."
Others gave a weary shrug.
"After nine years we no longer care," said Taker Soliman, whose brother was one of about 800 people killed by Egyptian security forces in the uprising against Mr. Mubarak in 2011. "The revolution achieved nothing. Its demands are upside down, and 90 percent of Egyptians have forgotten about it. They can give Mubarak whatever kind of funeral they want."
A court sentenced Mr. Mubarak to life imprisonment in 2012 for his role in the deaths of protesters during the Arab Spring, but he was acquitted at a retrial. Corruption cases against other senior figures from his administration, as well as his sons, Alaa and Gamal, also collapsed.
His retirement started in earnest in 2017 when he was released from detention at a military hospital in Cairo, and returned to his villa in the upscale Cairo neighborhood of Heliopolis. By then, many of the young protesters who had helped oust Mr. Mubarak in 2011 had been imprisoned or forced into exile by Mr. el-Sisi.
Last fall, Mr. Mubarak spoke in a video posted on YouTube about the 1973 war, his first interview on camera since his ouster. Last May, he spoke with a Kuwaiti journalist about his foreign policy while president, including his efforts to prevent the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1991.
What really caught the attention of Egyptians, though, was a photo of the interview that showed Mr. Mubarak in a suit, sitting in a lavishly decorated room, holding forth as he had for so many years in power. The photograph, posted to Twitter, was signed with Mr. Mubarak's autograph.
His death was mourned by the leaders of Israel and Palestine, whose conflict was a major preoccupation during his decades in power.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel remembered him as "a personal friend," while the Palestinian leader, President Mahmoud Abbas, said Mr. Mubarak "spent his life serving his homeland and the issues of righteousness and justice in the world, with the issue of our Palestinian people at the top of them."
For Mr. el-Sisi, Mr. Mubarak represents a complex figure -- the leader whom Egyptians ousted in a popular uprising, yet, like him, a military-backed authoritarian.
Ultimately, Mr. Mubarak's legacy may be Mr. el-Sisi's iron-fisted rule, said Andrew Miller of the Project On Middle East Democracy.
"Mubarak is gone, but 100 million Egyptians still live in his Egypt," Mr. Miller said. "Sisi is worse than Mubarak in many ways, but without Mubarak there is no Sisi. That is Mubarak's legacy."
Mr. Mubarak's good fortune was most starkly highlighted in December 2018 when he and his sons gave evidence against Mr. Morsi in court. Mr. Mubarak and his sons arrived at the hearing in suits, while Mr. Morsi, who was elected president during Egypt's only free presidential election in 2013, wore prison garb.
After Mr. Morsi died last year, television news anchors read a 42-word obituary that had been circulated by Mr. el-Sisi's intelligence services. It failed to describe him as a former president.
Those from inside Egypt's powerful military who tried to oppose Mr. el-Sisi also met with harsh treatment. Ahmed Shafiq, a former prime minister and retired officer, and Sami Anan, a former army chief, were both silenced when they tried to stand against Mr. el-Sisi in the last presidential election in 2018.
"This is a clear message: Our men don't get humiliated as long as they are within the fold," said Emad Shahin, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo who currently lives in exile.
Among Mr. Mubarak's supporters, his death was a deeply emotional milestone. Assem Abol Khair of Sons of Mubarak, a group that supported Mr. Mubarak during his trials, said he broke down in tears when he learned of it. "I can't believe it," he said.
Beyond the hard-liners, though, the nostalgia was shared by many ordinary Egyptians -- a product of the deep divisions within Egyptian society since the 2011 uprising, which have pitted those who desire systemic change against those who fear it, said Mona El-Ghobashy, a scholar on Egyptian politics at New York University.
"They are fundamentally divided, much as Americans were after the Civil War," she said.
Gamal Eid, a leading human rights activist, said that if Mr. Mubarak had faced true justice for his misdeeds, it would have set a powerful example in the Arab world.
"The tyrants of the world have lost one," he said. "His legacy is a curse: entrenched corruption, bad laws and loyalists who are influential until now and known as the deep state."
Above all, he added, "I am sad that he died without being held accountable."

Re "Bezos Pledges $ 10 Billion Fund to Address Climate Change" (Business Day, Feb. 18):
If Jeff Bezos, the Amazon chief and the world's richest person, wants to spend money to address climate change, the best investment he could make would be to make sure that Democrats take back both the Senate and the White House.
It's wonderful that he wants to fund research, but in the short term our immediate need is for stronger regulations.
Large companies aren't going to voluntarily reduce their carbon emissions if it means reduced profits. And the Republican Party has made it clear that it wants to weaken environmental regulations, not strengthen them.

Texto completo: In an unexpected move, the federal government halted a project that might have led to a multibillion-dollar barrier to protect the region from flooding.
The Trump administration has unexpectedly halted a project to protect the New York City region from flooding during dangerous storms like Hurricane Sandy -- a decision that came six weeks after President Trump took to Twitter to ridicule the study's most expensive proposal, a giant sea wall that could have cost billions of dollars.
The Army Corps of Engineers' announcement that the project was "indefinitely postponed" surprised some of its own officials, and local politicians and advocates said the decision was stunning at a time when climate change is threatening New York's future with intensifying storms.
In a statement, the Corps' New York office said only that the study was suspended because it did not receive funding in the agency's work plan for 2020. Officials there refused to comment on whether they believed that Mr. Trump had influenced the decision. But a senior administration official said the project was shelved because it was too expensive and unfocused.
While Mr. Trump cannot single-handedly cancel a Corps project -- the funding is allocated by Congress, and its work plan is determined jointly by Corps officials, the Department of Defense and the White House Office of Management and Budget -- the unusual suspension of an ongoing project quickly led to speculation that politics had played a role.
Mr. Trump's tweet, in January, criticized one of the five possible proposals to reduce storm flooding along New York Harbor and its rivers: a sea barrier with retractable gates that would stretch from New Jersey to Queens.
The president had called that option "foolish" a day after The New York Times published an article about the proposals. He overstated the barrier's cost at $ 200 billion -- it was estimated at $ 119 billion, and later revised to $ 62 billion -- and advised New Yorkers to get "mops and buckets ready."
A senior Trump administration official said that while the administration "remains committed to helping communities address their flood risks," the New York project and three others that were also recently suspended in Baltimore, New Jersey and Rhode Island had "little or no programmatic direction or end in sight" and that the Corps was reviewing their scope.
The official said that Corps engineers should not have been surprised, because "it is required that these studies have a reasonable cost and scope. These particular ones did not."
The Army Corps' headquarters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
"We can only speculate, but I think the tweet gives a clue as to the reason" for the suspension, said Robert Freudenberg, vice president for energy and environment at the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy group. "This is a president who gets good headlines for his base out of acting against 'blue' states, and there's a disturbing pattern of stalling or trying to end projects that are important to the Northeast."
Julia Arredondo, a City Hall spokeswoman, called cancellation "unacceptable" and "dangerous." She urged the decision makers "to reverse course immediately and finish evaluating the options they are considering to protect New York City and the region."
According to the Corps official in charge of the project, Clifford S. Jones III, it is highly unusual for a Corps project to lose funding after more than three years of work at a cost of several million dollars.
"This doesn't happen," Mr. Freudenberg said. "This is an in-progress study."
In recent months, the Trump administration has tangled with officials in New York -- his birthplace and a center of liberal opposition to his policies. It has, for instance, barred New York residents from Trusted Traveler programs, such as Global Entry, because of the state's immigration policies. The administration may also delay congestion pricing, the state's plan to charge drivers a fee to enter the heart of Manhattan.
The sea barrier project had drawn criticism because it addressed flooding only from storm surges, not from sea rise and storm water runoff. Some environmentalists and planning experts had criticized the wall options that the Corps was focusing on, saying the structures would create flooding outside the walls and trap pollutants, harming the recovering ecology of the Hudson River and New York Harbor.
But even critics were dismayed on Tuesday over the suspension of the study and the loss of billions of federal dollars to help the New York area address flooding dangers.
"The federal government's decision to abandon the Army Corps' storm surge study is reckless, and it exposes our region to the ravages of the next superstorm," New York City's comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, said in a statement.
Mr. Stringer -- who wants to create flood walls, dunes, wetlands and levees to protect the city in lieu of a large barrier -- had called for the project to be reframed, not canceled. The Corps study had only included one proposal without sea walls.
Canceling the whole project strips New York and New Jersey of their main chance to get federal aid to address flooding, he said, adding, "There is no other study underway at this scale that could give federal dollars to protect our people, our businesses and our ecosystems."
Mr. Jones, the Corps official, said that his engineers were disappointed and that the New York office was seeking more information about the cancellation.
"When you're working on something, you never like to be caught in a position where you're shut down in the middle before you even finish your mission," he said.

U.S. Faces Thorny Task: Halting Domestic Terrorists as They Outpace Jihadists

Texto completo: Even as the menace from homegrown extremists grows more explicit, law enforcement is wrestling with how to combat it.
When the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness issued its terrorism threat assessment for 2020 last week, it noted a marked shift.
The threat level from violent, homegrown extremists, and specifically white supremacists, was marked in red as the top category: "High." The threat from the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and their ilk was demoted to third, in green: "Low."
Terrorism experts believe that holds true for the entire United States.
"In the U.S., more people are killed by far-right extremists than by those who are adherents to Islamist extremism," said Mary McCord, a Georgetown University law professor and a former senior Justice Department official for national security. Her comments came at a discussion last week at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, which commemorates victims of the most notorious attack by international terrorists on American soil.
Even as the menace from homegrown extremists grows more explicit, however, law enforcement is wrestling with how to combat it. That challenge has spawned a fervent debate over whether the United States needs a new law to specifically criminalize domestic terrorism, or whether such a statute would threaten basic First Amendment rights.
Proponents argue that a domestic terrorism law would streamline and clarify the patchwork of charges now used against homegrown extremists, charges that often avoid even mentioning terrorism.
Opponents counter that a new law would amount to a worrisome expansion of government powers, and might face constitutional challenges on the grounds of impinging on free speech.
Yet the New Jersey report laid out what is at stake in stark terms. "Some white supremacist extremists argue that participating in mass attacks or creating other forms of chaos will accelerate the imminent and necessary collapse of society in order to build a racially pure nation," it said.
After Latino shoppers were targeted in a shooting in El Paso last August, leaving 22 people dead, Congress proposed a new wave of laws. However, most of those have stalled.
But the recent arrests of eight members of a white supremacist group called the Base, some of whose members were accused of planning a mass attack in Richmond, Va., have renewed focus on the issue. Three members arrested in Maryland pleaded not guilty last week to various charges, including transporting a firearm and ammunition with the intent to commit a felony.
Senior law enforcement officials express frustration that cases like those cannot be called terrorism in court.
"The statutes that are typically deployed in connection with domestic terrorism cases are really kind of pedestrian in nature," said Thomas E. Brzozowski, the Justice Department's counsel for domestic terrorism. "This confuses people. It leads to this pervasive but false narrative that somehow the government is paying more attention to the Islamic extremist threat than to the domestic threat."
With both Democrats and Republicans proposing legislation, the issue is one of the few that does not divide strictly along partisan lines.
There is no legal mechanism for designating domestic extremist groups as terrorists. Federal laws define terrorism as a criminal attack intended to intimidate and coerce civilians in order to influence government policy or to otherwise affect government conduct.
They also define 57 specific acts as federal crimes of terrorism. Among the conditions required for formally labeling a crime terrorism in court are targeting an international airport, using a weapon of mass destruction or attacking federal officials.
Such charges come into play periodically. Using a weapon of mass destruction was among the accusations faced by Glendon Scott Crawford, a member of the Ku Klux Klan from upstate New York who failed in his attempt to build a radiation death ray that would inflict cancer on Muslims hit from afar. In 2016, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
However, current terrorism statutes do not incorporate most attacks on civilians that involve guns or vehicles, or the stockpiling of assault weapons, which Ms. McCord, the Georgetown law professor, said was a gaping hole considering their frequency. A new law would also underscore that society considers white supremacist violence on par with jihadism, she said.
Several draft bills seek to define domestic terrorism as a crime and to prescribe court sentences, including the death penalty. A less sweeping bill would force the federal government to make public statistics about all violence attributed to white supremacy.
The F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, told the House Judiciary Committee this month that the agency had more than 1,000 violent extremist investigations in progress, covering all 50 states, but he resisted providing a more detailed breakdown.
He described "racially motivated violent extremism" as a "national threat priority" equal to the threat from the Islamic State. The F.B.I. has also created the Domestic Terrorism-Hate Crimes Fusion Cell to buttress its efforts, he said, stressing that the focus is "not about the ideology, it's about the violence."
Misgivings about a new law are also bipartisan.
African-American and Muslim organizations harbor deep concerns that a new law could actually be used against minority groups -- organizations protesting police violence, for example -- even though their communities are among the most frequently targeted. Current hate crimes laws are powerful enough to prosecute these acts, said Nadia Aziz, the policy counsel for the Stop Hate Project at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
"We need to know how domestic terrorism investigations are being carried out right now instead of a new statute," said Ms. Aziz, echoing a common criticism.
A sweeping new law also makes some conservatives uneasy. The lack of such a law has not hindered the prosecution of anyone who carried out terrorist attacks domestically, said Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who specializes in technology, privacy and civil liberties.
He pointed out that one domestic terrorism law proposed by a Republican congressman specified various prison sentences, including up to 25 years for destroying or damaging "any structure, conveyance or other real property."
That means a protester who engaged in vandalism to make a political point could face 25 years in jail. "Beyond being unnecessary, it seems quite thorny and dangerous," Mr. Sanchez said.
After Mr. Trump's inauguration, more than 200 demonstrators were arrested, some in connection with smashing storefronts and damaging vehicles. All charges were eventually dropped, but under such a law the defendants could be charged with terrorism, Mr. Sanchez noted.
Critics of federal counterterrorism measures, and even some senior law enforcement officials, believe that the intense focus on the jihadist threat since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks slowed efforts to counter white supremacists.
"There is a blind spot within law enforcement about the threat white supremacy poses," said Michael German, a former undercover agent with the F.B.I. who researches national security law at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. "The F.B.I. and other intel agencies were not putting their resources toward the most serious threats."
Under the Trump administration, the F.B.I. began dividing domestic extremism among four categories, down from 11: racially motivated violent extremism; anti-government/anti-authority violent extremism; animal rights/environmental extremism and abortion extremism.
Members of Congress have expressed skepticism about lumping white supremacists with other groups given the recent history of violent attacks directed against Latinos in El Paso, Jews in Pittsburgh and African-Americans in Charleston, S.C., among others.
There is no official source on the number of attacks carried out by white supremacists in the United States. Statistics kept by academic centers or nongovernmental organizations rarely match because of different methods, including various definitions of right-wing extremism.
In addition, the tendency to include them with other hate crimes leaves the extent of the problem unclear.
"The F.B.I. is being evasive," said Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California and a member of the Judiciary Committee. "It raises the question as to whether or not they are seriously looking at white supremacy."
In the short term, a far more likely outcome than a new law is the State Department designating a foreign white supremacist group as a terrorist organization, allowing for law enforcement agencies to pursue any United States adherents for providing material support for terrorism.
The debate over a domestic terrorism law underscores just how complex the terrorist threat has become in the nearly two decades since Sept. 11, said Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.
"You look at the landscape now -- it is scattered," he said, with white supremacists and antigovernment organizations rivaling jihadists in their aspiration to foment mayhem. "It is a diversification of the homegrown threat in a way that we have not seen before."

Texto completo: The relatives of a 28-year-old Texan urged the U.S. government to intervene, in a cases that drew parallels to the imprisonment of Paul N. Whelan on espionage charges.
MOSCOW -- A Russian court on Tuesday ordered a former United States Marine be detained for another six months on accusations he assaulted police officers in Moscow last year, a charge that his defense team has called "fraudulent."
The arrest of the former service member, Trevor Reed, 28, of Texas, has drawn comparisons to the 2018 detention in Russia of another ex-Marine, Paul N. Whelan, on espionage accusations.
That case, along with the detention of Mr. Reed, has been seen by some as intended to create leverage for a potential prisoner exchange. The families of both men have called for the United States government to intervene.
"He is an American citizen who was jailed for something that we don't believe that he did," Mr. Reed's father said in an interview outside the courtroom on Tuesday. "Because we believe that the charges are false, we would like for the U.S. government to look at the case closely."
Mr. Reed's family has not spoken to the news media since his arrest more than six months ago, wary of upsetting the Kremlin by making broad statements about what may be the motives behind his prosecution. But they argue that his being held in a Moscow detention center while awaiting trial is disproportionate to the charges against him.
In a bail hearing on Tuesday, the court declined an offer by Mr. Reed's father to post bail of $ 15,300 and guarantee that the former Marine would remain in Russia throughout the trial. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison. His next hearing is scheduled for March 11.
Mr. Reed, who was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2016, traveled to Moscow last May to learn Russian and spend time with his Russian girlfriend, whom he had met during a vacation in Greece and whom the court identified as Alina Tsibulnik.
On Aug. 15, he attended a party for his girlfriend's colleagues at which he was encouraged to drink a large amount of vodka, according to a statement issued by his family. Mr. Reed has said that he has no memory of what followed.
"There is also a possibility that he may have been given other substances without his knowledge," the statement said.
After the party ended, Mr. Reed became highly agitated, leading his girlfriend and others to call the police so that he wouldn't get hurt, according to the statement.
Officers took him to a police station and instructed his girlfriend to come back for him after two hours, his family said. Upon returning to the station, they said, she found Mr. Reed being interviewed by members of Russia's Federal Security Agency, or F.S.B., the country's most powerful security body.
The statement said the interview took place "without an attorney or adequate interpreter while he was still under the influence."
Mr. Reed was subsequently accused of assault for grabbing the arm of the officer who was driving him to the police station, causing the vehicle to swerve. He was also accused of striking another officer who was sitting in the back seat. That officer suffered minor injuries.
In the case of Mr. Whelan, after his arrest in December 2018, he was held in solitary confinement in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo Prison, a facility long used by the K.G.B. and its successors for Soviet dissidents and foreign spies. He remains in prison.
And last October, a Russian court sentenced Naama Issachar, an American-Israeli woman, to seven and a half years in prison for carrying a few grams of marijuana in her luggage during a layover. Ms. Issachar's family said they had been told that her destiny might depend on the fate of Aleksei Burkov, a Russian hacker who was arrested in Israel and was later extradited to the United States.
After months of high-profile diplomatic brinkmanship by top Israeli officials, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia pardoned Ms. Issachar in January.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Over the past decade, technology startups grew so quickly that they couldn't hire people fast enough.
Now the layoffs have started coming in droves. Last month, robot pizza startup Zume and car-sharing company Getaround slashed more than 500 jobs.
Then DNA testing company 23andMe, logistics startup Flexport, Firefox maker Mozilla and question-and-answer website Quora did their own cuts.
"It feels like a reckoning is here," said Josh Wolfe, a venture capitalist at Lux Capital in New York.
It's a humbling shift for an industry that long saw itself as an engine of job creation and innovation, producing ride-hailing giant Uber, hospitality company Airbnb and other now well-known brands that often disrupted entrenched industries.
Their rise was propelled by a wave of investor money - about $763 billion washed into startups in the United States over the past decade - that also fueled the growth of young companies in delivery, cannabis, real estate and direct-to-consumer goods.
Unlike low-cost software startups, these private companies frequently took on old-line competitors by spending heavily on physical assets and workers while losing money.
Now a pullback is unfolding in precisely the areas that drew the most hype.
Around the world, more than 30 startups have slashed more than 8,000 jobs over the past four months, according to a tally by The New York Times.
Investments in young companies have fallen, with 2,215 startups raising money in the United States in the last three months of 2019, the fewest since late 2016, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook, which track startups.
And those are not the only signs of change.
Casper Sleep, which billed itself as the "Nike of sleep" by selling mattresses online, flopped when it went public this month. Once-hot companies like Lime, the electric scooter provider, have pulled out of some cities. Others, like e-commerce startup Brandless, game app HQ Trivia and electronics maker Essential Products, are on the verge of shutting down.
There are now "frantic mini-moments of panic, as one thing after another happens," said Roy Bahat, an investor at Bloomberg's venture arm in San Francisco. "At some point, one rock after another will fall away from the cliff, and we'll realize we're not standing on anything in many, many companies."
Many startups are sagging after a difficult 2019, when prominent "unicorns" - companies valued at $1 billion or more by private investors - fell flat on Wall Street.
Uber and Lyft, which are losing billions of dollars a year, staged disappointing initial public offerings last spring. And WeWork, the office rental firm, pulled its public offering, ousted its chief executive and cut its valuation by 80% late last year.
The retreats are being led by companies that were backed by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate with a $100 billion Vision Fund for investing in startups. SoftBank bet big on companies like Uber and WeWork, as well as Colombian delivery startup Rappi and Indian hospitality startup Oyo.
All have undergone layoffs in recent months.
The pullback will probably not be as severe as the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, when dozens of unprofitable internet firms failed.

Texto completo: Hank Azaria is opening up about his decision to retire voicing Apu on "The Simpsons. "
The Emmy-winning voice actor, 55, announced last month that he would stop voicing the beloved yet divisive character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, which has been criticized as a racist caricature that promotes negative stereotypes about Indians.
"Once I realized that that was the way this character was thought of, I just didn’t want to participate in it anymore," Azaria told The New York Times in an interview published Tuesday. "It just didn’t feel right. "
The veteran has voiced various characters in the fictional town of Springfield over the last three decades, including Moe Szyslak and Chief Wiggum, but Azaria has become synonymous with Apu, an Indian immigrant who owns the Kwik-E-Mart convenience store and is best known for his catchphrase, "Thank you, come again. "
'The Simpsons': Kwik-E-Mart is now a real place, where you can eat Lard Lad Donuts
Azaria told the Times that he based the character off the 1968 film "The Party" – where Peter Sellers wore brownface to portray an Indian actor – in addition to Pakistani and Indian clerks he heard growing up in New York.
"That represents a real blind spot I had," Azaria said, explaining that he was unaware of the racial insensitivity of Sellers' performance at the time. "There I am, joyfully basing a character on what was already considered quite upsetting. "
'The Simpsons': Hank Azaria is 'perfectly willing and happy' to stop voicing Apu
Although Azaria has stepped down from voicing Apu, the character's future lies solely in the hands of "The Simpsons" executive producers, who have full creative control.
"We respect Hank’s journey in regard to Apu. We have granted his wish to no longer voice the character," the show's executive producers said in a statement to USA TODAY provided by Antonia Coffman. "Apu is beloved worldwide. We love him, too. Stay tuned. "
It's not clear if the character will be written out or recast with an Indian actor.
Azaria, who has won four Emmys for his voice-over work on "The Simpsons," said some good has come from the controversial character: It has sparked a much-needed dialogue about representation in television.
"What happened with this character is a window into an important issue," he said. "It’s a good way to start the conversation. I can be accountable and try to make up for it as best I can. "

Texto completo: .
Senator Bernie Sanders finally got the front-runner treatment on Tuesday night, facing an onslaught of direct attacks from his rivals on his gun record, foreign policy views, and effectiveness as they tried to slow his march to the nomination.
As the candidates gathered in Charleston, S.C., for the Democrats' 10th debate, their newly aggressive focus on Sanders reflected the growing threat he poses to the rest of the field after winning two of the first three early states and leading most national polls heading into South Carolina's primary on Saturday and the Super Tuesday sweepstakes of 14 primaries next week.
More than anything, most of his rivals painted the 78-year-old democratic socialist as a risky nominee who is too radical to defeat President Trump. But theyalso accused him of being too far to the right on some key issues, including gun control. The result was an at-times bruising two hours for Sanders, who was spared intense scrutiny in last week's debate when many candidates trained their sights on former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg instead.
Sanders grew visibly agitated defending himself, and even faced boos from the crowd at times.
But it was as unclear as ever at the end of the night which candidate could coalesce enough support to take on Sanders in a split field, as the stage at times descended into cacophony with each of his rivals jostling to land a blow on the front-runner.
“Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States," Bloomberg told Sanders early in the debate. “And that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him."
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg asked the crowd to “imagine" the chaos and divisiveness of a Trump vs. Sanders race in 2020 and said Sanders would hurt down-ballot Democrats.
It was not apparent whether any single blow was as damaging to Sanders as the onslaught Bloomberg faced at last week's debate — or whether it was too late to blunt the Vermont senator's momentum regardless.
Sanders repeatedly stressed his own electability, rattling off the head-to-head polling that shows him defeating Trump and his own ability to rally a “grass-roots movement" fueled by his proposals for tuition-free college, Medicare for All, and a $15 minimum wage.
“I'm hearing my name mentioned a little tonight," Sanders said at one point, suggesting that his rivals were only after him due to his recent victories. “I wonder why."
But Sanders occasionally seemed unprepared, awkwardly responding to a moderator's request that he “do the math" on his signature policy proposal, Medicare for All.
“How many hours do you have?" Sanders asked.
Buttigieg jumped into the ensuing melee to land a blow on the senator.
“I'll tell you exactly what it adds up to," Buttigieg said. “It adds up to four more years of Donald Trump." Buttigieg added that many Democratic members of Congress are “running away" from Sanders' platform. Sanders countered that his proposal would actually save more money long-term than Buttigieg's by tackling medical expenses.
Former vice president Joe Biden, who is still narrowly leading South Carolina polls, repeatedly slammed Sanders' record on guns, tying his vote against a 1993 background check bill and other gun positions to “carnage" and millions of gun violence deaths after also linking them to the 2015 white supremacist church shooting in Charleston.
“I'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths," Biden conceded. “But that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period I suggested."
Sanders deflected the accusation, drawing the ire of the crowd.
“You know, Joe has voted for terrible trade agreements," Sanders said in his defense, as the crowd booed him. “Joe voted for the war in Iraq. I have cast thousands of votes including bad votes. That was a bad vote."
Sanders faced difficult questions from the moderators as well as his rivals on the issue of his electability. At one point, he was asked to defend his comments praising the Chinese Communist Party and his expressions of “sympathy for socialist governments in Cuba and Nicaragua."
“Authoritarianism of any stripe is bad," Sanders said, growing agitated, “but that is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good."
Buttigieg jumped in to suggest that the very question makes Sanders too dangerous a nominee for the Democrats.
“We're certainly not going to win these critical, critical House and Senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the Democratic Party is telling people to look at the bright side of the Castro regime," Buttigieg said.
Biden shot down Sanders' defense that Barack Obama had also praised some aspects of Fidel Castro's rule, saying the former president “did not in any way suggest there was anything good about the Cuban government."
Senator Elizabeth Warren jumped into the onslaught against Sanders in the opening minutes of the debate and took the rare step of criticizing him directly — not for being too far left, but for being too ineffectual to enact his sweeping agenda. .
“Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie," Warren said, casting herself as a more capable and detail-oriented alternative and saying it was she, not he, who managed to rein in the banks after the 2008 financial crash.
She also attacked his marquee Medical for All plan as being too vague. “I dug in, I did the work, and then Bernie's team trashed me for it," Warren said of her own Medicare for All proposal.
At times, she and Buttigieg — who have been at odds in previous debates — seemed to work together to paint Sanders as ineffective. After Warren said progressives could not enact their agenda without rolling back the filibuster, a Senate rule that means 60 votes are usually needed to advance legislation, Buttigieg distilled the matter to a single question.
“How are you going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change?" Buttigieg asked, playing off of Sanders' “political revolution" catchphrase.
At the end of the debate, Sanders said one of the biggest misconceptions about him is that he's “radical," saying his ideas are common sense, not left-wing. “Everything is impossible until it happens," he said, quoting Nelson Mandela.
But Sanders wasn't the only candidate to absorb blows on Tuesday. Revealing his precarious standing in his firewall of South Carolina, Biden took the time to attack Tom Steyer, the billionaire who is an afterthought in national polls but rising in polls in that state after spending heavily there, for investing in private prisons.
Biden also spent some of his speaking time deriding the moderators for not letting him speak enough.
“I know how you cut me off all the time, but I'm not going to be quiet anymore, OK?" Biden said during an exchange about housing policy, before he went silent.
Bloomberg, who was the lightning rod of the last debate, was spared another licking by the focus on Sanders — but still absorbed bracing blows from Warren this time around.
Warren told a familiar story of losing a teaching job because she was pregnant — and concluded it by leveling a serious charge at Bloomberg.
“At least I didn't have a boss who said to me, 'Kill it,' the way that Bloomberg is alleged to have said to one of his pregnant employees," Warren said, referencing an accusation from one of Bloomberg's former workers.
Bloomberg immediately objected, denying the charge and seeking to dismiss Warren's criticisms as “sideshows." Warren pressed him to release more women in his business from nondisclosure agreements — beyond the three he already did after she eviscerated him on the stage last week — but he demurred.
“The trouble is for this senator, enough is never enough," he said.

Texto completo: Appearing aggrieved, he clamors for recusals by Sotomayor and Ginsburg

President Trump on Tuesday called on two liberal justices of the Supreme Court to recuse themselves from anything 'Trump-related,' escalating an un or tho dox battle with the judiciary from which even his own lawyers have advised retreat.
In tweets and comments at a news conference in India " and just a month before the Supreme Court is to consider congressional and prosecutors' requests for the president's closely guarded financial records " Trump targeted Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Trump interpreted as biased a dissent from Sotomayor about his administration's tendency to seek emergency interventions from the Supreme Court. He reminded Ginsburg of remarks she made about him as a candidate in 2016, for which she has expressed regret. His comments appeared to be based on a Fox News segment rather than a parsing of Sotomayor's seven-page dissent in an immigration case.
The president's broadside breached what normally is an arm's-length distance between the White House and the high court, and it cast the disagreements in starkly personal terms. It follows Trump's recent attacks on Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who oversaw the conviction of his friend Roger Stone, and underscored complaints from Attorney General William P. Barr that the president's tweets and statements were making it 'impossible' for Barr to do his job.
Trump's comments about Sotomayor and Ginsburg also brought complaints from the political left. 'No president in modern time has shown greater disrespect for or worked to actively undermine the independence of the judiciary than President Trump,' said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
Social media weighed in as well: What about Justice Clarence Thomas, whose wife, Ginni Thomas, opines to the White House about personnel decisions? Can Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh be impartial about the man who appointed them?
The controversy is just the kind that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who presided over Trump's Senate impeachment trial, always hopes the court can avoid.
'The point is when you live in a politically polarized environment, people tend to see everything in those terms,' Roberts said last fall.
A court spokeswoman on Tuesday said that Roberts, Sotomayor and Ginsburg had no comment on the president's words.
In his tweet, Trump appeared provoked by a segment that Fox News host Laura Ingraham did Monday night about the dissent Sotomayor issued Friday night.
The court, with its five conservatives in the majority and four liberals dissenting, removed the last remaining obstacle allowing the Trump administration's 'public charge' rule to go into effect. The policy turns away immigrants who are likely to rely on public benefits to support themselves or their families.
Writing only for herself, Sotomayor complained that the federal government has been too quick to ask the Supreme Court for emergency relief from lower-court decisions that had not gone through the usual legal process.
'It is hard to say what is more troubling: that the government would seek this extraordinary relief seemingly as a matter of course, or that the court would grant it,' Sotomayor wrote.
The countervailing view, which two of her conservative colleagues had expressed in an earlier opinion, is that lower-court judges had been too eager to impose nationwide injunctions on administration policies, rather than allowing them to be implemented while challenged in court.
Neither opinion " the one written by Sotomayor or the other by Gorsuch and Thomas " specifically mentioned Trump or the administration.
But the segment by Ingraham was critical of Sotomayor's opinion, and the president mentioned it specifically in his tweet. In the news conference, he seemed less familiar with what Sotomayor actually wrote.

'Her statement was so inappropriate,' Trump said. 'When you're a justice of the Supreme Court " and it's almost what she's trying to do is take the people that do feel a different way and get them to vote the way that she would like them to vote. I just thought it was so inappropriate, such a terrible statement for a Supreme Court justice to . . . '
A reporter asked what was inappropriate about Sotomayor's complaint that the government was running to the Supreme Court too frequently.
'No, I don't think that was it,' Trump responded. 'But I think what she did say is she's trying to shame " the way I look at it, she's trying to shame people with, perhaps, a different view, into voting her way, and that's so inappropriate.'
Ingraham criticized Sotomayor for not speaking out when Ginsburg during the 2016 campaign called Trump a 'faker.' Ingraham said Ginsburg had gotten a 'big pass' on that, even though it received widespread media attention, criticism from newspaper editorial boards and a statement from Ginsburg that she regretted speaking on presidential politics.
Trump picked up on that as well. 'I just don't know how they cannot recuse themselves for anything having to do with Trump or Trump-related. The right thing to do as the " you know, as a Supreme Court justice, there's a different standard.'
Judicial ethics experts disagree with that view, even though it is up to individual justices to decide when to bow out.
Even those who have criticized the court for a lack of transparency on recusal decisions and not having a specific ethics policy said Sotomayor's comments did not qualify.
'The idea being advanced by President Trump " that a justice becomes conflicted if she disagrees with the executive branch's legal strategy or constitutional theory " is not only wrong but also degrading to the independence of our judiciary,' said Gabe Roth of the organization Fix the Court.
Trump's comments about Sotomayor and Ginsburg came amid reports that could also provide uncomfortable moments for the court's public perception. Axios and the New York Times reported that Ginni Thomas regularly sends the White House memos and suggestions about which people to fire " and who should replace them.
Although Trump said it was a 'tough ticket' to be invited to his post-acquittal White House event, Thomas was among his cheering supporters. She is a longtime conservative activist, though current and former White House aides say she has been a less frequent presence at the White House recently and is not particularly influential with the president.
She is part of a gathering of conservative leaders " consisting largely of members of the Conservative Action Project " that Vice President Pence's team hosts in his office about once a month, as part of its outreach to the conservative movement.
Again, judicial ethics experts have said that the political activities of a spouse should not mean automatic recusal for a judge or justice.
Nor does whether the president was involved in a judge or justice's appointment.
In private, Trump is generally effusive about the Supreme Court, aides said. He boasts about how 'great' his two appointments " Gorsuch and Kavanaugh " are, and he delights in the prospect of getting to fill another vacancy, they said.
The president is always excited when cases that have failed at the lower level move to the high court's docket, and he is especially gratified when the court rules in a way that benefits him or his administration, they added.
Gorsuch and Kavanaugh have been part of those majorities consistently.
But once justices are confirmed, they are expected to be independent, and it is rare there would be a conflict with the president that would require them to recuse themselves from a case.
The coming cases on Trump's financial records " which the president went to court to shield from congressional committees and a New York district attorney " will be closely watched.
In the court's most noteworthy cases involving presidential powers, the court said President Richard Nixon had to turn over recordings made in the White House, and that President Bill Clinton had to comply with a civil action. Both decisions were unanimous and joined by each president's appointees.

Texto completo: The founder of the #MeToo movement has said she hopes Harvey Weinstein's accusers experienced catharsis from his rape trial, and slammed remarks made by the disgraced movie mogul's defense team as "vile."
Tarana Burke said she had gotten to know some of Weinstein's accusers over the past several years. Speaking to The Brief's Bianca Nobilo on Thursday, she said: "I know for them it's been really difficult to watch this [trial]... so I watch it thinking, I hope for them that there's some catharsis in this."
Weinstein, 67, was charged with first-degree criminal sexual act, two counts of rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault. The charges were based on testimony from Miriam Haley, a former production assistant, who said that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006, and on testimony from former actress Jessica Mann, who said that he raped her in 2013 during what she described as an abusive relationship.
Burke spoke with CNN days before a jury delivered their verdict in the Weinstein case. The film producer was found guilty of committing a criminal sexual act in the first degree against Haley and rape in the third degree against Mann.
Weinstein's defense attorneys argued that the sexual encounters were consensual. As evidence, they pointed out that both Haley and Mann had sex with Weinstein after the alleged attacks, and they continued to have friendly contact with him for years afterward. Weinstein has also denied allegations of non-consensual sexual activity related to other women who have accused him.
While the trial was ongoing, Donna Rotunno, Weinstein's lead attorney, said she had never experienced sexual assault herself because she "never put [herself] in any vulnerable circumstance."
"I would never put myself in that position," Rotunno told The Daily podcast.
Burke said comments like those from Rotunno amounted to "doubling down on stereotypes" about sexual assault victims.
"I think some of the things that I've heard are vile, to be quite honest," Burke told CNN. "It does a disservice to the work that we do to shift the narrative, the mainstream narrative about what really happens in the life of a survivor."
Burke, 46, founded the #MeToo movement in 2006 and used MySpace as a platform to spread her message.
At the time, social media platforms were nascent and Weinstein was the toast of Hollywood. Burke spent the following decade building her organization and working with survivors of sexual abuse.
In October 2017, the New York Times broke the story about allegations against Weinsten. A New Yorker article, detailing further accusations, was published days later. Weinstein denied the allegations of non-consensual sex. As the entertainment industry reeled, actress Alyssa Milano sent a tweet in line with Burke's message.
"If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet," Milano wrote. The #MeToo hashtag spread across Twitter ina matter of hours, as thousands of women used the phrase to share personal stories of sexual harassment and assault.
"I was not surprised by the number [of women]," Burke said. "I've never been in a room with, you know, 20 people, where at 1 east 10 of them couldn't say me too."'
Michelle Simps-: n Tuegel, a victims rights att: rney, told CNN that the movement had led to a growing number of sexual assault survivors to come forward and seek legal assistance.
"I've definitely seen a change there, with people picking up the phone," she said. "Post-#MeToo, clients are less afraid to come forward and attach their name and identity to a case."
Tuegel said it was "a little bit unfortunate" that the movement's global fame was linked to Hollywood stars. Many of Weinstein's most prominent accusers are white women who work in the entertainment industry such as Rosanna Arquette and Asia Argento.
Burke herself has said that minorities were sidelined from the movement, telling a TIME 100 summit in 2019: "The women of color, trans women, queer people - our stories get pushed aside and our pain is never prioritized."
"Sexual assault is not a white women problem, it is a human problem," Tuegel said.
Burke told CNN that ordinary people across society helped #MeToo achieve international prominence and that their voices should not be ignored.
"We have to tell a different story," she said. "We have to make sure that the narrative of the story is not focused on this really, really narrow part of the story."
The activist also described President Donald Trump's impact on her movement as "not positive."
Trump has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment. He has strongly denied all the allegations. "What kind of example are you [as president] setting for the country," Burke asked.
In the future, the activist is hoping to take her organization beyond the U.S. and Western countries.
"We're excited to expand globally," the activist told CNN, adding that abuse survivors regularly contact her in the wake of #MeToo's viral fame. "We have thousands of survivors who reach out to us on a daily and weekly basis to say 'thank you for doing this."

Texto completo: Julius Montgomery had already broken one color barrier when he faced another.
In 1956, he had become the first African American who was not a janitor to be hired to work at the Cape Canaveral space facility in Florida. He was part of a team of technical professionals, known as "range rats," who repaired the electronics in malfunctioning ballistic missiles and satellite equipment.
Two years later, his team wanted to start a school to keep the space workers up-todate. Brevard Engineering College, as it was to be called (Cape Canaveral is in Brevard County), planned to lease classrooms at a public junior high school near the space center.
But public officials in Florida - a state still in the grip of Jim Crow and the Ku Klux ??? (iad control over who walked into their classrooms. And they didn'twant Black people.
The county's superintendent of schools said he would not allow Montgomery to participate, and he threatened to shut down the college before it even got started.
Montgomery withdrew his application so the college could open. Three years later, in 1961, Brevard secured its own facilities and admitted Montgomery, who became the first student to integrate the college, known today as the Florida Institute of Technology.
The school has long acknowledged that it would not exist were it not for Montgomery's sacrifice. In 2006, it honored him with the first annual Julius Montgomery Pioneer Award for community service.
Montgomery died on Wednesday, Jan. 22,2020 at a nursing home in Melbourne, Florida, just days after Florida Tech awarded him an honorary doctorate of humane letters. He was 90. A daughter, Gaye Montgomery, said the cause was heart failure.
His breaking the color barrier at Cape Canaveral and his sacrifice in helping the college get off the ground were not Montgomery's only pioneering achievements. He was also the first African American to win a seat on the City Council of the new, expanded city of Melbourne, after the old city merged with the adjacent Eau Gallieinl969.
Montgomery had started running for office when he moved to the area in 1956, when few African Americans held public office anywhere in the South. At the time, Florida had one of the country's highest lynching rates per capita, according to Richard Paul, an author, with Steven Moss, of "We Could Not Fail: The First African Americans in the Space Program" (2015). Montgomery is the subject of one of the book's chapters.
It took Montgomery 13 years of campaigning, off and on, to win his seat on the council. And it would be more than 35 years before another African American was elected to that body.
Julius Marvin Montgomery was born May 30,1929, in Homewood, Alabama, the oldest of 12 children of Edward Perkins Montgomery Sr. and Queen Ester (Jackson) Montgomery. Ihe family lived in Rosedale, Homewood's oldest neighborhood, whicn was settled by former slaves after the Civil War.
As a child, his daughter said, Julius had a terrible stutter, which isolated him. But he worked hard on his own to conquer it, giving him a self-confidence he never lost.
Montgomery attended the Tuskegee Institute, the historically Black institution now known as Tuskegee University, where he studied to be a linotype operator. He graduated in 1951.
He worked briefly as a printer before joining the U.S. Air Force that year, serving until 1956.
"He did top-secret work for the Air Force, rewiring and servicing the receiving stations that took down signals from spy satellites." Paul, the author, said in a phone interview.
After the Air Force, Montgomery worked briefly as a radio station engineer in Mobile, Alabama. He applied for other jobs at other companies, but was told they didn't hire Black people.
He also applied for a job with the Radio Corporation of America at Cape Canaveral, figuring that his license as a first-class radio telescope operator might make him a good fit for the space program. He passed the entry-level test, and RCA offered him a job for $76 a week. He didn't respond. When RCA came back with an offer of $96 a week (about $924 in today's money) to work as an electronics technician in its development lab, he accepted and headed for Florida, becoming the first black professional employed at the space center.
He settled in Melbourne, just south of Cape Canaveral. In 1960 he married Gertrude Elizabeth (King), with whom he had two daughters, Gaye and Lisa Montgomery. After his wife died in 2003, he developed a close relationship with Annie Lewis, who was his companion until she died in 2015.
His daughters survive him, as do two grandchildren and six of his siblings: his sisters Doris Cook, Artney Turner, Rita Poole and Holly Montgomery, and his brothers Edward and Carl Montgomery.
After retiring from RCA in 1988, Montgomery started a general contracting business. He held positions in several organizations, including president of the Greater Melbourne chapter of the NAACP. He also spoke about his career at events around the country, among them a 2010 panel discussion at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington with, among others, astronaut Leland Melvin, one of 14 African Americans who have gone into space.
"I'll tell you," Montgomery told Melvin afterward, according to Paul. "You astronauts, you're the bravest people I ever met."
"No, sir," Melvin replied. "I heard your story out there. You are the bravest person I ever met."

Don't doubt Sanders in matchup with Trump

Texto completo: Stop saying that Bernie Sanders can't win.
Stop saying that he can't defeat President Donald Trnmp. That is by now a given. In fact, in head-tohead national polls, Sanders consistently outperforms Trump.
Sanders is, for the moment, the clear frent-runner to win the Democratic nomination. And he has a national infrastructure and a committed band of supporters and donors that make it clear that he could go the distance.
Furthermore, Sanders' impressive win in Nevada proves that he can attract a broad range of support, at least in one part of the country. This in particular is a significant feat. When Sa nders ran four years ago, the breadth of his appeal was indeed an issue. Since then, Sanders has recognized that shortcoming and has worked hard to address it.
If Sanders can sustain this momentum, he will be the nominee. And then it will be on to a matchup with Trump. Now, trying to predict what voters will do in November is dicey business, but I am by no means counting Sanders out.
Yes, I know all the issues with a Sanders candidacy.
First, he is a self-described democratic socialist. I don't believe most people know what that means, but it is different, and Trump will make it sound frightening, and many Americans are likely to be wary of it.
The larger problem here is that the absolute definition isn't quite fixed. In 2017, Vox's Jeff Stein wrote an artiс1з titled "9 questions about the Democratic Socialists oi America you were too embarrassed to ask."
Stein's first question was, "What does DSA believe in?" His answer:
"Like most socialist organizations, DSA believes in the abolition of capitalism in favor of an economy run either by 'the workers' or the state - though the exact specifics of'abolishing capitalism' are fiercely debated by socialists."
Not even academics agree. As Frances Fox Piven, a scholar of the left at the City University of New York and a former DSA board member, told Stein, "The academic debates about socialism's 'meaning' are huge and arcane and rife with disagreements, but what all definitions have in common is either the elimination of the market or its strict containment."
Sanders has his own definition, which he explained in a CNN town hall in Washington, D.C.:
"What democratic socialism means to me is having, in a civilized society, the understanding that we can make sure that all of our people live in security and in dignity. Health care is a human right."
He went on to say, "When I talk about democratic socialism, what I talk about are human rights and economic rights."
That's too broad and amorphous. This will be a tremendous hurdle. He will need to refine the term and defang it. But being in the throes of a presidential campaign is not exactly the time to educate the American people on an exotic political label.
In addition, the Russians and Trump seem to want him to win the nomination. That is worrisome. The Russians may well like some of Sanders' noninterventionist foreign policy instincts, but it is just as likely that they find Sanders to be the most destabilizing Democratic candidate. As Gleb Pavlovsky, a political scientist who used to advise Vladimir Putin, told GQ's Julia Ioffe, "Our candidate is chaos."
And, in the end, both the Russians and Trump presumably believe that Sanders will be the easiest to defeat.
Then there is the overall idea that Sanders is calling for nothing short of a political revolution that fundamentally reshapes the country. For some people, particularly many young ones, this is an extremely attractive idea. But for others it is absolutely terrifying.
"Medicare for All," one of Sanders central policies, has a problem gaining traction even among Democrats. As a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found, "Mere Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would prefer voting for a candidate who wants to build on the ACA in order to expand coverage and reduce costs rather than replace the ACA with a national Medicare for All plan."
Furthermore, there are jitters among the Democratic political class that Sanders is running against them, not with them, and will have a negative effect down ballot. Sanders' tweeted last week:
"I've got news for the Republican establishment. I've got news for the Democratic establishment. They can't stop us."
That establishment includes the Democrats now in office. It includes the Democratic majority that now controls the House of Representatives. Indeed, you could argue that it even includes Sanders himself.
Sanders has work to do. He has some very real hurdles to clear. And it will not be easy. His opponents would use every instrument at their disposal during a general election to tar and feather him.
But, all that stated, I still wouldn't doubt his ability to win. There is a very real desire for re al change in this country. It would be a mistake to discount it.

Texto completo: "Along the way, he has always been a beacon of light for his family, too, because he always tried to uplift them ... Some of it worked out, some of it failed, but he never, ever turned his back on them. "
Julius Franks
Grew up with Fred Walker
Fred Walker learned how to survive at a young age.
His mother was a drug addict who didn't come home for days at a time. His father wasn't around.
Three younger half-brothers became the responsibility he shouldered before he was 10 years old.
"I always worried about them coming up with a mother on drugs," said Walker, now a businessman. "My mom would be gone for days, for a week at a time. How do you feed your brothers?"
He vowed early in his life that he wouldn't follow her path, a trail of alcoholism to marijuana use to hard drugs.
But homelessness, hunger and an unstable home life tested him.
He would rely on the kindness of a woman in Philadelphia he refers to as his Godmom, and her guidance. She led him toward a life story he could write himself.
'The only way out of this life' In his teen years in North Philadelphia, Walker grew so desperate for money at one point that he stole a car. A puny kid behind the wheel of a pickup truck, he headed to a chop shop for some cash. The cops spotted him instantly, and he landed in juvenile detention.
"It showed me consequence, number one," he said. "It turned my life around. It showed me I never want to be in this situation."
It also gave him a chance to be a good student in the school residence program, to play basketball, and to not worry about home and the next meal.
"I could be a kid," he said.
But when he got out, his mother didn't want him at home. "I think it was easier (for her) to have less responsibility," he said. Eventually, a friend's mother took him in, gave him a bed and helped him graduate from high school.
"I knew the only way out of this life is education," he said. "Even being homeless at points in my life as a kid, I went to school. People (at school) would say, 'You're dirty. You stink."
They didn't know he lived in abandoned buildings at times.
When Sharon Franks-Govans, "Godmom," took him in, he was a young teenager. Her son, Julius Franks, knew about Walker's situation through a friend, so they gave him a bed for a few days. He stayed for years.
"He was the nicest kid ever. He was just less fortunate than I was at that particular time," said Franks, who is the same age as Walker. Raised for years together, most people now think they are actually brothers.
"Along the way, he has always been a beacon of light for his family, too, because he always tried to uplift them, tried to bring them out of their predicaments. Some of it worked out, some of it failed, but he never, ever turned his back on them," Franks said. "Everything he's done and built for York, he tried to do for his own family."
Franks-Govans had been a nurse in the military, and service to country was a path she encouraged for both Walker and her son.
"She gave me direction and purpose," Walker said. "You go through this turbulent life, so you have to make decisions. I made a decision to go into the military."
Before entering in the Army, though, he needed to connect to a broken relationship in his life.
Father figure At 18, Walker sought out his dad, a man who hadn't been around through his childhood.
He found that he couldn't relate to him. His father had never learned to read and hadn't seen much of the world. Conversations were stale, he said.
The father figure in his life was Morris Gandy, one of Walker's stepfathers, a Vietnam veteran.
"He was so proud of me as a stepdad," he said. "I didn't have a father there, but I had someone who I could talk to."
Walker's mother died in 1998, shot in her apartment in Philadelphia, still an unsolved murder, while Walker was in Germany with the Army. But Gandy threw a protective wing over all the children in his life until he died.
Years later, Walker named his business after him, Gandy Real Estate.
Walker and his half-brother, Dale Roane, had been very close growing up, but the shadow of their mother's life moved over Roane. He became a drug addict as well.
"As kids growing up, we were very, very close," Walker said.
When Roane got out of jail in 2018, Walker tried to help him by calling in a favor. Walker was on the board of directors with a recovery center and paid his brother's way.
Roane never showed up. Then, he went missing.
"I would hear stories about him being a panhandler," he said. They all tried to find him, but it was fruitless.
He died last year as a homeless drug addict in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, described by the New York Times as "the epicenter of Philadelphia's opioid crisis."
Walker had buried many family members, but this was different.
"It was a shocking moment of my life, to see my brother in that space, remembering all those moments that me and him had," Walker said. "The decisions in a person's life can end up in this manner."
After 10 years in the Army, Walker taught college classes in Washington, D.C., but it was an expensive place to live. He thought he could "live like a king" if he moved north, so he did.
The home he chose was near Mount Wolf. The boy who was homeless at times in his life had found a place where he could see the Susquehanna River from his back door. Now 44, he has lived there about 15 years with his two daughters, 19 and 17, and his wife, Janique Washington-Walker, assistant executive director of the Children's Aid Society.
In York, he plugged into the community by running a music store downtown and managing some entertainers, booking venues and traveling with them. While he still has a hand in that, he's focused on real estate now.
This week, he can be found at one of his properties, 30 Eberts Lane, where he is helping a tenant get his restaurant off the ground. Skillet2Plate Soul Bistro is expected to open this week under the ownership of Terence Days. Juan Cruz, formerly of the Left Bank, will be the chef.
It's the same place where Walker once took a troubled young man to show what hard work can create.
"You know who owns this? I own this entire block," Walker told him.
Among his many volunteer efforts, Walker is a leader with The Movement, a resource for city residents, connecting people in need with solutions. People write Facebook posts looking for housing - or even a prayer. Just recently, someone donated a truck to The Movement for residents to use for moving furniture.
"We're a helping hand up for people who are in difficult situations," Walker said.
He knows there are struggles behind every door. The rest of the world can't see other people's troubles, just like they hadn't seen his.
But that childhood - now decades ago - doesn't leave a person's soul. He still has fears.
He said: "Those things haunt me to this day: not having, being broke and being homeless."
It drives him forward - along with all the people he takes under his wing.

Texto completo: WEST HAVEN — The University of New Haven recommended Tuesday that students and faculty at its Tuscan campus return to the United States “due to the evolving threat of the coronavirus in Europe.”
President Steven H. Kaplan, a letter to the school community, said the institution would help students, faculty and staff who choose to return make it back to the United States in the coming days.
“Our main concern is ensuring the safety and wellbeing of everyone in our campus community. We also want to ensure a smooth transition back to the United States for students who wish to return from Prato and limit the disruption this has on our students’ current academic pursuits,” Kaplan said.
Those individuals will be “required to return to their homes” until the school’s spring break concludes March 22, at which time they will either have the chance to return to Tuscany or continue the spring semester in West Haven, he said.
The school will “do our best” to provide resources to students who decide to remain in Italy, Kaplan said.
Kaplan said the recommendation was made “following consultation with the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Consulate, the Italian Educational Ministry, the Italian Department of Civil Protection, Italian health authorities, and the Association of American College and University Programs in Italy.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued an alert for those considering traveling to Italy, suggesting that they take “enhanced precautions.”
Older people and people with chronic medical conditions “should consider postponing nonessential travel” to Italy, CDC officials said.
Doug Whiting, associate vice president for marketing and relations at UNH, said approximately 80 university students currently are studying at its Tuscan campus.
According to the New York Times, 322 cases of coronavirus were reported in Italy as of Tuesday, up from 229 the day prior, including in Tuscany.
The virus has “infected nearly 80,000 people in 37 countries” and caused “at least 2,600 deaths,” including 10 reported in Italy, according to the Times.
The strain of coronavirus sickening people in Italy and other countries is known as COVID-19.
According to Yale University, coronaviruses “are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, and more severe illnesses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).”

Getting To The Heart Of Presidential Fitness: How Much Do We Need To Know?

Texto completo: Differences in health policy weren’t the only bones presidential candidates had to pick last week. They also sparred over details of their personal health. And with the next debate and Super Tuesday primaries fast approaching, these skirmishes are likely to escalate.
In the run-up to the Las Vegas Democratic presidential primary face-off, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ national press secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, told CNN that opponents are trying to use his October heart attack against him. Then she mistakenly claimed that Mike Bloomberg “has suffered heart attacks in the past” — a statement she quickly walked back after a Bloomberg adviser said in a tweet it was a “Trumpy lie.”
He did not have a heart attack, Bloomberg’s camp explained, trying to differentiate its candidate’s health status. He had stents. The former New York mayor, according to the campaign, had coronary stents inserted two decades ago after a cardiac test indicated they might be useful.
Feathers still ruffled, the two candidates went at it again on the debate stage.
“I think the one area, maybe, that Mayor Bloomberg and I share, you have two stents, as well,” Sanders said Thursday to his rival onstage.
Bloomberg responded, “Twenty-five years ago.”
It’s not surprising, with the oldest crop ever of presidential candidates, that their vital signs are becoming a talking point.
“When it comes to politics, personal health is just one more issue to try and leverage,” said Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics at NYU School of Medicine in New York City.
That got us wondering how this information fits into the facts voters weigh. And in evaluating a candidate’s long-term health or electability, does it really matter whether a patient got a stent as part of treatment for a heart attack, like Sanders, or for another reason, such as to relieve chest pain or following a cardiac stress test, like Bloomberg?
“In this day and age, with the way technology has advanced and the skill sets of the cardiologists, I would say they are practically the same. We expect good results for both,” said Dr. Hadley Wilson, a practicing cardiologist in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a member of the American College of Cardiology’s board of trustees.
Stents are almost always used when a person is having a heart attack.
Heart attacks can occur when plaque breaks off inside the blood vessels of the heart, causing a blockage. To open the blocked artery, physicians insert stents, which are small, wire-mesh tubes. Afterward, patients are treated with medications to reduce the risk of subsequent heart attacks.
Back when Bloomberg got his, they were commonly used in nonemergency situations to prop open narrowing arteries, with the thought that might prevent a heart attack, said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a cardiologist in New York and a spokesperson for the American Heart Association.
But, since then, “we learned stents don’t prevent a heart attack and that using medication might be equally beneficial,” Steinbaum said, adding that the best preventive measures are lifestyle choices, such as eating a good diet, exercising and not smoking. Patients still sometimes get stents to alleviate symptoms, such as chest pain, or for other reasons.
Thursday’s debate also highlighted the broader question: Just how much of a candidate’s medical history is fair game for public consumption?
Sanders, who faced criticism in October for delays in reporting his condition, said he has since released “the full report of that heart attack” ― including letters from his primary care doctor and two cardiologists attesting to his overall health and recovery.
But candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said Sanders had not provided enough detail ― and neither, he said, had the others.
“Under President Obama, the standard was that the president would release full medical records, do a physical and release the readout,” he said during the debate. “Now, President Trump lowered that standard. He said just a letter from a doctor is enough. And a lot of folks on this stage are now saying that’s enough.”
Buttigieg himself has yet to provide a full medical record.
“But I am certainly prepared to get a physical, put out the results,” he said during the debate. “I think everybody here should be willing to do the same.”
Some observers agree there’s no such thing as TMI (too much information) when it comes to POTUS (the president of the United States).
“When the country is hiring someone to have their finger on the nuclear button, the expectation of personal privacy is very, very limited,” said David Blumenthal, head of the Commonwealth Fund and co-author of “The Heart of Power: Health and Politics in the Oval Office.” “It’s hard to imagine something [health-related] that would not be relevant.”
That argument, though, doesn’t always hold up.
When he ran for president in 2008, the then-70-year-old Sen. John McCain released more than 1,000 pages of his medical records.
By contrast, the campaigning Donald Trump initially released a glowing letter from his personal physician that concluded he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” After criticism that the letter lacked specifics, Trump added information on his height, weight and cholesterol levels and went on to become the oldest president, at age 70, to take office, beating out Ronald Reagan, who was just weeks shy of that milestone on Inauguration Day in 1981.
This year, candidates Bloomberg and Sanders are both 78; former Vice President Joe Biden, 77; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is 59, and Buttigieg is the youngest, at 38.
Anything that might be “relevant to a candidate’s ability and competence to govern and their longevity of service” should be disclosed, said Blumenthal, who is also a medical doctor.
Voters could then decide what they thought was important. The information might also affect how voters view the choice of a vice president, especially if the candidate for the highest office had a serious illness or something else that might limit their term, he said.
Specifically which records, though, and how to release them is a complicated issue.
Caplan, at NYU, has long advocated setting up a special independent medical panel to evaluate presidential candidates’ health ― and make their findings public.
“It would be like an executive physical, which is what a lot of companies do before they pick a CEO,” he said.
And deciding what to test for would be, in itself, complicated. Without a special panel ― which, even Caplan admits, would meet political inertia ― the challenges would be numerous. Even locating all the necessary records would be difficult.
The candidates “may have moved around the country, their doctors may have died, or records may not be available,” noted Lawrence Altman, who covered many presidential elections as a reporter for The New York Times and is now a global scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
While there is no specific requirement that candidates release any information at all, what readers ― and voters ― want to know varies widely.
“It depends on their interest in the candidate,” Altman said. “A lot of people superimpose their political choices or feelings on the medical aspect. They are willing to dismiss something if they really like the candidate or make a big issue about it if they don’t like the candidate.”

New Virginia law allows DC sniper to apply for parole in 2024

Texto completo: Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam signed a juvenile sentencing bill into law this week that creates the possibility for the parole of convicted D.C. sniper Lee Malvo.
The new law allows people serving life sentences for crimes committed before the age of 18 to be considered for release after they have served 20 years in prison.
Lee Boyd Malvo, 35, received four life sentences in Virginia for his participation in the greater Washington, D.C., area sniper shootings that killed 10 people in 2002. A 17-year-old at the time, Malvo claimed he was indoctrinated by John Allen Muhammad and convinced to take part in a crime spree that stretched across the United States. Muhammad was sentenced to death and executed in 2009.
The Supreme Court was weighing whether Malvo deserves a new hearing as a result of recent rulings barring life sentences for juveniles, but Malvo’s lawyers dropped the case after learning of the new sentencing rules in Virginia.
Malvo’s life sentence will remain in effect, but he is now eligible for parole in 2024, according to Fox 5 DC.
Malvo also faces six life sentences without the possibility of parole in Maryland and is challenging those sentences in a separate proceeding. He additionally could be charged with murder in other states, according to the New York Times.
“I was a monster,” Malvo said about his actions in 2012. “If you look up the definition, that’s what a monster is. I was a ghoul. I was a thief. I stole people’s lives. I did someone else’s bidding just because they said so. ... There is no rhyme or reason or sense.”
Some family members of the victims of Malvo’s attack expressed dismay at the thought of his parole.
“I’m not ready for that all,” said Cheryl Shaw, whose father was killed during Malvo's and Muhammad’s crime spree. “He’s where he’s supposed to be.”

Chris Wallace says Jim Acosta's behavior 'adds to people questioning the credibility of the media'

Texto completo: Fox News host Chris Wallace slammed CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta over a verbal altercation between Acosta and President Trump during a press conference.
Wallace, the host of Fox News Sunday, bashed Acosta for his behavior at Trump's Tuesday press conference in India during an event later that evening with New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman put on by the Columbia Journalism School.
"I was horrified by [Acosta]," Wallace explained. "It’s not our job to get in fights with presidents. It’s not our job to one-up presidents. It’s our job to report on presidents. … But to the degree we have responded to his attacks on us with attacks or advocacy in kind, there’s a huge mistake, and I think adds to people questioning the credibility of the media."
He also expressed fear over the belief that the president's attacks on the media have given reporters the justification to fight back.
"I worry that the president’s attacks have given too many straight news reporters, not talking about the opinion page or prime time, an excuse or license to cross the line themselves and become players on the field, and I think that is a huge mistake. It’s not our role," Wallace added. "Our role is to be observers, umpires, fact-checkers, investigators — it’s not to be advocates. It’s not to be opponents."
Haberman, after Wallace concluded, said she agreed with him.
Facebook
In the viral exchange between the CNN White House correspondent and the president, Acosta began by asking if Trump would pledge not to accept foreign assistance in the upcoming elections, to which the president said, "I want no help from any country."
"I haven't been given help from any country. And if you see what CNN, your wonderful network, said, I guess they apologized in a way for — didn't they apologize for the fact that they said certain things that weren't true?" the president inquired of Acosta, referring to CNN's coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
"Mr. President, I think our record on delivering the truth is a lot better than yours sometimes, if you don't mind me saying," Acosta said to Trump, who fired back at the anchor's history of reporting.
"Your record is so bad, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You probably have the worst record in the history of broadcasting," the president said.
A CNN spokesman responded to Wallace's remarks on Twitter, saying journalists shouldn't take the Fox News anchor's advice.
"Chris Wallace literally works for state TV," he tweeted. "I don’t think @Acosta or any real journalist ought to be taking advice from him. Chris, if only you spent as much time and effort sharing these morsels of wisdom with your own colleagues ... "

'Putin wants to be the center of attention': Russia meddles in US elections hoping to sow mistrust, experts say

Texto completo: Russia’s alleged efforts to meddle in the 2020 elections likely are part of Vladimir Putin’s plan to make the Kremlin appear to have an outsize influence as it generates mistrust in the U.S. electoral process, national security experts say.

“Putin wants to be the center of attention,” Daniel Hoffman, the CIA’s former Moscow station chief, told the Washington Examiner. “If you look at your Google machine right now, there’s probably eight billion articles about why Russia supports Sanders and Trump. Putin doesn’t even care what the story involves — Russia being part of the story of our elections, he wins.”
Hoffman’s warning came amid a flurry of disputed reports that Russia might be attempting to help 2020 Democratic front-runner Sen. Bernie Sanders win the party’s nomination and may be trying to boost President Trump's reelection campaign.
“It makes us all think that he’s playing a role, which is the best way, with that touch of conspiracy, to really diminish our trust in our democracy,” the CIA veteran said of the KGB officer turned Russian president. “He wants our candidates to be on the defensive and to have one side accuse the other of being subjected to Russian influence.”
The issue was raised during a controversial classified House Intelligence Committee briefing earlier this month. Shelby Pierson, the election threats executive under then-acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, conducted part of it. During the meeting, sources cited by the New York Times on Thursday claimed Pierson warned that “Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected.”
Special counsel Robert Mueller’s two-year investigation concluded that “the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion," but did not establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians.
There was swift pushback from GOP congressmen present as well as from anonymous officials.
Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas said he could not provide specifics about a classified briefing but did say this “allegedly anti-Trump” story is “not accurate.”
His comments echo denials made by a national security official cited by CNN’s Jake Tapper on Friday.
“The intelligence doesn't say that,” Tapper’s source said. “The problem is Shelby said they developed a preference for Trump. A more reasonable interpretation of the intelligence is not that they have a preference — it's a step short of that.”
The national security official added that “it's more that they understand the president is someone they can work with … but not that they prefer him over” his Democratic opponents.
CNN reported on Sunday that “one intelligence official said that Pierson's characterization of the intelligence was ‘misleading’ and a national security official said Pierson failed to provide the ‘nuance’ needed to accurately convey the U.S. intelligence conclusions.” And on Monday, the outlet cited a senior official claiming that “the Intelligence Community did not state that Russia is aiding the reelection of President Trump.”

Trump called it “another misinformation campaign.”
Sanders was briefed last month about a Russian interference effort aimed at disrupting the Democratic presidential primaries, unnamed sources told the Washington Post on Friday. The article noted it is not clear what form the "Russian assistance" has taken.
The independent Vermont senator responded immediately.
“Let’s be clear, the Russians want to undermine American democracy by dividing us up and, unlike the current president, I stand firmly against their efforts, and any other foreign power that wants to interfere in our election,” Sanders said. “I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections.”

David Porter, the assistant section chief of the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force, said Monday that Kremlin interference efforts were “brazen and disruptive” and “Russia wants to watch us tear ourselves apart.”
“It's designed to degrade confidence at the very foundation of our democratic system and our leaders' ability to govern,” Porter said according to CNN, adding, “It's also designed to weaken the adversary from within by identifying existing political and social issues and driving wedges into those fractural lines.”

Hoffman said Putin’s efforts were meant to divide — and might even be meant to be discovered.
“If he’s doing it in a discoverable way, then he’s doing it to soil Sen. Sanders’s reputation. That’s what I think he was doing to then-candidate Trump too,” Hoffman said. “And that’s why he wants it to have a Kremlin return address — because it’s a little more exciting and a little bit more conspiratorial.”
FBI Director Christopher Wray testified this month that Russian efforts “to sow discord on both sides of an issue and to generate controversy and to generate distrust in our democratic institutions on our election process” have “never stopped.”
Fiona Hill, the National Security Council’s former Russia expert and a Ukraine impeachment witness, testified last year that the Russians sought to hurt both Hillary Clinton and Trump in 2016.
"The goal of the Russians was really to put whoever became the president ... under a cloud," Hill said. “They seed misinformation. They seed doubt.”

More than a dozen killed in Delhi clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups during Trump visit to India

Texto completo: India’s capital was rocked by the worst violence in decades as Hindu and Muslim groups clashed over a new immigration law.
At least 13 people were killed and more wounded in the clashes that began on Sunday and have continued into Tuesday. The fighting comes as President Trump makes his first presidential visit to the country and attends high-level meetings just miles away from the violence.
The unrest is in response to the Citizenship Amendment Act, which has been labeled as anti-Muslim by some in India. The CAA, which was passed last year, gives amnesty to immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh as long as they are not Muslim.
Delhi Protests
Critics say the law is discriminatory for excluding Muslims, but the government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, contends it protects religious minorities from those countries.
There have been protests against the CAA since last year, but Delhi has seen the worst violence yet in recent days. On Tuesday, a mosque was vandalized, with a video showing men attempting to rip the crescent from its minaret. Both Hindus and Muslims have blamed the other side for starting the clashes.
“The situation is volatile and tense,” Alok Kumar, a senior police officer, told the New York Times. “It’s a mixed neighborhood, and in seconds you can have crowds of tens of thousands. Even a small thing can lead to violence.”
Delhi Protests
Muslim residents have accused Hindu police officers of being complicit in the violence and standing by without intervening while they were beaten by mobs. The rival groups have hurled stones at each other and were seen on video burning down buildings, including a tire shop.
Trump declined to comment about the controversial law when asked during his visit.
“I don’t want to discuss that. I want to leave that to India, and hopefully, they’re going to make the right decision for the people,” the president said.

Texto completo: CORONAVIRUS IMPACTING EXERCISES: With South Korea now reporting the second-highest number of coronavirus infections in the world, U.S. and South Korean commanders are moving to reduce the joint military exercises that had already been scaled back to support diplomatic efforts to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal.
At a news conference yesterday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed that U.S. Korea commander Gen. Robert Abrams and his counterpart Gen. Park Han-ki are concerned that an upcoming “command post” exercise, which would bring U.S. and South Korean troops into close contact inside buildings, could increase the chances of spreading the virus.
South Korea has experienced a spike in coronavirus cases, which now total 977, a 15-fold increase in a week, including 13 cases among the South Korean armed forces. “As you're well aware, due to the coronavirus in Korea, the situation is quite serious,” South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-Doo told reporters at the Pentagon yesterday. “Because of that, currently the exercise and the Korean units are being curtailed… We will find out the situation and decide how we are going to conduct our exercises.”
ANTI-VIRUS FUNDS REQUESTED: The White House has sent Congress a request for $2.5 billion in emergency funds to address coronavirus outbreak, which is threatening to become a global pandemic.
“Today, the Administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies,” said White House budget office spokeswoman Rachel Semmel. “We are also freeing up existing resources and allowing for greater flexibilities for response activities.”
STILL READY TO FIGHT TONIGHT: Esper stressed that the adjustments in joint exercises with South Korea that are intended to limit the risk posed by the viral infection would not significantly impact the combat readiness of the combined U.S. and South Korea forces.
“As those two gentleman, officers address any concerns, I'm sure that we will remain fully ready to deal with any threats that we might face together,” Esper said.
FAR APART ON BURDEN SHARING: It was clear in yesterday's joint news conference that the U.S. and South Korea are still at an impasse over the U.S. demand that South Korea increase its annual payment to the United States from less than $1 billion to $5 billion.
“The current Special Measures Agreement captures only a portion of the overall costs associated with the United States' defense of South Korea. The United States believes it should cover more,” Esper said. “Shouldering the cost of our common defense cannot fall disproportionately to the American taxpayer… As a global economic powerhouse and an equal partner in the preservation of peace on the peninsula, South Korea can and should contribute more to its defense.”
Esper has given South Korea one month to make a deal before the U.S. military begins laying off up to 9,000 Korea workers at U.S. bases. “The minister and I are both hopeful that they'll reach agreement soon, preferably before the end of March. Otherwise, beginning April 1st we will begin furloughing Korean national workers.”
South Korea has offered an increase in the annual payments, but nothing close to what the U.S. is asking for. Minister Jeong suggested South Korea might be willing to pick up the salaries of Korea workers to avoid layoffs, while negotiations continue.

HAPPENING TODAY: A week packed with budget hearings begins in earnest today when Gen. Tod Wolters, U.S. European and supreme NATO commander and Gen. Stephen Lyons, U.S. transportation commander appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee at 9:30 a.m.
Tomorrow Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley testify before the House Armed Services Committee, and on Thursday that committee hears from acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday, and Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger.
Check calendar below for links and livestream information.
UNFUNDED PRIORITIES: After the president submits his budget to Congress, the military services and supporting commanders get to weigh in with a list of things they would buy if they just had a little more money.
In a letter to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, Gen. Lyons, the TRANSCOM commander, says his top unfunded priority is aerial refueling, and he is seeking an additional $110 million to buy back 23 of the KC-10 and KC-135 tankers targeted for cuts, according to Air Force Magazine.
The proposed cuts would “creates a capacity gap with significant impacts to Combatant Command daily competition and wartime missions,” writes Lyons, who argues the gap “negatively impacts senior leader decision space for mobilization when confronted with a crisis.”
ANOTHER $4.2 BILLION: Meanwhile the Air Force has submitted a $4.2 billion unfunded priorities request, which includes roughly $3.2 billion for the Air Force and an additional $1 billion for the new Space Force, according to Air Force Magazine.
“The request, which is significantly higher than the extra $2.8 billion the Air Force wanted in fiscal 2020, asks for an additional $1.3 billion for 12 more F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and long-lead support items. If Congress approves that addition, USAF would buy 60 F-35As in 2021,” the magazine reports.
INDIA’S $3 BILLION BUY: During his 36 hour trip to India, President Trump announced that India had agreed to purchase more than $3 billion of advanced military equipment from the United States, including Apache attack and MH-60 Romeo Seahawk helicopters.
The MH-60R is a maritime helicopter made by Sikorsky, a division of Lockheed Martin. The sale had already been approved by the State Department almost a year ago.
The AH-64 Apache is made by Boeing, which calls it “the world’s most advanced multi-role combat helicopter.”
ETHICAL AI: The Pentagon officially adopted a series of ethical principles for the use of Artificial Intelligence based on recommendations from the Defense Innovation Board last October. The recommendations came after 15 months of consultation with leading AI experts in commercial industry, government, academia and the American public, the Pentagon said.
“AI technology will change much about the battlefield of the future, but nothing will change America's steadfast commitment to responsible and lawful behavior,” said Defense Secretary Esper in a statement.

Are nonwhites voting more like other Americans?

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders’s victories in the inaccurately counted Iowa caucuses, in the crisply conducted New Hampshire primary, and in the Nevada caucuses have made two things clear.
One is that the Vermont senator, elected and reelected to Congress as an independent, is on the high road to become the oldest political party in the world’s 35th presidential nominee, as I have argued in two columns.
The second is less obvious but potentially of more lasting importance: that the monolithic voting behavior of citizens classified as nonwhite, assumed by prophets to continue endlessly a lasting Democratic majority, may be ending.
The black community has been voting around 90% Democratic for more than half a century, since 1964. For a similar period, from the Civil War to the Great Depression, it voted (when and where permitted to) almost unanimously Republican.
But for the last half-century, blacks have also voted almost unanimously for one candidate in presidential primaries, even against sympathetic opponents: for Robert Kennedy over Hubert Humphrey, for Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton.
In 2016, there were already signs of change. In the Michigan primary, blacks were split. Clinton won the black vote 68% to 28%, according to the exit poll. And the general election poll showed black women essentially unanimous (a 90-point margin in Clinton's favor) but black men noticeably less so at 82% to 13%, for a 69-point margin.
This year, Joe Biden, the first black president’s choice for vice president, has been counting on near-unanimous support from black voters. But he’s not getting it.
The Nevada caucus entrance poll showed him leading Sanders by just 39% to 27% among blacks, a population that accounts for 11% of Nevadans. That's a far cry from Clinton’s 88% to 11% win over Sanders in South Carolina in the 2016 primary. That margin was eight times greater and would amount to 8 whole percentage points of the Nevada electorate — a big difference in a contest where nonblacks are closely divided.
Nor is Biden getting the near-unanimous support his backers assumed in polls in South Carolina, whose Democratic primary electorate was 61% black last time. February South Carolina polling shows Biden leading Sanders by just 24% to 21% and averaging only 36% among blacks in three polls.
There’s also at least fragmentary evidence that President Trump may run better with black voters, especially young men, than he or other Republicans have for many years.
What seems to be happening here? It makes sense for people who identify as members of a disfavored minority group to vote unanimously for one party or one candidate. “Unity,” the word I’ve heard black preachers repeat over and over when favored candidates appear at services, increases their leverage.
But there eventually comes a time when racial identity chafes less and other issues obtrude. The New Deal got many blacks to abandon the party of Abraham Lincoln. Despite the lamentations of Ta-Nehisi Coates and the New York Times’s 1619 Project, perceptions that race relations have improved and black unemployment has plunged in the Trump years to the lowest level ever measured may switch some black voters away from the party of Lyndon Johnson.
What about Hispanics voters, who, unlike blacks, are increasing (slowly) as a percentage of the electorate? For many years, it was assumed that their paramount issue was immigration. But they never voted unanimously or uniformly across the country. And the Hispanic subgroup closest to unanimity (Puerto Ricans in New York) was always made up of U.S. citizens.
Nor did they recoil, as expected, from Trump in 2016. He actually ran slightly better among Hispanics than Mitt Romney had four years earlier. They formed no more than 3% of the electorate in states that turned out to be pivotal in 2016, aside from Florida, where both Trump and Republican statewide candidates in 2018 got enough Hispanic votes to win.
Hispanics tend to be younger and lower-income than average. That helps explain why Sanders, who has been running best with young and low-income voters, won 51% of Hispanics in Nevada, compared to 29% of whites and 27% of blacks. So, in this year's primaries, Hispanics seem so far to be voting similarly to whites of similar age and economic situation.
In contrast, the three candidates favored by white college graduates with more liberal records on immigration — Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar — got only a combined 21% of Nevada Hispanics’ votes.
Bottom line: Blacks and Hispanics, to different degrees, are upending the notion that “nonwhite” voters are ineluctably wedded to the Democratic Party and walled off from the rest of political America.

Texto completo: A number of people criticized the moderators after Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate.
The debate, which was hosted by CBS News, featured seven presidential candidates: Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former mayors Michael Bloomberg of New York City and Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, former Vice President Joe Biden, and billionaire Tom Steyer.
The Democratic debate was mired with candidates talking over one another, and other members of the media criticized how the moderators managed the debate.
The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler said, "The moderators have lost complete control of this debate," while Wajahat Ali of the New York Times and CNN called it "a dumpster fire" and argued the moderators "really dropped the ball."
TweetTweet
Meghan McCain compared the debate’s atmosphere to that of the more contentious moments on The View.
"These moderators need to get this under control," she said, while CNN's Brian Stelter added, "Debates are hard. TV news rivalries are hardcore. That said, debate pros at other TV networks are exchanging messages calling this a 'disaster,' a 'nightmare' and worse."

Utah Republican women say they are not an ‘endangered species’

Texto completo: The number of Republican women in the U.S. House declined in the past decade and many statehouses don’t fare much better. Standing in contrast is the rising number of Democratic women elected to office.
That led a historian to write that “Republican women are in crisis.”
It is a sentiment that doesn’t sit well with some Utah women.
“That’s ridiculous,” said Enid Mickelsen, the first female Republican from the Beehive State elected to the U.S. House.
She served one term starting in 1995. No women from Utah, Republican or Democratic, are serving in Congress now. In Utah, one of the most conservative states in the nation, the Legislature includes 16 Democratic women and 10 Republican women.
Those stats cloud reality, argues Kari Malkovich, a Woodland Hills city councilwoman and first vice president of the Utah Federation of Republican Women. She said a more accurate snapshot would include the GOP women involved at all levels of government.
Malkovich pointed to Republican women serving in city councils and campaigns and executive offices, such as Kirsten Rappleye, chief of staff to the lieutenant governor, and Kristen Cox, executive director of the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget.
“Republican women are not an endangered species,” said Kendra Seeley, Utah Republican Party secretary.
About 30 women joined Seeley and the Utah Federation of Republican Women on Monday in the Capitol Rotunda for an event held in reaction to the December opinion piece in The New York Times that described the future of Republican women as “bleak.” That column, written by Nancy L. Cohen, blames the presidency of Donald Trump for blunting any momentum GOP women had. She warned that his reelection would make things even worse.
“If Mr. Trump wins, given his unpopularity with female voters, the future for Republican women in politics looks very bleak indeed,” Cohen wrote.
The Republican women who gathered in Utah on Monday say that’s not the case.
“We are refuting that there is a weakness in Republican women,” Malkovich said.

Of the 127 women serving in Congress, just 22 are Republican, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. There are more than two times as many Democratic women as Republican women in state legislatures across the country.
In Utah, 195 women have served in the Legislature since 1897, including eight Republican women in the Senate and 75 Republican women in the House, according to a February report from the Utah Women and Leadership Project. This session, a record number of women — 26 — serve in the Legislature, including 10 Republicans. In all, there are 104 Utah lawmakers.
“If you’re just looking at the numbers,” Malliga Och, an Idaho State University assistant professor who’s researched women in conservative parties, said calling it a crisis is a “fair characterization.”
But Och said she doesn’t think there’s an “ideological crisis” because “there are plenty of conservative women who would make brilliant and great legislators,” but “the problem is that they are not running."
“The main hurdle for Republican women is in the primary process,” according to Och. The Republican Party doesn’t have the same level of proactive recruiting and fundraising efforts directed toward women as the Democratic Party, she said.
Republican Rep. Candice Pierucci said she’d like to examine places such as Alaska and Arizona, which have a higher number of Republican women serving in the state Legislature than the national average, to see “what can we do better.” To get more Utah women in positions, Republicans have “to build up our bench like you would with any sport."
“Conservative women can and should run," Pierucci said.
If you don’t see women in these positions, though, it can be hard to picture yourself in them, Pierucci said. Only two women have been elected to Utah’s five statewide executive offices, and just four women have served in Congress, according to the Utah Women and Leadership Project. The last being GOP Rep. Mia Love, who was edged out by Democrat Ben McAdams in 2018.
But this year, Republican women — including GOP activists Mary Burkett and Kathleen Anderson, state Rep. Kim Coleman, Kaysville Mayor Katie Witt, and Morgan County Councilwoman Tina Cannon — are running in congressional races.
“If you’re going to change what comes out of D.C., you’ve got to change who goes into D.C.," Witt said. “And the quickest way to change that is get more Republican women in Congress.”
“The more women that we can get involved in executive level and legislative level positions to help make those decisions, the better,” said Aimee Winder Newton, who is one of two Republican women running for Utah governor, along with businesswoman Jan Garbett.
Jennifer Hogge, Lisa Bagley and Lorraine Brown were a few of the Republican women at the Capitol who said they are seeking seats in the state Legislature. Hogge said she’s never run for office before but felt she could use her experience as a teacher to work on education issues.
To get more women on the ballot, Seeley, the secretary of Utah’s Republican Party, suggested people must encourage more women to step forward.
“Support good women who do run," she said, “not just because they’re females, but because you believe in them.”
Generally, Republicans “try to be careful to avoid identity politics,” said Pierucci, who claimed her House seat after the incumbent resigned. Salt Lake County Republican delegates selected her and Gov. Gary Herbert formally appointed her to the post. She’s serving in her first session.
Pierucci wanted people to vote for her based on her credentials, not because she’s female, she said.
That’s a point that Mickelsen makes about her race in 1994.
“I didn’t set out to become the first woman Republican elected to Congress from the state of Utah,” she said. “I presented myself because I thought I was a good, qualified candidate.
“My attitude was always if I do the best job that I can and show people that I am qualified, that helps the next woman coming up behind me."
While there’s still more work to do, Mickelsen sees more women in office today than when she ran 25 years ago. And, in the future, “more will come," she said.
For Och, the Idaho State professor, part of why Republicans should elect more women is “simply fairness,” to better represent the population. But another reason is that to have gender equity in government, “we cannot just elect one specific kind of woman," she said.
“Women are not a homogenous bloc. They have different opinions," Och said. “And if we truly believe in this diversity that women bring, we need to elect a diverse body of women to the party, to both parties, and not just pro-life Democratic women, but also more conservative women.”

Texto completo: “So, how much money do you guys make if I do that test you’re ordering for me?” This is a question I hear frequently from my patients, and it’s often followed by some variant of, “I thought hospitals were supposed to be nonprofit.”
Patients are understandably confused. They see hospitals consolidating and creating vast medical empires with sophisticated marketing campaigns and sleek digs that resemble luxury hotels. And then there was the headline-grabbing nugget from a Health Affairs study that seven of the 10 most profitable hospitals in America are nonprofit hospitals.
Hospitals fall into three financial categories. Two are easy to understand: There are fully private hospitals that mostly function like any other business, responsible to shareholders and investors. And there are public hospitals, which are owned by state or local governments and have obligations to care for underserved populations. And then there are “private nonprofit” hospitals, which include more than half of our hospitals.
Nearly all of the nation’s most prestigious hospitals are nonprofits. These are the medical meccas that come to mind when we think of the best of American medicine — Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Mass General.
The nonprofit label comes from the fact that they are exempt from federal and local taxes (usually including property tax, payroll tax and sales tax) in exchange for providing a certain amount of “community benefit.”
Nonprofit hospitals have their origins in the charity hospitals of the early 1900s, but over the last century they’ve gradually shifted from that model. Now their explosive growth has many questioning — with good reason — how we define “nonprofit” and what sort of responsibility these hospitals have to the communities that provide this financial dispensation.
It’s time to rethink the concept of nonprofit hospitals. Tax exemption is a gift provided by the community and should be treated as such. Hospitals’ community benefit should be defined more explicitly in terms of tangible medical benefits for local residents.
It actually isn’t much of a surprise that nonprofit hospitals are often more profitable than for-profit hospitals. If a private business doesn’t have to pay taxes, its profit margin will be higher. Additionally, because nonprofit hospitals are defined as charitable institutions, they can benefit from tax-free contributions from donors and tax-free bonds for capital projects, things that for-profit hospitals cannot take advantage of.
The real question surrounding nonprofit hospitals is whether the benefits to the community equal what taxpayers donate to these hospitals in the form of tax-exempt status.
On paper, the average value of community benefits for all nonprofits about equals the value of the tax exemption, but there is tremendous variation among individual hospitals, with many falling short. There is also intense disagreement about how those community benefits are calculated and whether they actually serve the community in question.
Charity medical care is what most people think of when it comes to community benefit, and before 1969 that was the legal requirement for hospitals to qualify for tax-exempt status. In that year, the tax code was changed to allow for a wide range of expenses to qualify as community benefit. Charitable care became optional and it was left up to the hospitals to decide how to pay back that debt. Hospitals could even declare that accepting Medicaid insurance was a community benefit and write off the difference between the Medicaid payment and their own calculations of cost.
An analysis by Politico found that since the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act coverage expansion, which brought millions more paying customers into the field, revenue in the top seven nonprofit hospitals (as ranked by U.S. News & World Report) increased by 15 percent, while charity care — the most tangible aspect of community benefit — decreased by 35 percent.
Communities are often conflicted about the nonprofit hospitals in their midst. Many of these institutions are enormous employers — sometimes the largest employer in town — but the economic benefits do not always trickle down to the immediate neighborhoods. It is not unusual to see a stark contrast between these gleaming campuses and the disadvantaged neighborhoods in which they are located.
In some communities, nonprofit hospitals are beloved institutions with a history of caring for generations of families. In other communities, the sums of money devoted to lavish expansions, aggressive advertising and eye-popping executive compensation are a source of irritation.
The average chief executive’s package at nonprofit hospitals is worth $3.5 million annually. (According to I.R.S. regulations, the profits of nonprofit hospitals are not supposed to be benefiting any individual.) From 2005 to 2015, average chief executive compensation in nonprofit hospitals increased by 93 percent. Over that same time period, pediatricians saw a 15 percent salary increase. Nurses got 3 percent.
A number of communities that think nonprofit hospitals take more than they give back have started to sue. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center fought off one lawsuit from the city’s mayor to revoke its tax-exempt status. Last year it faced another from the Pennsylvania attorney general, alleging that the medical center, valued at $20 billion, did not fulfill “its obligation as a public charity” (the lawsuit was dismissed).
Morristown Hospital in New Jersey lost most of its property-tax exemption because it was found to be behaving as a for-profit institution. The judge in the case wrote that if all nonprofit hospitals operated like this, then “modern nonprofit hospitals are essentially legal fictions.”
It’s important to recognize the extreme variance in hospitals’ financial status. Many nonprofit hospitals, especially in rural areas, struggle mightily; scores of rural hospitals have closed — and hundreds more are teetering — leading to spikes in local death rates. At the other end are hospitals that earn several thousand dollars in profit per patient .
The most profitable nonprofit hospitals tend to be part of huge health care systems. Consolidations are one of the driving forces behind the towering profits, because monopoly hospitals are known to charge more than nonmonopoly hospitals.
Should these highly profitable institutions be exempt from the taxes that pay for local roads, police services, fire protection and 911 services? Should local residents have to pay for the garbage collection for institutions that can afford multimillion-dollar salaries for top executives?
Tax exemption needs to be redefined. Low-impact projects such as community health fairs that function more like marketing shouldn’t be allowed as part of the calculation. Nor should things that primarily benefit the institution, like staff training.
Additionally, hospitals should not be allowed to declare Medicaid “losses” as a community benefit. While it’s true that Medicaid typically pays less than private insurance companies, Medicaid plays a crucial role for private insurance markets by acting as a high-risk pool for patients with severe illness and disability. Hospitals benefit mightily from this taxpayer-funded arrangement. These large medical centers also enthusiastically accept taxpayer money for research, something that burnishes their image and bolsters their rankings. That enthusiasm needs to be mandated to extend toward Medicaid patients and the face value of their insurance.
The I.R.S. states that charitable hospitals “must be organized and operated exclusively for specific tax-exempt purposes.” Thus charitable care should be front and center. Spending on social determinants of health can also be a legitimate community benefit, but the community that is footing the tax break needs to have a forceful say in how this money is spent, rather than leave it solely up to the hospital.
As many policy scholars have noted, tax exemption is a blunt instrument. For struggling hospitals, particularly in communities with a shortage of health care resources, tax exemption can make sense. In medically saturated areas, where profits and executive compensation approach Wall Street levels, tax exemption should raise eyebrows.
If society decides that tax exemption is a worthwhile means to improve health — and it certainly can be — then our regulations need to be far stricter and more explicitly tied to community health. As the United States continues to fall behind its international peers in terms of health outcomes in local communities, there is certainly no lack of opportunity.

Paul Krugman: Republican cynicism may win Trump reelection

Texto completo: It may have slipped by you, but last week Donald Trump suggested that he may be about to give U.S. farmers — who have yet to see any benefits from his much-touted trade deal with China — another round of government aid. This would be on top of the billions in farm aid that Trump has already delivered, costing taxpayers several times as much as Barack Obama’s auto bailout — a bailout Republicans fiercely denounced as “welfare” and “crony capitalism” at the time.
If this sounds to you like a double standard — Democratic bailouts bad, Republican bailouts good — that’s because it is. But it should be seen as part of a broader pattern of breathtaking fiscal hypocrisy, in which the GOP went from insisting that federal debt posed an existential threat under Obama to complete indifference to budget deficits under Trump. This 180-degree turn is, as far as I can tell, the most cynical policy reversal of modern times.
And this cynicism may win Trump the election.
If Trump does win, there will be many recriminations among Democrats, especially about the vanity candidates who continue to fragment the field despite having no realistic chance of becoming the nominee. But while these recriminations will have much truth to them, the biggest factor working in Trump’s favor is a strong economy — not as strong as he claims, but good enough to provide a significant political lift (unless growth is derailed by the coronavirus).
And what’s driving the U.S. economy now is the very deficit spending Republicans pretended to be horrified by during the Obama years.
Trump likes to bad-mouth the Obama economy. In reality, from 2010 onward, America experienced steady growth in both GDP and employment — and there was no upward break in the trend after 2016. But recovery from the 2007-09 recession could and should have been faster.
What slowed recovery? Unprecedented fiscal austerity. In particular, government spending grew far more slowly during the Obama recovery than it did under either George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan.
Does fiscal austerity hurt growth? Yes. We’ve seen this fact demonstrated again and again over the past decade, most recently in Japan, where an ill-advised effort by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to reduce the budget deficit sent the economy plunging at a 6% annual rate. And the austerity of the Obama years definitely slowed recovery; without those spending cuts, unemployment might well have fallen to 4% as early as 2014.
So who was responsible for all this austerity? The answer, overwhelmingly, is Republicans in Congress. Remember, they threatened to create a financial crisis by refusing to raise the debt limit unless Obama cut spending.
Again, they insisted that austerity was essential because government debt was an enormous threat to America. But they lost all interest in deficits as soon as one of their own occupied the White House. Trump inherited a $600 billion deficit; he’s blown that up to $1 trillion — and hardly a single Republican in Congress has expressed dismay.
How much have Trump’s deficits boosted the economy? Well, they’re poorly designed stimulus; the biggest item was tax cuts for corporations, which corporations used to buy back stock rather than to expand their businesses or raise wages. But while the Trump stimulus probably didn’t deliver much bang per buck, it involved a heck of a lot of bucks.
And Trump’s economy also gets a lift from the fact that Republicans have ended the de facto economic sabotage that prevailed throughout the Obama years.
Incidentally, the experience of the past three years also refutes two of the main arguments used to justify the disastrous turn to austerity after the financial crisis — claims that deficits would hurt confidence and lead to a sharp rise in interest rates. None of this has happened.
So how can Democrats run against Republican fiscal hypocrisy? Not by warning about the dangers of deficits — that’s both wrong on the substance and politically ineffective, because nobody cares.
They might do better by pointing out that while Trump has rushed to cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy, he has been shortchanging the future. Ignoring his campaign promises, he has done nothing to raise much-needed spending on infrastructure. And despite its obvious indifference to budget deficits, his administration seems determined to deprive children of the adequate health care and nutrition they will need to become productive adults.
And there’s an important lesson for Democrats going beyond this election — namely, how to deal with what I’ve called the Very Serious People, centrists who spent years insisting that government debt was the most important issue of our time (and also believing, or pretending to believe, that Republicans were sincere in their supposed concern about debt).
The VSPs have gone oddly silent under Trump — funny how that works — but they’ll surely be back if Democrats retake the White House. But they have no idea what they’re talking about, and never did. If and when they reemerge, Democrats should ignore them.

David Leonhardt: Bernie Sanders is making a big mistake

Texto completo: The last four presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump — are four very different politicians. But they have one crucial similarity: They all tried to appeal to voters who weren’t obvious supporters.
Clinton promised a “third way,” distinct from traditional Democratic or Republican policies. Bush ran on compassionate conservatism. Obama said that red and blue America shared more in common than pundits claimed.
Even Trump, radical as he is, flouted Republican orthodoxy by sounding like a populist Democrat on Social Security, Medicare and trade. Polls showed that voters judged Trump to be more moderate than any Republican nominee since the 1970s.
The art of peeling off voters — those in the middle or those who aren’t ideological — may be the most important skill in politics. It doesn’t require a mushy centrist policy agenda, either. Trump has made that clear. So, in earlier eras, did Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
How? By understanding that politics is inescapably performative. Voters respond to signals. They respond to gestures of respect from politicians who are willing to say, in effect: We may not agree on everything, but I see you and understand what matters to you.
The newly energetic American left has largely rejected this approach, choosing instead to believe a comforting myth about swing voters being extinct and turnout being a cure-all. It’s a big mistake.
Before going further, I want to make clear that this is not a column urging Democrats to return to Clintonian centrism. I’m making a different case — that the left is hurting is own ability to win elections and enact sweeping change, by insisting on an orthodox version of progressivism.
To put it another way: Can you think of one way that Bernie Sanders is signaling respect to voters outside of his base?
He has taken a nearly maximalist liberal position on every major issue. It’s especially striking from him, because he has shown over his career that he grasps the importance of building a coalition.
Sanders once won over blue-collar Vermonters with help from a moderate position on guns. “We need a sensible debate about gun control which overcomes the cultural divide that exists in this country,” he said in 2015, “and I think I can play an important role in this.” He was also once an heir to organized labor’s skepticism of large-scale immigration. “At a time when the middle class is shrinking, the last thing we need is to bring over in a period of years, millions of people into this country who are prepared to lower wages for American workers,” he said in 2007.
Now, though, Sanders has evidently decided that progressives will no longer accept impurities — or even much tactical vagueness. He, along with Elizabeth Warren, has embraced policies that are popular on the left and nowhere else: a ban on fracking; the decriminalization of border crossings; the provision of federal health benefits to unauthorized immigrants; the elimination of private health insurance.
For many progressives, each of these issues has become a moral litmus test. Any restriction of immigration is considered a denial of human rights. Any compromise on guns or health care is an acceptance of preventable deaths.
And I understand the progressive arguments on these issues. But turning every compromise into an existential moral failing is not a smart way to practice politics. It comforts the persuaded while alienating the persuadable.
FDR and Reagan understood this, as did Abraham Lincoln and many great social reformers, including Frederick Douglass, Jane Addams, Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez. Strong political movements can accept impurity on individual issues in the service of a larger goal: winning.
The impurities will still produce bitter complaints, of course. FDR and Reagan were both lambasted by their allies at times. But few of those allies abandoned them. Victory is an excellent balm.
Over the past few years, the progressive left has made impressive progress, elevating issues like the $15 minimum wage, expanded Medicare and free college. A central figure in the movement, Sanders, is now the favorite to win the Democratic nomination.
But progressives are still a very long way from achieving the changes they seek. Republicans control the Senate, and a conservative majority runs the Supreme Court. Trump has an excellent chance to win reelection and usher in a dark era for American progressivism.
Faced with the potential of either large gains or historic losses, progressives would be wise to stop believing only what they want to believe. Don’t cherry-pick polls to claim that most Americans actually favor a ban on private insurance. Don’t imagine that millions of heretofore silent progressive supporters will materialize on Election Day. In the 2018 midterms, Sanders-style candidates lost swing districts, while candidates demonstrating respect to swing voters won again and again.
Beating Trump in November will be even harder. And uncomfortable compromises will make it more likely.
For Sanders, that may mean walking back his position on fracking, which threatens his chances in must-win Pennsylvania. It could also mean repeating some of his earlier arguments about the need for border security and immigration restrictions. Many working-class voters, including people of color, agree with that.
Sanders is not an ideal Democratic nominee. But he does have some big strengths. One of them is the passionate support he inspires, which gives him an opportunity to reach out to new voters while holding on to his base.

Texto completo: The coronavirus almost certainly will begin spreading in communities in the United States, and Americans should begin preparations now, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.
“It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a news briefing.
The news caps weeks of fear that the coronavirus spreading from China may become a pandemic, disrupting the global economy and political landscape in ways that are difficult to forecast.
Iran, South Korea and Italy are now grappling with clusters of infection, even as the epidemic in China’s Hubei province seems to be slowing. In the United States, stocks tumbled Monday as the dimensions of the outbreak became clearer.
These new hubs underscored the lack of a coordinated global strategy to combat the coronavirus, which has infected nearly 80,000 people in 37 countries, causing at least 2,600 deaths.
Officials at the CDC said they did not know whether the spread of the disease to the United States would be mild or severe. But Americans should be ready for a significant disruption to their daily lives, she added.

“We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad,” Messonnier said.
In Washington, the secretary of health and human services told a Senate panel that federal and local health departments will need as many as 300 million masks for health care workers and additional ventilators for hospitals to prepare for an outbreak of coronavirus in the U.S.
“This is an unprecedented potentially severe health challenge globally,” Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, told a Senate subcommittee.
But lawmakers from both parties made it clear they were unconvinced the Trump administration was prepared for the outbreak that the CDC is forecasting.
As Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., pressed for an exact number of people expected to be infected, the acting secretary of the Homeland Security Department, Chad Wolf, could not answer.
“I’m all for committees and task forces, but you’re the secretary,” Kennedy responded. “I think you ought to know that answer.”
Trump administration officials overseeing the response to a potential coronavirus outbreak told lawmakers that the initial amount of money requested by the White House — $1.25 billion in new funds and $1.25 billion taken from other programs — would likely be just a first round.
“We’re really learning day by day and week by week of the contours of this disease,” Azar said.
Lawmakers listening to Azar’s requests appeared startled.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., asked the health secretary whether he thought the United States currently had enough health masks in stock.
“Of course not,” he responded, “or else we wouldn’t be asking for more.”
Azar said that officials currently had 30 million N95 masks in the nation’s emergency stockpile, which typically cost less than $1.
Azar said he was alarmed by the human-to-human transmission of the virus in other parts of the world without an identifiable connection to confirmed cases and what that could mean for how the virus may hit the United States in the coming months.
“We cannot hermetically seal off the United States to a virus,” Azar said. “And we need to be realistic about that.”
The World Health Organization said that the pace of confirmed new cases in China, which exceeded 2,000 a day a month ago, had dropped steadily, to a low of 508 on Monday.

The WHO said the severe measures imposed by Chinese authorities to isolate patients and the hardest-hit areas had likely prevented hundreds of thousands of additional infections.
But WHO officials have also warned that the world is unprepared for a leap in infections, which could overwhelm medical resources in many countries. They also cautioned that new cases could suddenly resurge in China, as the government struggles to get people back to work.
And there are persistent doubts about the accuracy of infection figures reported by China’s government, raising the possibility that the true magnitude of the outbreak remains underreported.
By Tuesday, South Korea had reported a total of 893 cases, the second most in the world, and the Centers for Disease Control in the United States warned Americans not to travel there.
Of the 60 new cases reported by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 49 came from Daegu, the city at the center of the outbreak in that country.
In Iran, a spike in coronavirus infections — including the top health official in charge of fighting the disease — has prompted fears of a contagion throughout the Middle East.
In Italy, one of Europe’s largest economies, officials are struggling to prevent the epidemic from paralyzing the commercial center of Milan. And in New York, London and Tokyo, financial markets plummeted Monday and Tuesday on fears that the virus will cripple the global economy.
Messonnier said that she had sat down with her children and told them, “we as a family need to preparing for significant disruption of our lives.”
Americans “should ask their schools about plans for dismissal” and for conducting classes online in the event that the spread of illness becomes serious, she said.
“I contacted my local school superintendent this morning with exactly those questions.”

Maureen Dowd: Trump should admire a movie about con artists who wreak chaos

Texto completo: Washington • It’s funny that Donald Trump doesn’t like a movie about con artists who invade an elegant house and wreak chaos.
He should empathize with parasites.
No doubt the president is a movie buff. He has been known to call advisers in the wee hours to plan movie nights at the White House for films he wants to see, like “Joker.” And, in an early sign of his affinity for tyrants, he told Playboy in 1990 that his role model was Louis B. Mayer running MGM in the ’30s.
Trump interrupted his usual rally rant Thursday night to bash the Oscars, saying: “And the winner is a movie from South Korea. What the hell was that all about? We got enough problems with South Korea with trade. On top of it, they give them the best movie of the year?”
He added: “Can we get ‘Gone With the Wind’ back, please? ‘Sunset Boulevard.’ So many great movies. The winner is from South Korea. I thought it was best foreign film, right? Best foreign movie. No. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He’s a little wise guy.” (When he accepted his Oscar, Pitt complained that the Senate did not let John Bolton testify.)
Our president is nostalgic for a movie romanticizing slavery and a movie about an aging diva swanning maniacally around a mansion, living in a vanished past. ( I am big. It’s the party that got small. )
Trump’s xenophobic movie criticism, combined with his mocking pronunciation of the name “Buttigieg,” harked back to the days when George H.W. Bush ran in 1988 wrapped in the flag, saying he was on “the American side,” while his celebrity endorser Loretta Lynn complained that she couldn’t even pronounce the name Dukakis. Too foreign-sounding.
It also echoed a segment on Laura Ingraham’s show, in which it was suggested that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an American war hero who immigrated from Ukraine, might be guilty of espionage.
And in his Vegas rally on Friday, Trump was again calling his predecessor “Barack Hussein Obama.”
This was another bad, crazy week trapped in Trump’s psychopathology. No sooner was the president acquitted than he put scare quotes around the words justice and Justice Department and sought to rewrite the narrative of the Mueller report, whose author warned that Russia was going to try to meddle in the U.S. election again.
Philip Rucker wrote in The Washington Post: “As his reelection campaign intensifies, Trump is using the powers of his office to manipulate the facts and settle the score. Advisers say the president is determined to protect his associates ensnared in the expansive Russia investigation, punish the prosecutors and investigators he believes betrayed him, and convince the public that the probe was exactly as he sees it: an illegal witch hunt.”
Trump, who moved from a Fifth Avenue penthouse to the White House, is sinking deeper into his poor-little-me complex, convinced that he is being persecuted.
His darker sense of grievance converges with a neon grandiosity. Trump is totally uncontrolled now. Most presidents worry about the seaminess of pardons and wait until the end. Trump is going full throttle on pardoning his pals and pals of his pals in an election year.
The Republicans have shown they are too scared to stop him and won’t. The Democrats want to stop him but can’t. (Although if they win the Senate back, Democrats will probably end up impeaching him again and this time have plenty of witnesses.)
Now, in a frightening new twist, the president is angry at his own intelligence team for trying to protect the national interest. He would rather hide actual intelligence from Congress than have Adam Schiff know something that Trump thinks would make him look bad politically.
As The Times reported, the president’s intelligence officials warned House lawmakers in a briefing that Russia was once more intent on trespassing on our election to help Trump, intent on interfering in both the Democratic primaries and the general. (They also told Bernie Sanders that the Russians were trying to help his campaign.)
News of the House briefing caused another Vesuvian eruption from the mercurial president, who is hypersensitive to any suggestion that he isn’t winning all on his own.
The Times story said that “the president berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place,” especially because his nemesis Schiff was present.
A few days ago, the president replaced Maguire as acting director with Richard Grenell, the sycophantic ambassador to Germany whose qualifications for overseeing the nation’s 17 spy agencies include being a former Fox News commentator and Trump superfan who boasts a gold-level card with the Trump Organization.
As the Democrats sputter and spat and fight over federal giveaways and NDAs, the unfettered president is overturning the rule of law and stuffing the agencies with toadies.
Nothing is in the national interest or public good. Everything is in the greater service of the Trump cult of personality.
In “Gone With the Wind,” Atlanta burned to the ground. In Trump’s version, Washington is aflame.

Michelle Goldberg: Putin would hate President Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: On Friday, The Washington Post reported that U.S. officials had briefed Bernie Sanders that Russia was trying to boost his fortunes in the Democratic primary fight, as it did in 2016. It’s not hard to imagine Vladimir Putin’s motives.
Russia aims to cause chaos and division in liberal democracies and so has often supported both far-right and far-left figures; there’s a reason state-run Russian propaganda network RT hosted the American Green Party’s 2016 presidential debate.
Further, Russia’s investment in Donald Trump has paid off handsomely, and the country’s leaders evidently believe, just as many American pundits do, that Sanders would be Trump’s weakest opponent. “If Sanders wins the Democratic nomination, then Trump wins the White House,” a former adviser to ex-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told GQ’s Julia Ioffe.
But Russia doesn’t have any special insight into how American elections are going to play out, and right now, some polls show Sanders winning both the primary and the general. Like a lot of nervous liberals, I worry that these numbers won’t hold up. But if they do and Sanders becomes president, Putin may live to regret what his country did to build support for him.
Unlike Trump, Sanders would not be a stooge for Russia. Almost any Democratic president would represent a victory over the authoritarian kleptocracy Putin has sought to export all over the world. But Sanders has gone further than several of his rivals in defining his foreign policy in opposition to plundering autocrats.
This is important to keep in mind, because when it comes to Russia, a lot of people have sought to draw invidious comparisons between Trump and Sanders. Anti-Trump conservative Evan McMullin tweeted, “Bernie Sanders is the Democrats’ Donald Trump. Kremlin-backed. Moscow sympathizing.”
The Trump administration is even pretending, outrageously, that Russia prefers Sanders to the president. In a demagogic appearance on ABC News this weekend, Trump’s national security adviser claimed that Russia had an interest in seeing Sanders prevail in 2020: “Well, there are these reports that they want Bernie Sanders to get elected president. That’s no surprise. He honeymooned in Moscow.”
It’s certainly true that at times Sanders has been embarrassingly credulous about communist regimes. But Russia hasn’t been communist in decades, and it is Trump, not Sanders, who fawns over Putin and other despots, including Stalinist madman Kim Jong Un. Sanders, by contrast, believes that American foreign policy should be oriented around expanding democracy in the face of what he called “a new authoritarian axis.”
“There is currently a struggle of enormous consequence taking place in the United States and throughout the world,” Sanders said in a 2018 speech. “In it we see two competing visions. On one hand, we see a growing worldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy and kleptocracy. On the other side, we see a movement toward strengthening democracy, egalitarianism and economic, social, racial and environmental justice.”
Sanders isn’t a militarist, but he’s no isolationist, either. “If he was in office, and he actually pursued that foreign policy, that would be much to the detriment of Vladimir Putin,” said Max Bergmann, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and an Elizabeth Warren supporter who considers himself a Russia hawk.
It’s ironic: Throughout his career, Sanders has repeatedly excoriated American foreign policy, refusing to accede to the myth of America’s fundamental innocence. But in a race with Trump, he would represent American exceptionalism. “As the wealthiest and most powerful nation on Earth, we have got to help lead the struggle to defend and expand a rules-based international order in which law, not might, makes right,” he said in 2017.
Putin, of course, is bent on subverting the rules-based international order. By most accounts, he’s less interested in cultivating faith in his own system than in destroying belief in alternatives. He aims to paint liberal democracy as nothing but an empty slogan papering over zero-sum contests for power.
In this project, Trump couldn’t better serve Putin’s interests if he were a conscious Russian asset. Under Trump, the U.S. has abandoned the pretense of backing democracy and human rights, meaning there are no longer any great powers that even pretend to put morality at the center of foreign affairs. The horror of this era isn’t just the emergence of an axis of authoritarianism, but the fact that there are so few allies to counter it.
If Sanders was elected president, that could change. His unlikely ascendance would be a blow against the corrosive cynicism in which authoritarianism thrives. America would be the country where young people of all races powered a campaign that proved stronger than plutocracy, stronger than nationalist demagogy, stronger than any of the tools that men like Putin have used to bring liberalism to its knees. To young idealists around the world, America would look — dare I say it — great again.
Building a multiracial social democracy is one of the great political challenges of our time. Few nations on Earth have figured out how to create, in heterogenous populations, the solidarity needed to sustain a robust public sphere. Putin has exploited this difficulty, stoking tribal fears in countries with changing demographics to make liberalism look like a form of social dissolution.
If enough Americans unite across racial lines to replace Trump with a Jewish socialist, it might mean that our country is figuring out how to transcend the illiberalism of our age. I still find it difficult to believe that Sanders can pull it off. But if he does, Putin won’t be pleased for long.

PBS show ‘Finding Your Roots’ genealogist Johni Cerny dies at 76 in Utah

Texto completo: Johni Cerny, the chief genealogist for the PBS series “Finding Your Roots,” who helped some 200 famous people — among them Oprah Winfrey, Quincy Jones, Sen. Bernie Sanders and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — trace their ancestry, died Wednesday in Lehi. She was 76.
Deborah Christensen, Cerny’s partner of 23 years, said the cause was coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.
“Johni Cerny was the proverbial dean of American genealogical research,” Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard professor who is a host and executive producer of “Finding Your Roots,” said in a statement. In an email message Thursday, he described her work as “transforming raw data into narratives and metaphors about diversity and our common humanity.”
Cerny’s passion for the field began in childhood, for intensely personal reasons.
Jonnette Elaine Cerny was born August 27, 1943, in Kansas City, Missouri. Her mother was Vivian Elaine (West) Cerny, and the man she was told was her father was John Steve Cerny, a soldier in World War II who later worked in the heating and air-conditioning business. She was the oldest of five children.
The family later moved to Southern California. She enrolled at the University of Missouri but transferred to Brigham Young University, where she received a bachelor’s degree in social work and genealogical research in 1969.
She was always fascinated by family trees. Her maternal grandmother, Bertha Smith West, had been adopted and always wanted to learn the identity of her biological parents. Johni was 19 when she began that research, but it was not until long after her grandmother’s death in 1972 that she was able to use DNA — essentially a 21st-century genealogical tool — to find their names.
Meanwhile, Cerny had long suspected that John Cerny was not her biological father. It was not until 2018, however, that with the help of DNA she was able to identify the man who was: Charles Owen Williams.
According to Nick Sheedy, a researcher at Lineages, Johni Cerny’s family history and genealogical research company, he and Cerny signed up with “every database out there” and the process took about nine months.
Williams had died in 1960, but Johni Cerny soon met a whole new circle of relatives on her father’s side.

Cerny did not go into genealogical research immediately after college. From 1972 to 1979 she served in the Army, reaching the rank of captain. She returned to Utah because of its research resources, particularly the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ Family History Library.
She founded Lineages in 1983, before most computerized databases and long before $99 mail-order DNA reports. As a social media tribute to her observed, she spent a lot of time “looking through microfilm and toting bags of quarters for the copy machines.”
Cerny was an editor and author of “The Source: A Guidebook of American Genealogy” (1984) and “The Library: A Guide to the LDS Family History Library” (1986). A favorite research subject of hers was Germanna, the Virginia settlement of Germans who in 1718 were tricked into indentured servitude. She and Gary J. Zimmerman published several “Before Germanna” books, including histories of the Baumgartner, Dieter, Moyer and Willheit families.
She began working on PBS projects with Gates in 2006 as a researcher on “African American Lives,” which Virginia Heffernan, in a review in The New York Times, called “the most exciting and stirring documentary on any subject to appear on television in a long time.” Cerny also worked on “Faces of America” (2010) and “The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross” (2013).
From 2012 through 2019, she was the chief researcher for “Finding Your Roots.” Her subjects on that series also included Stephen Colbert, Larry David, Queen Latifah, Rep. John Lewis, Meryl Streep and Tina Turner.
Cerny was never one to pinpoint a favorite project, associates said, but in a 2019 interview she mentioned an episode with comedian Sarah Silverman.
“Her comment just took the words right out of my mouth,” Cerny said. “She was looking at a photograph of family members she had never seen before. And she just said, ‘I wish I could crawl into this picture and know what’s going on in there.’”
In addition to Christensen, a psychologist, Cerny is survived by a brother, Jack Cerny, and three sisters, Antoinette Greenstone, Nanette Muirhead and Stevette Shinkle. She helped raise Christensen’s sons, Tim, Matthew and Jake, and her daughters, Anna Ward and Rachel Stowe. There are 11 grandchildren.
There was little doubt that Cerny loved her career. In a 2019 video, she admitted to a workday that began around 7:30 a.m. and ended at about 6:30 p.m. — and to a habit of waking up in the middle of the night with an idea and going straight to her computer. Her work, she said, was “very addictive.”

Texto completo: Tras una primera parte llena de ataques llegó al décimo debate demócrata una postura común sobre el control de armas . Incluso dos candidatos en principio opuestos como son Bernie Sanders y Mike Blomberg coincidieron en la idea de imponer revisiones más estrictas a la compra y posesión de armas.
Este tema había sido precisamente uno con los que la campaña del milmillonario Bloomberg atacó al senador de Vermont en un video lanzado este lunes. El también exalcalde de Nueva York acusaba el llamado socialista democrático de haber recibido en los noventa el respaldo de la Asociación Nacional del Rifle (NRA), algo que el equipo de Sanders y él mismo han negado.
Durante el debate, Biden también le recriminó al senador sus votos en el pasado sobre el uso y control de armas.
El senador, que según estudios de The New York Times llega al debate con el 28% de apoyos, fue más contundente en este debate al asegurar que “el momento es ahora” para “ser más agresivos en el control sobre el uso de armas” debido a esos “desagradables y espantosos tiroteos masivos”.
El multimillonario Tom Steyer estuvo de acuerdo con su rival y añadió que “ necesitamos cambiar el Senado , […] necesitamos una gran victoria” para poder legislar en esta materia.

Texto completo: Después de una cooperación en crecimiento con policías locales y estatales, la oficina de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) ha bajado su solicitud de retención de inmigrantes indocumentados.
Tras la llegada el presidente Donald Trump , aumentaron los condados y ciudades santuario en entidades como California, Nueva York, Nueva Jersey e Illinois, lo que limitó la cooperación de autoridades locales con agentes migratorios, lo cual se refleja en las cifras de solicitudes.
En el año fiscal 2019, la agencia pidió su cooperación a 3,671 oficinas policiacas en 50 estados, lo que supuso un ligero descenso con el periodo anterior.
Esas órdenes, que requieren que las policías locales, estatales y federales retengan a individuos bajo su custodia por 72 horas a fin de que ICE tenga tiempo para arrestarlos e iniciar el proceso de deportación, se enviaron a agencias en 2,158 condados, según el Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), de la universidad en Syracuse, en Nueva York.
A pesar del gran número de agencias que recibieron esos pedidos, el uso de las órdenes de retención por parte de ICE disminuyó en el período fiscal 2019, con unos 165,768 trámites, comparado con los 177,295 en el período fiscal 2018 .
La recepción de un pedido para la agencia local entregar a ICE alguien bajo su custodia “fue un acontecimiento relativamente inusitado para la mayoría de las agencias locales”.
“El 34 % de estas agencias locales recibió tres o menos de tales pedidos durante todo el año pasado” , agregó. “Alrededor del 16 % de las agencias recibió una sola orden de retención”.
La agencia policial más apremiada por ICE en el período fiscal 2019 fue la Cárcel del Condado de Harris, en Texas, que recibió poco más de 5,000 órdenes de retención, seguida por la Cárcel del Condado de Maricopa, en Arizona, con 3,200; la Cárcel del Condado de Hidalgo, en Texas, con 2,800, y la Cárcel del Condado de Gwinnett, en Georgia, con 2,400.
“Tan solo el 9% de las agencias policiales locales recibió más de cien órdenes de retención de ICE en el período fiscal 2019, esto es un promedio de dos o más por semana” , señaló TRAC. “Y sólo ocho de estas agencias recibieron un promedio de cinco órdenes o más por día”.
El uso de estas órdenes se incrementó año tras año desde 2003 y alcanzó una cima de 309,697 en el año fiscal 2011, durante el primer mandato del presidente Barack Obama (2009-2017).
Posteriormente descendió paulatinamente hasta una sima de 85,720 peticiones en el período fiscal 2016, a partir de cuando, ya con Trump como Presidente, comenzó a subir hasta 2018.
Los “detainers” se han convertido en una de las principales disputas entre la Administración Trump y las jurisdicciones “santuario” , aquellas que rechazan colaborar en la aplicación de las leyes migratorias, de competencia exclusiva del Gobierno federal.
En uno de los últimos capítulos en esa batalla, ICE ha conminado recientemente el cumplimiento de esas peticiones de retención y ha requerido información sobre migrantes que han sido juzgados, condenados y sentenciados por crímenes.
En lo que va de año, ICE ha enviado citaciones de inmigración a autoridades locales en Oregon, California, Colorado, Connecticut y Nueva York para que les envíen información sobre migrantes indocumentados que, en su opinión, representan “amenazas a la seguridad pública” con el objetivo de transferirlos a sus instalaciones antes de que sean liberados para así poder deportarlos.
Estas citaciones llegan en unas semanas en las que el Gobierno Trump también indicó que enviaría a tropas de élite de la Patrulla Fronteriza a ciudades santuario de todo el país donde las jurisdicciones locales obstaculizan sus planes de deportación.
Aunque no se informó de qué ciudades se trata, The New York Times, que citó a dos funcionarios que conocen el operativo, adelantó que son Nueva York, San Francisco, Los Ángeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, Nueva Orleans, Detroit y Newark (Nueva Jersey).

Texto completo: Después de una cooperación en crecimiento con policías locales y estatales, la oficina de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) ha bajado su solicitud de retención de inmigrantes indocumentados.
Tras la llegada el presidente Donald Trump , aumentaron los condados y ciudades santuario en entidades como California, Nueva York, Nueva Jersey e Illinois, lo que limitó la cooperación de autoridades locales con agentes migratorios, lo cual se refleja en las cifras de solicitudes.
En el año fiscal 2019, la agencia pidió su cooperación a 3,671 oficinas policiacas en 50 estados, lo que supuso un ligero descenso con el periodo anterior.
Esas órdenes, que requieren que las policías locales, estatales y federales retengan a individuos bajo su custodia por 72 horas a fin de que ICE tenga tiempo para arrestarlos e iniciar el proceso de deportación, se enviaron a agencias en 2,158 condados, según el Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), de la universidad en Syracuse, en Nueva York.
A pesar del gran número de agencias que recibieron esos pedidos, el uso de las órdenes de retención por parte de ICE disminuyó en el período fiscal 2019, con unos 165,768 trámites, comparado con los 177,295 en el período fiscal 2018 .
La recepción de un pedido para la agencia local entregar a ICE alguien bajo su custodia “fue un acontecimiento relativamente inusitado para la mayoría de las agencias locales”.
“El 34 % de estas agencias locales recibió tres o menos de tales pedidos durante todo el año pasado” , agregó. “Alrededor del 16 % de las agencias recibió una sola orden de retención”.
La agencia policial más apremiada por ICE en el período fiscal 2019 fue la Cárcel del Condado de Harris, en Texas, que recibió poco más de 5,000 órdenes de retención, seguida por la Cárcel del Condado de Maricopa, en Arizona, con 3,200; la Cárcel del Condado de Hidalgo, en Texas, con 2,800, y la Cárcel del Condado de Gwinnett, en Georgia, con 2,400.
“Tan solo el 9% de las agencias policiales locales recibió más de cien órdenes de retención de ICE en el período fiscal 2019, esto es un promedio de dos o más por semana” , señaló TRAC. “Y sólo ocho de estas agencias recibieron un promedio de cinco órdenes o más por día”.
El uso de estas órdenes se incrementó año tras año desde 2003 y alcanzó una cima de 309,697 en el año fiscal 2011, durante el primer mandato del presidente Barack Obama (2009-2017).
Posteriormente descendió paulatinamente hasta una sima de 85,720 peticiones en el período fiscal 2016, a partir de cuando, ya con Trump como Presidente, comenzó a subir hasta 2018.
Los “detainers” se han convertido en una de las principales disputas entre la Administración Trump y las jurisdicciones “santuario” , aquellas que rechazan colaborar en la aplicación de las leyes migratorias, de competencia exclusiva del Gobierno federal.
En uno de los últimos capítulos en esa batalla, ICE ha conminado recientemente el cumplimiento de esas peticiones de retención y ha requerido información sobre migrantes que han sido juzgados, condenados y sentenciados por crímenes.
En lo que va de año, ICE ha enviado citaciones de inmigración a autoridades locales en Oregon, California, Colorado, Connecticut y Nueva York para que les envíen información sobre migrantes indocumentados que, en su opinión, representan “amenazas a la seguridad pública” con el objetivo de transferirlos a sus instalaciones antes de que sean liberados para así poder deportarlos.
Estas citaciones llegan en unas semanas en las que el Gobierno Trump también indicó que enviaría a tropas de élite de la Patrulla Fronteriza a ciudades santuario de todo el país donde las jurisdicciones locales obstaculizan sus planes de deportación.
Aunque no se informó de qué ciudades se trata, The New York Times, que citó a dos funcionarios que conocen el operativo, adelantó que son Nueva York, San Francisco, Los Ángeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, Nueva Orleans, Detroit y Newark (Nueva Jersey).

R. Eric Thomas is here with his book

Texto completo: At the Baltimore library that R. Eric Thomas frequented growing up, the maximum number of books he was allowed to check out was 40. With each visit, he checked out 40. And the books that were too advanced for his age, "I made my grandparents read them to me."
Thomas, now 38, went on to become a daily humor columnist for Elle magazine, where he delivers hot takes on topics like Elizabeth Warren's "withering glares" at Michael Bloomberg and witty Project Runway recaps. Now back in Baltimore after living in Philadelphia for more than 15 years, he's also written for the New York Times, W Magazine, Marie Claire, and others.
In Philly, he's known as the longtime host of the Moth StorySLAM, and as the rising-star playwright whose Time Is On Our Side won the 2016 Barrymore Award for best new play locally. Thomas also won the prestigious national Lanford Wilson Award that year, honoring an early-career playwright.
Now Thomas is a book author, too. And he's bringing his debut memoir-in-essays, Here for It: Or, How to Save Your Soul in America, to the Free Library on Thursday, where he'll talk about what it means to be an "other."
"I wanted to write a story where someone who is a minority in many ways could still be at the center of their own narrative," he said. "And I wanted to use humor to do that. . . . Sugar helps the medicine go down."
The Inquirer spoke to Thomas before his visit about writing daily columns, the importance of voice, and what he describes as the "Huxtable scale of blackness."
This interview has been edited and condensed.
What made you want to write the book as a series of essays?
I was less interested in telling one, long, memoiristic story. With memoirs, there's sorta a sneaky suspicion that you have to have had this extraordinary life for a memoir to be worthy and I don't think that's true, but I think it's hard to push back on.
When I first started this, my feeling was that I haven't climbed a mountain, I didn't survive the wreck of the Titanic, so why should I write a memoir? Now I'm on the other side of it and I think everyone should write a memoir. A memoir is literally just a recollection of life.
How is writing for a digital audience different from writing a book?
One difference is the immediacy. I first put words on paper for what I knew would be this book over two years ago. It's really hard to write into the future, to imagine what world we'll be in, who's going to read this, and what space they'll be in. With a digital audience, it's all immediacy.
One of the things that changed my life - the books that opened up new universes for me - I found in libraries that had been printed decades earlier. If I'm lucky, there will be people in 20 years, some high school student, some senior citizen, some mom looking for a laugh, who will pick up this book.
In the book, you talk about the "Huxtable scale of blackness," where you said you identified most with Vanessa. Could you explain that?
The Huxtables remain a really tough thing in our culture because of where they came from. The creator is a criminal and a controversial figure. But these characters were a part of a black family that was both stereotypical and also very unique, where each member of the family, as is often the case in sitcoms, had a very distinct personality. They were all different shades of blackness, but they also had different relationships to the expression of their blackness.
A character like Denise was more militant and more on the "woke" scale. A character like Vanessa was less in tune with some of the more advocacy-minded aspects of blackness and really more focused on socialness. Characters like Theo and Sandra and Rudy sort of fall in between.
And so when I talked about blackness, I talked about feeling like Vanessa, like a black person but not always as in tune as I wanted to be with the deepest, most socially progressive parts of what a black experience can be.
You write about the possible implicit bias in the Dewey Decimal System. How did you come to that realization?
I always thought of the Dewey Decimal System as empirical measurements or definitions of where books go. When I was doing research for the essay, "She's got herself a universe," I wanted to go back and look at the call numbers to find books about gay or queer life. I tried to figure out where these call numbers came from and who assigns them.
Because the system requires some human to categorize a book, it's possible for the categorization to reflect implicit bias. As I dug deeper into that, I discovered that there was a librarian from Howard University, who actually had created her own system in the 1930s to counteract that. [Among other things, librarian Dorothy Porter moved black scholars out of the segregating 325 Dewey classification and into subject areas alongside white authors.] And that was really empowering and I wanted to include it in the essay.
It's clear that you have a very distinct writing voice. How do you ensure that your writing still sounds like you after multiple rounds of edits?
I have a really phenomenal editorial team that gives incredible notes on structure and intention. My default is to put 9,000 jokes per page and so a lot of the time, the note was, "You don't need this many jokes. Pull it back by 30 percent or by half."
There are times when you have to adjust the volume of your voice a little bit. I ask myself, "Is this note about the volume, or is this note about the voice." If it's about the voice, it's not a note that I can take. If it's about the volume, that's something that I totally get.
Finish this sentence. I'm most happy when . . .
. . . I'm eating.
I'm inspired by . . .
. . . Toni Morrison.
The lesson that's taken the longest to learn is . . .
. . . Loving myself fully.
I'm most proud of . . .
. . . Loving myself fully.

[Among other things, librarian Dorothy Porter moved black scholars out of the segregating 325 Dewey classification and into subject areas alongside white authors.] And that was really empowering and I wanted to include it in the essay.
It's clear that you have a very distinct writing voice. How do you ensure that your writing still sounds like you after multiple rounds of edits?
I have a really phenomenal editorial team that gives incredible notes on structure and intention. My default is to put 9,000 jokes per page and so a lot of the time, the note was, "You don't need this many jokes. Pull it back by 30 percent or by half."
There are times when you have to adjust the volume of your voice a little bit. I ask myself, "Is this note about the volume, or is this note about the voice." If it's about the voice, it's not a note that I can take. If it's about the volume, that's something that I totally get.
Finish this sentence. I'm most happy when . . .
. . . I'm eating.
I'm inspired by . . .
. . . Toni Morrison.
The lesson that's taken the longest to learn is . . .
. . . Loving myself fully.
I'm most proud of . . .
. . . Loving myself fully.

Texto completo: FORT MYERS, Fla. — Leaders of the Major League Baseball Players Association met with Red Sox players and coaches for approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes Tuesday morning, and while such meetings are held with all 30 teams during spring training, the context for this one was slightly different.
Much of the conversation between MLBPA officials and the Red Sox focused on questions related to sign-stealing and the investigation.
MLBPA executive director Tony Clark said the league has finished its interviews, leaving everyone to await the findings, which will not be finished this week, according to an industry source.
“As of right now, we understand that the interviews that they were going to have and did have as well as the information they were gathering from beyond the player interviews has all happened," said Clark. “Now we're just waiting for the decision itself."
While manager Ron Roenicke said Tuesday that the Red Sox look forward to having the investigation behind the team, Clark suggested that the players have accepted the nature of the deliberate process.
“I think they understand the process," said Clark. “Obviously everybody is looking forward to the 2020 season and would like to put this behind them."
Clark said that players are clearly interested in the question of fairness moving forward. As such, he expects new regulations regarding sign stealing and the in-game use of technology by Opening Day — and he said players and the MLBPA are open in the future to punishing players who violate such rules. (Both Astros and Red Sox players were granted immunity in MLB's investigations in return for testimony.)
Clark touched on several other topics:
■  He questioned the Red Sox' rationale for trading Mookie Betts.
“Boston made whatever decision they made for whatever reason they made it," said Clark. “I think that a face of our game, someone that should be more a face of our game, being put in that position, I don't think it was necessary.
“I know they've offered some commentary publicly, but you'd have to ask Boston as to why that's the case. We simply believe that Mookie is a generational talent. And the idea that he is no longer here is one that we just didn't believe was necessary."
■  He believes that teams are treating the luxury tax threshold ($208 million in 2020) as an excuse to cap payroll in a way that wasn't anticipated when the current collective bargaining agreement was negotiated, and vowed that there would be changes to the luxury tax before the next agreement.
“We think there are a number of aspects in our CBA that need to be addressed," he said. “If the competitive balance tax is being used in the fashion that it's being used and the excuse that it's being used for, then it's something we're going to look at.
“The assumptions that we made were predicated on what it was that teams had been doing in the past. What we've seen, though, is a dramatic change and shift in how those teams are functioning against the backdrop of how they may have functioned five or 10 years ago. As a result, we're going to need to modernize the system to reflect the changes that we're seeing."
■  He suggested that the erupting sign-stealing scandal is an outgrowth of an industry that is awash in technology and the hunt for inefficiencies and competitive advantage but hasn't taken the time to think through all of the implications of rapid change.
“We believe it's a product of the culture, top-down, in a number of organizations," said Clark. “I've said that, and I will continue to say that, despite what it is that was in the opinion — while recognizing that nobody is looking to suggest that players weren't a part of the process.
“The culture that exists is one that, with technology being left unchecked, is manifesting itself on and off the field in ways that aren't beneficial to the game."
■  While MLB and the MLBPA opened the door to a reconsideration of the game's economic foundation a year ago — a rare offer in the middle of a CBA — Clark said there “was dialogue, [but] not much in the way of progress" from those conversations.
“The lines of communication are still open," he added.

FAA Proposes Safety Fix for Another 737 MAX Production Lapse; Boeing says proposal isn't expected to affect mid-2020 return for the grounded jets

Texto completo: The Federal Aviation Administration is mandating a new round of safety fixes before Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX jets can return to the air, this time targeting assembly-line lapses that could result in dual-engine power loss in the event of a lightning strike.
The proposed directive, posted Tuesday on the Federal Register's website, would require inspecting and fixing a metallic lining that serves as a shield against lightning strikes for engine-control wiring. The FAA said cuts or tears in that aluminum-foil layer, located inside panels that cover engine attachments on the wings, could cause simultaneous loss of thrust in both engines.
The document immediately covers 128 737 MAX jets registered in the U.S., but the FAA said it is applicable to all MAX aircraft assembled so far because the entire fleet "may be affected by the identified unsafe condition."
A Boeing spokesman said the lightning-protection issues aren't expected to affect anticipated initial return of the planes around mid-2020. The FAA said it could take an estimated 12 hours of work for mechanics to check and repair the problem on each plane.
The move Tuesday comes after Boeing informed FAA officials that separate inspections have revealed more than two-thirds of undelivered MAX planes have some type of debris in their fuel tanks .
The FAA also is leaning toward requiring Boeing to relocate certain wiring bundles, some of which are located behind the cockpit and under the cabin floor, due to concerns that an electrical short circuit could result in potentially catastrophic flight-control difficulties that pilots would be unable to correct.
Roughly 700 MAX jets are grounded world-wide as Boeing, the FAA and international aviation regulators devise software fixes and revised pilot-training requirements to enable them to return to service. The planes have been idled for nearly a year in the wake of two crashes that took 346 lives.
The hazard stemming from the damaged lightning-protection feature was first reported by the New York Times.
FAA officials recently have shifted part of their focus to delve into production shortcomings, after months working primarily to address design and pilot-training issues related to the MAX. The agency has said FAA inspectors will increase oversight of assembly-line practices after Boeing resumes MAX production.
The agency has said it intends to check the condition and safety compliance of each MAX airliner before permitting it to carry passengers, a change from past practice. Traditionally, the FAA has delegated such approvals to Boeing and intends to continue doing so for planes other than the MAX.
FAA chief Steve Dickson has publicly urged the Chicago plane maker to tighten its own quality-control checks and safety procedures related to assembly operations.
Boeing said Tuesday the lightning-strike vulnerability affects only MAX planes built between February 2018 and June 2019. But in its directive, the FAA expanded the scope of the inspections to cover all MAX aircraft, concluding the company's earlier voluntary service bulletin wasn't comprehensive enough. Boeing stopped assembling the MAX in December.

Authors acclaim hot-selling genre at NW Passages event Making the case for romance

Texto completo: Romance fiction authors Asa Bradley, Katee Robert, Rebecca Zanetti, and Lucy Gilmore discussed everything from odd fan interactions and common misconceptions about the genre to their individual inspirations and nailing down how to write the perfect romance scene at Monday night's Northwest Passages Galentine's Day event.
All Inland Northwest locals, the authors featured are prolific. Robert and Zanetti have had more than 50 books published. And each has a loyal following.
Robert and Zanetti have been featured on the New York Times and USA Today bestseller lists; both incidentally have also had fans get tattoos of their names.
Despite the loyal and sustaining audience, however, romance fiction has been widely derided and often ignored by critics. Robert explained the tendency in the literary community to dismiss romance fiction outright because "it's about kissing. Or 'Oh, it's just those lady porn books.'"
"But, it's not all about sex," Zanetti said. "That's a small part of it. Sure it's an important part, but it is in life, too."
Each of the authors said they have had to deal with a certain stigma that comes with writing romance, but now that their readers have created their own network of criticism, what they affectionately call "Romancelandia," they no longer worry so much about the opinions of outsiders.
"There are so many other things that get mansplained to me," Bradley said. "I don't have the energy."
A lot of that derision has come from the recent popularity of works like Stephanie Meyers' "Twilight" and E.L. James' "Fifty Shades of Grey" and their critical reception. However, the authors had very few negative thoughts to share about the role of those series in the romance fiction industry overall.
"Having the hindsight of about a decade now, I think they were instrumental in bringing a significant number of adult readers back to reading books," Robert said. "Is there problematic content? Yeah. But they have (brought) people back to reading."
Romance readers typically read eight to 10 books on average in a month.
"We're not competing with other authors," Zanetti said. "We're competing with Netflix."
"So, for better or worse," Robert said, "(considering) the original content of 'Fifty Shades of Twilight,' they have done something really good for our industry and, I would say, for our society as a whole."
In parting, each of the authors shared a little advice for aspiring romance fiction authors: "Read a lot," Gilmore said. "There are people that think it would be so easy to write, but  until you read it and love it, I don't think you can ever successfully write it."
"Then sit down and start writing," Zanetti said. "People get a lot of books and join workshops and go for long walks but they never quite sit down and actually start writing."
"Write a lot," Bradley said, also explaining that finding a group of writers who work at your level can be invaluable. She recommended joining a local National Writing Month group and finding an editor you can trust to maintain your voice.
"And then finish writing," Robert said. "That's the hard part."

Assange Tried to Warn Hillary Clinton About Naming of U.S. Sources, Lawyers Say; WikiLeaks founder's defense team says he called State Department before other websites published unredacted material

Texto completo: LONDON—Lawyers representing Julian Assange disputed the U.S. government's claim that he solicited classified material and recklessly endangered lives when he published it, on the second day of a hearing to determine whether the WikiLeaks founder should be extradited to the U.S. to stand trial.
His defense team on Tuesday said Mr. Assange, in fact, tried to warn then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that the names of U.S. intelligence sources WikiLeaks had kept secret were about to be published by other outlets online—but was rebuffed.
Mr. Assange, a 48-year-old Australian, is wanted in the U.S. on 18 charges of breaking espionage laws and conspiring to hack a military computer. The alleged offenses relate to the publication in 2010 and 2011 by WikiLeaks of a huge trove of classified material that painted a bleak picture of the American campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan and their aftermath.
A British judge is currently hearing evidence in proceedings that are due to last months . A final decision on whether to extradite Mr. Assange may not be made until next year, or even 2022, lawyers say, given the likelihood of appeal.
Mr. Assange denies the charges and is resisting extradition on multiple grounds. He has long defended WikiLeaks' publication of thousands of sensitive documents as legitimate journalism that serves the public interest. His case has sparked a broad debate about press freedom in the internet age.
Mr. Assange, dressed in a gray suit, followed proceedings from the dock. Family members, WikiLeaks colleagues and journalists packed the courtroom. Protesters outside the east London courthouse adjacent to the high-security prison where Mr. Assange is being held voiced their support for the WikiLeaks founder throughout Tuesday's hearing with placards and chants.
His defense team on Tuesday sought to counter the central tenets of the U.S. indictment—that he solicited classified material from former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning and helped her crack a password to obtain that material, and that publication of the diplomatic cables and military logs she provided endangered the lives of U.S. intelligence sources.
Each of those claims is false, said Mark Summers, a lawyer acting for Mr. Assange.
Evidence from Ms. Manning's 2013 court-martial showed she hadn't acted on any specific requests from Mr. Assange or WikiLeaks when passing on material, Mr. Summers said.
He didn't dispute that Mr. Assange had exchanged messages with Ms. Manning about cracking a password, but said that wasn't related to her disclosures to WikiLeaks as the U.S. indictment alleges. The material she provided was available to her without the need for unauthorized access and her disclosures predated those messages, he said.
Mr. Summers disputed the U.S. case that Mr. Assange's publication of classified materials without redaction on the WikiLeaks website exposed U.S. intelligence sources to grave and imminent risk of attack or arbitrary detention.
He said that, in fact, Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks partnered with established media organizations such as the New York Times "to understand and deal responsibly with these materials." The documents were redacted to conceal sensitive information before publication with U.S. government guidance, Mr. Summers said.
The material only appeared in its unredacted form online after a password enabling its decryption appeared in a book by a British newspaper reporter, Mr. Summers said. That allowed websites unaffiliated with WikiLeaks to publish the raw material.
When in 2011 Mr. Assange realized this was about to happen, Mr. Summers said, he phoned the State Department in an attempt to warn the U.S. authorities. He was told to call back later, Mr. Summers said.
Mr. Summers said the U.S. government is misrepresenting the public record in its indictment requesting Mr. Assange's extradition. Mr. Assange could face a maximum prison sentence of 175 years if he is extradited to the U.S. and convicted on all counts, though the U.S. says sentences in similar cases have been much shorter.
"Is the request a fair, accurate and proper description of what is known to the U.S. government? The answer, glaringly, is no," Mr. Summers said.

Texto completo: South Carolina is a make-or-break state for former Vice President Joe Biden, who was the national Democratic primary front-runner for much of 2019 but who has watched Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont rack up a delegate lead after the first three contests. Because the state doesn't permit early voting, Tuesday night's debate could significantly influence people who are still making up their minds ahead of Saturday's voting.
Besides Messrs. Biden and Sanders, on stage will be former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and billionaire activist Tom Steyer.
The debate is set to start at 8 p.m. ET and is expected to run about two hours. It will air on CBS and also stream on CBSN.
Here's what we'll be watching:
Will Sanders finally have a target on his back?
Mr. Sanders, fresh off a decisive win in the Nevada caucuses Saturday, is the indisputable leader of the Democratic presidential field. This is likely to be the debate where the others in the race treat him as such.
This debate will have to be about "one candidate" who is "on pace to amass an insurmountable delegate lead," Dan Kanninen, states director for Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, told reporters on Monday.
Even Mr. Sanders's aides have expressed surprise that his opponents haven't gone after him harder in the nine previous debates, including in Las Vegas last week , where new participant Mr. Bloomberg took most of the incoming fire.
Mr. Buttigieg, who did well in Iowa and New Hampshire but struggled with Nevada's more diverse electorate, gave a fiery speech on Saturday urging Democrats to "take a sober look" at the party's general-election chances if the Vermont senator, who identifies as a democratic socialist, is at the top of the ticket.

"Sen. Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans," the former mayor said.
South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn said Sunday on ABC's "This Week" that Mr. Sanders as the nominee would be "a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in."
And Mr. Bloomberg's campaign is promoting a digital ad against Mr. Sanders that details the National Rifle Association's past support for him.
Watch for candidates to make those arguments—and sharply question how Mr. Sanders would pay for some of his top initiatives, such as Medicare for All, on the Charleston stage.
It isn't clear what a late-stage pummeling of Mr. Sanders on national television could mean for his chances—he is leading the field in national polls and surveys of several coming states. One exception is South Carolina, where Mr. Biden is outperforming him.
How will Bloomberg handle a rematch with Warren?
After the Massachusetts senator's pummeling of Mr. Bloomberg last week in what was the most-watched debate of the primary, viewers may tune in to see what happens between the two in Charleston.
Ms. Warren ripped the former New York mayor for his commentary about women's appearances over the years, directly comparing him with President Trump, and for reaching nondisclosure agreements with former employees who filed lawsuits against Bloomberg LP. Mr. Bloomberg, making his first debate appearance, stumbled over his answers and at one point rolled his eyes at Ms. Warren, though he later said that he was releasing three former employees from their NDAs.
He has been off the campaign trail preparing for the next debate for days and is hoping to better defend himself in Charleston.
The antipathy between the two is nearly a decade in the making. Mr. Bloomberg endorsed and raised money for Ms. Warren's opponent, Republican incumbent Sen. Scott Brown, in the 2012 Massachusetts Senate race, saying he appreciated Mr. Brown's decisive vote against a congressional right-to-carry gun bill. At the time, it was also clear that the billionaire businessman hard-wired to Wall Street wasn't a fan of the woman who had spent years pursuing tighter restrictions on the financial services industry.
"You can question, in my mind, whether she's God's gift to regulation, close the banks and get rid of corporate profits, and we'd all bring socialism back, or the U.S.S.R.," Mr. Bloomberg said of Ms. Warren in an October 2012 interview with the New York Times.
Ms. Warren's team believes her performance helped her with Nevadans who caucused after the debate, so she might be looking for another fight.
Can Biden finish strong in his 'firewall' state?
Mr. Biden has staked his presidential bid on what happens in South Carolina, where he draws strong support from the state's large bloc of black voters. Mr. Biden bombed in Iowa and New Hampshire and placed a distant second to Mr. Sanders in Nevada.
The former vice president and his campaign strategists have pleaded with donors and supporters to hang on until South Carolina, where they expect to win. Mr. Biden will be looking to use the debate to close the deal with South Carolina voters and revive his campaign. As he has in the past, he will likely emphasize his relationship with President Obama, one key factor in his popularity with black voters.
But a weak debate performance could prompt more black voters to look elsewhere. A recent Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll included troubling signs for Mr. Biden, showing that nationally, black voters are beginning to peel away from him.
Which moderate will emerge on top?
Messrs. Biden, Buttigieg and Bloomberg and Ms. Klobuchar have tried to present themselves as more-electable alternatives to Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, who both back more-liberal policies like Medicare for All.
Yet Democratic strategists have been increasingly vocal about concerns that there are too many moderate candidates and no clarity as to who is best positioned to face Mr. Sanders in a two-person race.
Obvious animosity between Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg in the Nevada debate made for great TV. Now, all four will be trying to demonstrate they can consolidate centrist support and take on Mr. Sanders before he amasses an insurmountable delegate lead.
What will the other billionaire do?
Mr. Steyer largely disappeared from the Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada contests while he focused on South Carolina, where state polls show he has been making progress.
He hopes to use the Tuesday debate to make a closing case to South Carolina voters. But he will be in an awkward position: Mr. Steyer supports liberal policies to tax wealthy Americans, but he may have to defend using his own money to further his presidential aspirations, as Mr. Bloomberg is doing.

Texto completo: Q: In the early '60s there was a comic book called "Katy Keene." Is that where the TV show got started?
A: The CW series is a spinoff of "Riverdale," which reimagines Archie Comics characters. And "Katy Keene," according to the network, "follows the lives and loves of four iconic Archie Comics characters - fashion legend-to-be Katy Keene (Lucy Hale), singer/songwriter Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), performer Jorge Lopez/Ginger (Jonny Beauchamp), and "It Girl" Pepper Smith (Julia Chan) - as they chase their 20-something dreams in New York City together."
The comic book Keene, which was introduced in 1945, has also been seen as an inspiration for fashion choices by singer Katy Perry. BuzzFeed offered a detailed comparison of images of the two Katys in 2014, but Perry told Rolling Stone that any suggestion she had copied the comic was "crazy."

Q: Could you let me know what happened to Harve Presnell, who was in the movie "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" with Debbie Reynolds? He has this great voice but I cannot find any other movies that he made.
A: As his entry on the Internet Movie Database makes clear, Presnell worked often. Stage credits include Broadway versions of "Molly Brown" and "Annie." He sang in the movie "Paint Your Wagon," with the Los Angeles Times, saying that "his rendition of 'They Call the Wind Mariah' was singled out by critics as the lone highlight in an otherwise disastrous film." Another memorable screen appearance was as Wade Gustafson, the father-in-law of William H. Macy's character in "Fargo." And on TV he was in "Dawson's Creek," "The Pretender" and other shows. He was 75 when he died of pancreatic cancer in 2009.

Q: This might be before your time, but what happened to the show "Adventures in Paradise"? The actor was named Adam Troy, I think.
A: Adam Troy was the character played by Gardner McKay (1932-2001) on the drama, which first aired on ABC for three seasons in 1959-62. McKay's character was "the captain of a freelance schooner plying the South Pacific in search of passengers, cargo and adventure," according to "The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows." James A. Michener created the series.
One article noted that McKay became a "TV heartthrob" through the show, but he did not long for that sort of celebrity. As The New York Times said in McKay's obituary, he basically abandoned acting after "Paradise" ended to focus on travel and writing, the latter including plays and novels.

Q: What can you tell me about a show called "Have Gun - Will Travel"? The actor's name was Boone.
A: That was Richard Boone who starred as the erudite, dapper gun-for-hire Paladin in the CBS Western that first aired in 1957. It was among the five most popular shows in prime-time for most of its run, and much of the credit goes to Boone. According to "Total Television," he directed several episodes and had both script and casting approval. Writers on the show included Gene Roddenberry, later famous as creator of the original "Star Trek." Guitarist Duane Eddy even managed a Top-40 hit with his version of the theme song.

Q: I love the show "Pitbulls and Parolees," but there used to be another show about saving pit bulls. The man who saved them was a little person who had been in prison at one time. It hasn't been on for a long time so it probably won't be returning, but I would love to know what he is doing.
A: The show you remember is "Pit Boss," which aired on Animal Planet from 2010 to 2013. Its star, Shorty Rossi, has several enterprises; you can find out more at shortywood.com.

Peace deal challenged without troop commitment Other views

Texto completo: In 1999, I traveled to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Swathed in shawls, exiting my taxi only when sneaking into buildings, I visited secret girls' schools in private apartments, where 10-year-olds braved beatings to learn how to read. I interviewed former female university professors who, under the Taliban, could rarely leave their homes, and then only when shrouded beneath a burka.
And I interviewed then-Taliban deputy health minister Mohammed Abas Stanekzai, who is now one of the negotiators of a "peace deal" with the United States that will probably be signed on Feb. 29, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. So, it is useful to recall what Stanekzai said at the time. He firmly defended excluding girls from schools and women from any Kabul hospital except the sole facility where the Taliban permitted female doctors to work. And women could seek treatment only if accompanied by a male relative, even though many war widows had none.
I can't help recalling Stanekzai's remarks as this "peace process" plays out. Much has changed in Afghanistan over the past 20 years, but there's little sign the Taliban have changed their core positions - on women or much else. So don't be fooled by any upbeat administration rhetoric - U.S. talks with the Taliban are still in for a very bumpy ride. The deal Pompeo cited depends on a precondition of the Taliban holding to a seven-day significant reduction in violence nationwide, beginning with this past weekend.
If the truce holds, intra-Afghan talks will supposedly begin between the Taliban and the elected government along with representatives of different civil society groups. Their goal: to devise a new political arrangement that would include the Taliban.
If the U.S. is satisfied with progress over the next four months, it will draw down its 14,000 military personnel according to an agreed timetable, starting this year. Supposedly a final withdrawal will depend on progress in the Afghan talks and proof the Taliban will keep any new terrorists down.
Yet is highly unlikely that the Taliban (or its fighters) will be willing to become one political party among many. They are demanding a restoration of their former Islamic Emirate, where religious law would replace the current Afghan constitution with its guarantees of basic human rights, including for women. And they want all U.S. troops out soon, which would mean the Afghan army would collapse.
"The Taliban is poised to take it all," says Marvin Weinbaum, head of the Afghanistan-Pakistan program at the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C. "They know the U.S. is desperate to get out." And they hope they can ride U.S. impatience to the victory they can't win in the field.
Toward that end, the Taliban are already trying to burnish their image and airbrush their history. The New York Times ran an op-ed by one of their most bloodthirsty leaders, Sirajuddin Haqqani, on Friday, who is on the U.S. terrorist list, in which he claims "we were forced to defend ourselves" and "the killing must stop." You'd think from his piece that he spoke for all Afghans.
You'd never know from this pious piece that this man's Haqqani network was responsible for some of the bloodiest suicide bomber attacks on Afghan civilians in Kabul. You'd never know that much of Afghanistan is fearful of a Taliban return because they think the group and its fighters distort Islam. You'd never know that Afghan Hazaras - a Shiite ethnic group who make up 10% to 20% of the total population - are terrified, because the Pashtun Sunni Taliban slaughtered them under its rule.
And you'd never know that a new generation of educated Afghans, including female teachers, lawyers, judges, prosecutors and journalists - who consider America an ally - don't want to return to the days of burkas, male guardianship and limited religious education. Under such a regime, their choices would be flight, jail or worse.
No wonder, the New York Times correspondent in Kabul, Mujib Mashal, tweeted that the Haqqani op-ed "omits the most fundamental fact: that Siraj is no Taliban peacemaker as he paints himself, that he's behind some of the most ruthless attacks of this war with many civilian lives lost."
This U.S.-Taliban deal may present an opportunity, but only if the White House holds out for a negotiated solution, not just a photo op at Camp David. And if Trump isn't gulled by Taliban sweet talk. Pulling the plug too soon will destroy all U.S. leverage and hand victory to the Taliban. In that case, this "peace" plan will only produce more tragedy for Afghans and more security threats to the U.S.

President Trump is leading America to become a country with no integrity

Texto completo: Back during the scandal over his sexual exploitation of a young intern, Bill Clinton was pilloried in this space for his moral defects.
To which many liberals responded with derision. Morality? What did that matter? The economy was good, we were at peace and Mr. Clinton was hardly the first man to fool around and lie about it. As one reader put it, he was hired to be a president, not a pope.
At the time, that felt like a rationalization. A generation later, it feels like a portent. Indeed, it is often said that we are living now in Post-Fact America but truth is, we are also living in Post-Integrity America.
No, that's not breaking news. But it's been brought into painfully clear focus these last few days.
One watched - not with surprise anymore, the capacity for that being long lost, but surely with dread and fascination - as President Donald Trump launched his post-impeachment purge of aides deemed insufficiently sycophantic. But that was just a prelude.
Last week, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 people, most of them guilty of lying, fraud, corruption, tax evasion and similar crimes. In other words, the kinds of things of which Mr. Trump has often been accused.
The power to soften or wipe away criminal convictions is one of the nicer perks of the presidency, allowing compassion to be shown to those who deserve it. And in fairness, several of those who benefited last week seem to meet that standard. Crystal Munoz, for instance, had been sentenced to almost 20 years for dealing pot.
But it is worth noting that every person Mr. Trump pardoned or gave clemency to came to his attention not through the normal machinery of government, but through inside connections or else, as The New York Times noted, "were promoted on Fox News." Some were championed by aides and allies. Some had donated big money to his campaign. And again, most had breached the public trust.
Like former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had served eight years of a 14-year sentence for trying to sell Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat. Mr. Trump, who has opined how unfair it is that U.S. companies are not allowed to pay bribes to do business overseas, had called that sentence "ridiculous."
It's no great leap to suggest that he sees himself in Mr. Blagojevich. Or in former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and financier Michael Milken, whom he pardoned for tax fraud and securities fraud, respectively. If granting clemency and pardons opens a window upon a president's moral priorities - and it does - the view offered here suggests an unfortunate affinity for scammers and grifters, an empathy for those on the make, cutting deals, cutting corners, living the dream, until they got caught up by pesky rules designed to enforce integrity. And if those same people happened to give him money or had their names whispered into his ear by a friend, so much the better.
That's not how this is supposed to work. And that it is working this way right out in the open, before our very eyes, suggests - no, screams - Mr. Trump's imperviousness to any sense of ethical affront.
During Mr. Clinton's scandal, it was argued in this space that a president stamps himself upon an era "not simply by legislative accomplishment, but also...by dint of personal authority and moral suasion."
Mr. Trump disproves that. He has stamped himself upon this era while ignoring the very idea of personal authority or moral suasion - and daring us to care. But we had better. By his lack of personal character, Mr. Trump threatens our national character. And he stamps this era with the signature lesson of his life:
Once you give up integrity, it's easy to give up everything else.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - When the Pentagon announced this month that it would divert billions more dollars in military funding to the construction of President Donald Trump's border wall, bipartisan outrage ricocheted across Capitol Hill.
Republicans and Democrats alike issued fiery statements in defense of both their congressional districts, some of which stand to lose valuable work making military equipment, and their constitutionally enshrined power of the purse.
But the howls of protest are unlikely to amount to much in a Congress where lawmakers - many of whom once prized their spending prerogatives almost above all else - acknowledge their power to steer federal dollars has been severely eroded.
The dysfunction has taken hold in large part because of decisions that members of Congress themselves have made.
But it has become pronounced under Trump, who has moved aggressively to divert government money when it suits his agenda.
"Congress' appropriation power, which is pretty much the last unchallenged power that Congress has, has very significantly eroded," said Sean Kelly, a professor of political science at California State University Channel Islands.
The root of the problem predates Trump. For years, Congress has jammed through huge omnibus spending bills that set funding for an entire fiscal year in the final days of legislative sessions.
Lawmakers have also passed a patchwork of short-term spending bills to keep the government from shutting down, which has happened three times during the Trump administration. And while presidents have always had the power to transfer and reallocate funds, Trump has made far wider use of that authority to subvert the will of lawmakers.
The administration is expected to announce another diversion of funds to help pay for construction of a wall on the southern border, Trump's signature campaign promise, in the coming months. The president declared a national emergency last year to allow him to use money not appropriated for the wall to build it.
And while the Senate acquitted Trump this month of impeachment charges stemming from his decision to withhold military funding from Ukraine, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan federal watchdog, found that Trump's actions violated the Impoundment Control Act, which limits a president's ability to refuse to spend money allocated by Congress.
Several lawmakers, including some who are still deeply involved in crafting the dozen must-pass spending bills each year, acknowledge that the annual fiscal process no longer works as it once did.
A large factor, several say, is the demise of earmarks, the power to steer money to lawmakers' pet projects in order to persuade them to take tough votes. Long scorned as a tool of corruption, Congress ultimately banned the practice after a series of scandals that culminated in the imprisonment of lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
"When earmarks were around, they gave members a reason to pay attention to appropriations - they always knew they had some skin in the game," said Kelly, who co-wrote a book about earmarks and their benefit to democracy. "By being penny-wise, we've sort of been pound-foolish."
Some lawmakers in both parties have quietly begun discussing reviving earmarks in a bid to help grease the gears of the spending process. Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, embarked on a listening tour among her colleagues about rebranding earmarks as "community project funding" and implementing more guardrails to avoid abuse.
Trump has also suggested bringing the practice back in some form.
"Members of Congress have the best judgment about what's needed for their districts," Lowey said in an interview in which she described how the administration now wields far more discretion in doling out funds for projects. "Local projects and spending bills also give members a sense of ownership of federal funding."
But the idea has been shelved for the time being. House Democratic leaders hope to pass all 12 spending bills by the end of June, and any effort to revive earmarks was seen as too complex and politically fraught to pursue in such a short time frame and in an election year.
"Clearly, there's a sentiment in the institution that we surrender too much power," said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a member of the Appropriations Committee, who supports the idea of bringing back the practice in some form. "How you get that power back without undercutting the current chief executive, and how you have that discussion in a way that it doesn't partisan-ize it and sends everybody to their corners, is really going to be very tricky."
Fiscal conservatives - particularly Republicans who ran for Congress as budget hawks bent on lowering the debt and reducing government spending - are reluctant to undercut that message now by embracing earmarks.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff who railed against spending during his years as a South Carolina congressman, acknowledged in a recent private question-and-answer session that Republicans are less interested in deficit reduction now that a member of their party is in the White House.
A Democratic aide, insisting on anonymity to describe internal discussions, said that party leaders planned to revisit the discussion of earmarks next year, given the near-unanimous support for it among their members in Congress.
In the meantime, the administration has taken advantage of the natural murkiness that comes with funding programs and policy - and encountered little resistance from lawmakers.
"Congress has been more and more deferential to the president when they're of the same party," said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute. "But on the other hand, we haven't seen a president deviate from appropriations to such a degree."
While the Government Accountability Office found that Trump's decision to withhold $391 million in security assistance for Ukraine violated the law, there is no action or penalty that can be taken as a result.
"These parchment barriers are only as effective so far as when people in power hold themselves to the law," said James Pfiffner, a professor at George Mason University who wrote a book about the impoundment act. "If the person with the most power says, 'I'm not going to play by the rules of the game,' the other people may have the authority, but not the power to enforce the law."

Texto completo: Monday’s 1,031-point stock market plunge certainly brought panic to financiers, traders, policymakers and investors. But did the long stock market rise parallel the fortunes of America’s real economy?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average skyrocketed by more than 20,000 points since its low in March 2009, enriching big investors and enabling President Donald Trump to claim that "our economy is the best it has ever been. " Someone who invested $10 million in an index fund in 2009 would now have more than $50 million. Not bad. Unfortunately, what’s happening on Wall Street has little or no day-to-day relevance to most Americans.
"Journalists are obsessed with the stock market,” says Jacob Hacker, director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University. “But for most Americans, it's a side show in their economic lives. What really matters to them is the security of their jobs and health care, and the amount they have to pay for big-ticket items like housing and education. ”
Real wages for the typical American worker have risen by a mere 5% during the past decade and, in fact, are only about 11% higher than they were in 1979, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
More than 2 out of 5 American workers are in low-wage jobs, defined as less than two-thirds of the median wage. They toil in restaurants, as health aides and janitors. The people who clean sports stadiums make about $14 per hour, picking up trash from sports fans who may pay hundreds of dollars to sit on the 50-yard line.
Most low-wage workers are women and people of color, although there are many white male workers who have low-paying jobs. Of the 11 million single parents in the United States, 8. 5 million are single mothers. And nearly 30% of those mothers live in poverty. Most do not have college educations and could not afford one even if they wanted a four-year degree.
Nearly half of all workers do not have a retirement savings plan and, for many, employer-provided health insurance comes with ever higher deductibles and co-pays.
Workers have strikes against them
Of course, for the half of working Americans with a 401(k) account, today’s stock market decline does mean a loss. But the real problem is the inability of many workers to save, as the median 401(k) balance is just $36,000 for 40- to 49-year-olds with these retirement plans.
Tens of millions of low-income Americans have more than their share of strikes against them: They were formerly incarcerated. They are substance abusers. Millions are jobless, have given up looking for jobs and are out of the workforce, not counted in official unemployment statistics. Millions of working young adults live with their parents because they can’t afford to rent a small apartment.
The Wuhan coronavirus and its impact on the Chinese economy — and potential impact on the global economy — are cited as the major reasons for Monday’s stock market sell-off. However, it is poor, low-wage and even many middle-class Americans who are more likely to be in poor health and have a significantly shorter life expectancy than those who have higher incomes and are well educated. The richest American men live 15 years longer than the poorest.
A huge collapse in the stock market makes little difference to them. How could it, if one is behind on one’s bills, has a broken-down car, needs food stamps to eat and Medicaid to get health care.
Conversely, a 1,000-point drop in the Dow Jones is not going to stop the wealthiest Americans from buying homes around the world and a yacht or private jet where they can drink Dom Perignon. As inequality has grown, the top one-fifth of earners account for about 55% on the nation’s annual income. By comparison, the bottom 20% account for just 4% of all income.
Since investments in equities represent wealth, the wealth comparisons are even more glaring. The top 1% hold nearly 40% of the country’s wealth, significantly more than the middle 60% of the income distribution. If those at the top bewail the millions in stock-market investments wiped out Monday, remember: 2 out of 5 households do not have enough savings to make ends meet for three months at the poverty level if they had no income.
Let’s make the distinction: Today was an awful day for investors, but too many Americans don't have the savings to participate in the stock market at all. For them, today's trillion dollar economic calamity means little.

In Afghanistan, a perilous peace plan: Taliban 'poised to take it all.'

Texto completo: In 1999, I traveled to Afghanistan when the Taliban controlled the country.
Swathed in shawls, exiting my taxi only when sneaking into buildings, I visited secret girls' schools in private apartments, where 10-year-olds braved beatings to learn how to read. I interviewed former female university professors who, under the Taliban, could rarely leave their homes, and then only when shrouded beneath a tentlike burqa.
And I interviewed then-Taliban Deputy Health Minister Mohammed Abas Stanekzai, who is now one of the negotiators of a "peace deal" with the United States that will probably be signed Feb. 29, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
So, it is useful to recall what Stanekzai said at the time. He firmly defended excluding girls from schools and women from any Kabul hospital except the sole facility where the Taliban permitted female doctors to work. And women could seek treatment only if accompanied by a male relative, even though many war widows had none.
I can't help recalling Stanekzai's remarks as this "peace process" plays out. Much has changed in Afghanistan over the past 20 years, but there's little sign the Taliban have changed their core positions -- on women or much else. So don't be fooled by any upbeat administration rhetoric -- U.S. talks with the Taliban are still in for a very bumpy ride.
The deal Pompeo cited depends on a precondition of the Taliban holding to a seven-day significant reduction in violence nationwide, beginning with this past weekend. That is meant to test whether Taliban leaders can control their fighters.
If the truce holds, intra-Afghan talks will supposedly begin between the Taliban and the elected Afghan government along with representatives of different civil society groups. Their goal: to devise a new political arrangement that would include the Taliban. (As if this isn't sufficiently daunting, the Afghan government is mired in a dispute over election results, which could delay the talks).
If the U.S. is satisfied with progress over the next four months, it will draw down its 14,000 military personnel according to an agreed timetable, starting this year. Supposedly a final withdrawal will depend on progress in the Afghan talks and proof the Taliban will keep any new terrorists down.
Yet is highly unlikely that the Taliban (or its fighters) will be willing to become one political party among many. They are demanding a restoration of their former Islamic Emirate, where religious law would replace the current Afghan constitution with its guarantees of basic human rights, including for women. And they want all U.S. troops out soon, which would mean the Afghan army would collapse.
"The Taliban is poised to take it all," says Marvin Weinbaum, head of the Afghanistan-Pakistan program at the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C. "They know the U.S. is desperate to get out." And they hope they can ride U.S. impatience to the victory they can't win in the field.
Toward that end, the Taliban are already trying to burnish their image and airbrush their history. The New York Times ran an op-ed last week by one of the Taliban's most bloodthirsty leaders, Sirajuddin Haqqani, in which he claims "we were forced to defend ourselves" and "the killing must stop," wrote Haqqani, who is on the U.S. terrorist list. You'd think from his piece that he spoke for all Afghans.
You'd never know from this piece that this man's Haqqani network was responsible for some of the bloodiest suicide bomber attacks on Afghan civilians in Kabul.
You'd never know that much of Afghanistan is fearful of a Taliban return -- as I heard over and over when visiting Afghan villages in the last decade -- because they think the group and its fighters distort Islam. You'd never know that Afghan Hazaras -- a Shiite ethnic group who make up 10% to 20% of the total population -- are terrified, because the Taliban slaughtered them under its rule.
And you'd never know that a new generation of educated Afghans, including female teachers, lawyers, judges, prosecutors and journalists -- who consider America an ally -- don't want to return to the days of burqas, male guardianship and limited religious education. Under such a regime, their choices would be flight, jail or worse.
No wonder, the New York Times correspondent in Kabul, Mujib Mashal tweeted that the Haqqani op-ed "omits the most fundamental fact: that Siraj is no Taliban peacemaker as he paints himself, that he's behind some of the most ruthless attacks of this war with many civilian lives lost."
This U.S.-Taliban deal may present an opportunity, but only if the White House holds out for a negotiated solution, not just a photo op at Camp David. And if Trump isn't gulled by Taliban sweet talk.
Pulling the plug too soon will destroy all U.S. leverage and hand victory to the Taliban. In that case, this "peace" plan will only produce more tragedy for Afghans and more security threats to the U.S.

Guilty verdict proves Oscars, wealth -- even walker -- not enough to shield Weinstein from fed-up world

Texto completo: In the end, none of Harvey Weinstein's accoutrements were enough.
Not the Oscars. Not the wealth. Not the walker.
Not the well-placed friends. Not the Gloria Steinem endowed chair he helped fund at Rutgers University in honor of his late mother, Miriam. Not the private security agencies he hired to spy on the women and the journalists trying to expose him.
Not the defense attorney who tried to put the #MeToo movement on trial.
"The pendulum is swinging so far in the overly sensitive direction that men can't really be men, and women can't really be women," Donna Rotunno told Vanity Fair shortly before her client's trial for felony sex crimes began. "I feel that women may rue the day that all of this started when no one asks them out on a date, and no one holds the door open for them, and no one tells them that they look nice."
In the end, it all fell like a house of cards.
Weinstein was convicted Monday of rape and sexual assault in a ruling that could send him to prison for up to 29 years. Sentencing is scheduled for March 11.
"It is a new day," District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said after the jury of seven men and five women found Weinstein, 67, guilty. "It is a new day because Harvey Weinstein has finally been held accountable for crimes he committed. Weinstein is a vicious, serial sexual predator who used his power to threaten, rape, assault and trick, humiliate and silence his victims."
At least 100 women have accused Weinstein of sexual abuse, though just six of them -- actresses Jessica Mann, Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning and Tarale Wulff, production assistant Miriam Haley and scriptwriter Lauren Marie Young -- testified at his trial.
"The reality is that we only got a glimpse of the lives he destroyed," Adrienne Lawrence, author of the upcoming "Staying in the Game: The Playbook for Beating Workplace Sexual Harassment," wrote on Twitter Monday.
But that glimpse was a game-changer.
"Regardless of today's verdict, there is more to being a survivor than validation through the court system," Teresa C. Younger, president and CEO of the Ms. Foundation for Women, wrote in a statement after the verdict. "Telling your story and being heard and believed begins the process of ending sexual abuse by changing the systemic and cultural structures that allow people in positions of power to treat others without dignity, respect, or bodily autonomy.
"To the women who have bravely come forward to bring justice to Harvey Weinstein," Younger continued, "please know that many people around the country and across the world have heard you, believe in you, and have been lifted up by your voice."
Keep going.
New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey detailed the lead-up to their Oct. 5, 2017, Weinstein bombshell in their book, "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement." I went to hear them speak at the Chicago Humanities Festival in October, and they told a story about sharing a cab home from the newsroom well after midnight, just hours before their story would go public on the New York Times website.
They wondered if anyone would read it. They feared maybe not.
So many people had told them, in the course of their reporting, in the hours and weeks and months they spent chasing leads and tracking down sources and interviewing witnesses, that Weinstein was a nonstory. Hollywood's worst-kept secret. Nothing new. The way of the world.
Now that world is changing. They helped change it. As did Ronan Farrow with his reporting for the New Yorker. As did, most of all, the survivors who came forward.
And not just survivors of Weinstein. Survivors who felt an almost imperceptible shift in the culture -- a nascent willingness to listen, an emerging capacity to believe, an ever-so-slight lowering of the defenses we've built to keep ourselves from grappling with the abuses of power baked into so many of our industries, our workplaces, our schools, our places of worship, our teams, our families.
Survivors who used that shift as a terrifying invitation to speak up, in whispers and shouts, about the abuse they had suffered, for far too long, in silence.
Tarana Burke founded the #MeToo movement in 2006. The Weinstein story poured gasoline on it and lit a match. And now a jury made sure the fire wasn't in vain. It's reduced Weinstein's legacy to ashes and keeps the heat where it belongs -- on predators who weaponize their power and hide behind their accoutrements, hoping they'll be enough.
That world is changing. And not a moment too soon.

Texto completo: When the Pentagon announced this month that it would divert billions more dollars in military funding to the construction of President Donald Trump's border wall, bipartisan outrage ricocheted across Capitol Hill.
Republicans and Democrats alike issued fiery statements in defense of both their congressional districts, some of which stand to lose valuable work making military equipment, and their constitutionally enshrined power of the purse.
But the howls of protest are unlikely to amount to much in a Congress where lawmakers -- many of whom once prized their spending prerogatives almost above all else -- acknowledge their power to steer federal dollars has been severely eroded.
The dysfunction has taken hold in large part because of decisions that members of Congress themselves have made.
But it has become pronounced under Trump, who has moved aggressively to divert government money when it suits his agenda.
"Congress' appropriation power, which is pretty much the last unchallenged power that Congress has, has very significantly eroded," said Sean Kelly, a professor of political science at California State University Channel Islands.
The root of the problem predates Trump. For years, Congress has jammed through huge omnibus spending bills that set funding for an entire fiscal year in the final days of legislative sessions.
Lawmakers have also passed a patchwork of short-term spending bills to keep the government from shutting down, which has happened three times during the Trump administration. And while presidents have always had the power to transfer and reallocate funds, Trump has made far wider use of that authority to subvert the will of lawmakers.
The administration is expected to announce another diversion of funds to help pay for construction of a wall on the southern border, Trump's signature campaign promise, in the coming months. The president declared a national emergency last year to allow him to use money not appropriated for the wall to build it.
And while the Senate acquitted Trump this month of impeachment charges stemming from his decision to withhold military funding from Ukraine, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan federal watchdog, found that Trump's actions violated the Impoundment Control Act, which limits a president's ability to refuse to spend money allocated by Congress.
Several lawmakers, including some who are still deeply involved in crafting the dozen must-pass spending bills each year, acknowledge that the annual fiscal process no longer works as it once did.
A large factor, several say, is the demise of earmarks, the power to steer money to lawmakers' pet projects in order to persuade them to take tough votes. Long scorned as a tool of corruption, Congress ultimately banned the practice after a series of scandals that culminated in the imprisonment of lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
"When earmarks were around, they gave members a reason to pay attention to appropriations -- they always knew they had some skin in the game," said Kelly, who co-wrote a book about earmarks and their benefit to democracy. "By being penny-wise, we've sort of been pound-foolish."
Some lawmakers in both parties have quietly begun discussing reviving earmarks in a bid to help grease the gears of the spending process. Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, embarked on a listening tour among her colleagues about rebranding earmarks as "community project funding" and implementing more guardrails to avoid abuse.
Trump has also suggested bringing the practice back in some form.
"Members of Congress have the best judgment about what's needed for their districts," Lowey said in an interview in which she described how the administration now wields far more discretion in doling out funds for projects. "Local projects and spending bills also give members a sense of ownership of federal funding."
But the idea has been shelved for the time being. House Democratic leaders hope to pass all 12 spending bills by the end of June, and any effort to revive earmarks was seen as too complex and politically fraught to pursue in such a short time frame and in an election year.
"Clearly, there's a sentiment in the institution that we surrender too much power," said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a member of the Appropriations Committee, who supports the idea of bringing back the practice in some form. "How you get that power back without undercutting the current chief executive, and how you have that discussion in a way that it doesn't partisan-ize it and sends everybody to their corners, is really going to be very tricky."
Fiscal conservatives -- particularly Republicans who ran for Congress as budget hawks bent on lowering the debt and reducing government spending -- are reluctant to undercut that message now by embracing earmarks.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff who railed against spending during his years as a South Carolina congressman, acknowledged in a recent private question-and-answer session that Republicans are less interested in deficit reduction now that a member of their party is in the White House.
A Democratic aide, insisting on anonymity to describe internal discussions, said that party leaders planned to revisit the discussion of earmarks next year, given the near-unanimous support for it among their members in Congress.
In the meantime, the administration has taken advantage of the natural murkiness that comes with funding programs and policy -- and encountered little resistance from lawmakers.
"Congress has been more and more deferential to the president when they're of the same party," said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute. "But on the other hand, we haven't seen a president deviate from appropriations to such a degree."
While the Government Accountability Office found that Trump's decision to withhold $391 million in security assistance for Ukraine violated the law, there is no action or penalty that can be taken as a result.
"These parchment barriers are only as effective so far as when people in power hold themselves to the law," said James Pfiffner, a professor at George Mason University who wrote a book about the impoundment act. "If the person with the most power says, 'I'm not going to play by the rules of the game,' the other people may have the authority, but not the power to enforce the law."

Texto completo: New Mexico's attorney general has sued Google, saying the tech giant used its educational products to spy on the state's children and families.
Google collected a trove of students' personal information, including data on their physical locations, websites they visited, YouTube videos they watched and their voice recordings, Hector Balderas, New Mexico's attorney general, said in a federal lawsuit filed this month.
Although the company provides school districts with an online dashboard to control student access to YouTube and dozens of other Google apps, some public school officials have said that it can be difficult to parse the tech giant's differing data-mining practices.
Over the past eight years, Google has emerged as the predominant tech brand in American public schools.
Today, more than half of the nation's public schools -- and 90 million students and teachers globally -- use free Google Education apps like Gmail and Google Docs.
The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, comes five months after Google agreed to pay a $170 million fine to settle federal and state charges that it had illegally harvested the personal data of children on YouTube.
The new lawsuit claimed that Google violated a federal law, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which requires companies to obtain a parent's consent before collecting the name, contact information and other personal details from a child under 13.
The lawsuit also said Google deceived schools, parents, teachers and students by telling them that were no privacy concerns with its education products when, in fact, the company had amassed a trove of potentially sensitive details.
Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesman, said the lawsuit's claims were "factually wrong."
"G Suite for Education allows schools to control account access and requires that schools obtain parental consent when necessary," he said. "We do not use personal information from users in primary and secondary schools to target ads."
For years, parents and privacy groups have complained that Google was using its products to track millions of school children without adequately detailing its data-mining practices or obtaining explicit parental consent for the tracking. One issue of contention is that the company applies different privacy policies to different products.
Google has said that its "core" products for schools, including Gmail and Drive, comply with privacy regulations requiring companies to use student data only for school purposes. The company said those core education products do not collect student data for advertising purposes or show targeted ads.
When students log into their Chromebooks, Google turns on a feature that syncs its Chrome browser with other devices used by a student on that account, the lawsuit said. It effectively blends a student's school and personal web activities into a single profile that can be viewed by Google, according to the lawsuit.
Students "begin engaging with Google technology through teachers and in school settings for homework, communication and other educational purposes," Balderas said. Then the same children, he said, go on to use Google services from their phones or at home, "allowing Google to track them for noneducational purposes -- and definitely without the consent of their parents."

Texto completo: Violent incidents are rare at Hawaii schools, so the stabbing of two students at suburban Mililani High on Monday not only alarmed local parents, it quickly made national news.
The victims, a 16-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl, were taken in serious condition to a hospital, and the suspect, also a student, was apprehended by police. An Associated Press story was posted online within hours at news sites including U.S. News &World Report and The New York Times.
“The Mililani High incident was very unfortunate,” said Max Mendoza, director of the state Department of Education’s Safety, Security and Emergency Preparedness Branch. “Overall, our schools remain safe. Stabbing incidents are extremely rare in our schools.”
Before Monday’s attack there had been four assaults reported statewide at Hawaii’s public schools in the 2019-20 academic year, and no incidents involving a knife, according to Mendoza, who responded in writing to questions from the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. There are 179,000 students in Hawaii’s public schools in kindergarten to 12th grade.
“The details surrounding the full facts and circumstances of this incident are still unfolding,” Mendoza wrote. “As the investigation continues and additional information becomes available, we will work closely with our schools to maintain campus safety.”
A similar attack took place at Kalani High School 10 years ago, when a student stabbed another with a knife in math class. He ultimately was sentenced to 18 months in jail and 10 years of probation in a plea deal.
Possession or use of dangerous weapons is prohibited on campus. But some students acknowledge bringing them to school.
The most recent data show that 11.8% of high school students in Hawaii reported carrying some type of weapon on campus at least once within the last 30 days, compared with 15.7% of their peers nationally. There is no breakdown on what sort of instrument in that 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a project of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
While incidents of school shootings are rising across the country, Hawaii shows the opposite trend. Statewide, firearm incidents on public school campuses have fallen to their lowest level in a decade, according to annual reports submitted to the Legislature.
The 2020 report shows 17 incidents involving “firearms,” mostly airguns such as BB and paint guns, and just one handgun reported in the 2018-19 school year. That incident total is a 51% drop from the 35 incidents, including one handgun, that were reported in the 2011-12 academic year.
In last year’s handgun case, a Kapolei High School student brought the weapon to campus on Jan. 18, 2019, and it was quickly confiscated. Over the last 10 years, five handguns and no rifles were reported on Hawaii public school campuses.
Meanwhile, the number of school shootings across the country has soared from 16 in 2011 to 111 last year, according to a national database maintained by Center for Homeland Defense and Security. The 491 incidents between Jan. 1, 2011, and Jan. 19, 2020, include just one case in Hawaii that involved a student with a gun.
In that incident a 14-year-old student at Highlands Intermediate School picked up a handgun he found outdoors on campus at 6:30 a.m. May 23, 2011, and it discharged accidentally when he was showing it to friends and one pushed it away. The weapon was confiscated and he was arrested.
Mendoza said public schools are taking proactive steps to prevent, mitigate and respond to man-made and natural disasters and to keep students safe.
“We have implemented new safety initiatives to mitigate the security challenges associated with our open-campus schools,” he said, “including performing vulnerability assessments, contracting a private security firm to provide active threat response training, and dedicating resources to increase surveillance and overnight security at schools.”

Keep security risks, threats in perspective

Texto completo: Almost daily, we hear about consumer warnings about every type of technology or scam imaginable. The capacity of the criminal mind to come up with innovative ways to steal our money or identities seems endless. But sometimes, a flurry of alerts about some new trend causes people to panic and worry about things that are unlikely to affect them.
Case in point: RFID wallets. A few years ago, tech experts began warning us that our credit card information could be at risk while in our wallets or purses. The threat existed because some credit cards were incorporating Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) chips into the cards in anticipation of contactless payment systems. These little chips — which are different from the EMV chips that most of us now have on our credit and debit cards — produce a small, localized radio signal that would allow a user to use it by simply placing it near a terminal.
Also known as "Tap and Go" cards, contactless payment systems are rising in popularity. They allow you to place your cards close to a payment terminal, but without touching it. And sure enough, the technology exists to zap information right off your credit card while it's sitting in your wallet. But security experts say the chances of getting useful information are remote because the thief would have to get very close to your wallet or purse with a device, and secondly, even if they were to be able to read the information, they wouldn't be able to complete a transaction because they wouldn't have all the information necessary to do so.
Still, the remoteness of the threat hasn't stopped a multimillion-dollar industry of "RFID wallets," devices and sleeves, many of which surround your card in a "Faraday cage" to keep it safe. In fact, these devices do work, but so would wrapping your cards in a piece of aluminum foil. "... Even if you want to invest in these products, you should ask yourself why you are doing it," wrote The Balance's Robert Siciliano in November. "In more than a decade, there has been no reported crime committed using an RFID-enabled device. Zero."
And recently, there have been a flurry of reports of "juice-jacking," a nefarious practice in which would-be identity thieves load malware or viruses onto public recharging stations, such as those found in airports. After the Los Angeles District Attorney's office warned about the practice in November, The Federal Communications Commission and the New York Times even issued their own alerts.
But in response, tech site TechCrunch's Zack Whittaker wrote that the fears may be overblown. Although the L.A. District Attorney's spokesman said there were no current cases on its own books, a spokesperson referred to cases on the East Coast. But when asked, he or she could not name any.
Whittaker talked to security specialists, who told him that such activity had been discussed in theory, but actual cases were elusive. The technology to perform such crime is certainly out there, he concluded, quoting some recent cases which demonstrated it could be done, but there is little evidence that it actually has been.
"Juice-jacking is a real threat, but it's an incredibly complicated and imperfect way to attack someone when there are far easier ways," Whittaker concluded. "And given so many phones have features in place to prevent these kinds of attacks, pulling off a juice-jacking attack would likely require burning a highly powerful exploit."
Regardless of whether such technology-based threats are probable, I've always tended to err on the side of caution. When in an airport, coffee shop or public place, it's probably best not to use a public charging station or unencrypted Wi-Fi. Bring your own cable or use a portable recharging device. And if you're worried about somebody stealing your credit-card information out of your wallet, buying a new one with a little extra protection couldn't hurt.

Texto completo: L Brands will sell its majority stake in lingerie brand Victoria's Secret to a private equity firm for $1.1 billion.
The deal gives Sycamore Partners a 55% interest in Victoria's Secret lingerie, Victoria's Secret Beauty and Pink brands, the company said in a statement late Thursday.
"We believe the separation of Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Victoria's Secret Beauty and PINK into a privately held company provides the best path to restoring these businesses to their historic levels of profitability and growth," said Leslie Wexner, chairman and CEO of L Brands, in a statement."
When the transaction closes, Wexner will step down as chairman and CEO to assume the title chairman emeritus.
L Brands will control a 45% minority stake in Victoria's Secret, with Bath & Body Works remaining a standalone public company.
After dropping roughly 12% in pre-market trading, L Brands shares rebounded later in the morning to $24.15 share, a dip of less than 1%.
Victoria's Secret, which generated about $7 billion in revenue last year, experienced a 10% decline in same-store sales during the fourth quarter and a 12% decline in same-store sales during this past holiday season.
The Victoria's Secret brand has faced additional troubles recently, including the cancellation of its annual fashion show. In early February, The New York Times detailed accusations of "misogyny, bullying and harassment" within the company. The report prompted a letter signed by more than 100 models to CEO John Mehas demanding that the lingerie company increase efforts to "protect the people they profit from."
Meanwhile, Wexner has come under fire for his connection to financier Jeffrey Epstein, who served as his personal adviser. Wexner alleged in August that Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family."
Retail analysts said the split will help L Brands focus on the better performing parts of its business and reduce closings. Visalia Mall has both Bath and Body Works, Victoria's Secret and PINK locations in the retail center.
"The separation of Victoria's Secret into a private entity will enable L Brands to reduce debt and focus on its strong core business of Bath & Body Works, which represents over 80% of its operating income," Moody's vice president Christina Boni said in an investors note.
Victoria's Secret can also benefit from new ownership, says Neil Saunders, managing director of Global Data, a retail consultancy.
"Sycamore will be keen to maximize its investment and its closer involvement with the company will bring new thinking and ultimately a new positioning for the brand," Saunders said in an investors note. "We expect this to be more authentic, less sexualized, and more attuned to the way most consumers now think."

Texto completo: Scorned filmmaker Harvey Weinstein's precipitous fall from grace came to a Hollywood-sized finale Monday when a Manhattan jury convicted the one-time movie mogul of rape and sexual assault.
But Weinstein's long-awaited day of #MeToo reckoning arrived with a dramatic plot twist. The jury that added "rapist" to his list of credits also found Weinstein not guilty of the top charge of predatory sexual assault - meaning the Oscar-winner dodged a possible life sentence.
The bewildered Weinstein, once one of the most powerful people in Tinseltown, stared straight ahead as he was convicted in Manhattan Supreme Court of forcibly performing oral sex on a woman in 2006 and of third-degree rape in 2013.
As the jury was ushered back behind closed doors, Weinstein remained seated at the defense table, with several court officers standing close by. He then began whispering to his lawyers before he was escorted - in handcuffs - out of the courtroom, without the aid of the walker he had been using since the trial began.
The disgraced movie mogul faces anywhere from five to 25 years behind bars on the top charge of forced oral sex, and up to four years for third-degree rape. Justice James Burke ordered Weinstein to be remanded until his sentencing March 11.
Weinstein's team of five high-powered attorneys immediately vowed to appeal.
Actress Annabella Sciorra - who testified during the trial that the beefy behemoth had shoved her on a bed and raped her two decades ago - said sharing her story was painful, but necessary.
"I spoke for myself and with the strength of the 80-plus victims of Harvey Weinstein in my heart," she said in a statement released at the trial's end.
"While we hope for continued righteous outcomes that bring absolute justice, we can never regret breaking the silence. For in speaking truth to power we pave the way for a more just culture, free of the scourge of violence against women."
Sciorra's lawyer Gloria Allred - who also represents Weinstein accuser Miriam Haley - said the jury reached the right decision.
"I just heard [Weinstein's] attorney said that he was shocked, that he was surprised by the verdict. Well, he shouldn't have been surprised," she said.
"If you do to women what [he did], you shouldn't be surprised ... you shouldn't be shocked, you should've been prepared for this. It's no longer business as usual in America. This is the age of empowerment of women and you cannot intimidate them anymore," Allred said.
The verdict ended five days of intense deliberations at the nearly monthlong trial in lower Manhattan.
The decision followed a tumultuous week where the jury of seven men and five women asked Burke if they could deliver a divided verdict in the extraordinarily high-profile prosecution of the exceptionally well-known defendant. The panel indicated in a Friday note that jurors were hung up on the top counts of predatory sexual assault that were tied to Sciorra's rape testimony.
The 67-year-old Weinstein opted not to take the stand in his own defense. He heard the verdict along with his hard-charging defense team inside the jam-packed courtroom.
A few hours later, Weinstein was transported in an ambulance to Rikers Island, where he was going to be admitted into the infirmary, according to his defense lawyer Donna Rotunno. But he was then rerouted to Bellevue Hospital because of high blood pressure, chest pains and palpitations, Rotunno later told the Daily News.
"He's fine," she added.
The Academy Award-winning producer of "Shakespeare in Love" was accused in the last three years by some 90 women with sexual misconduct ranging in tenor from insensitive to indictable across the decades. Weinstein, who still faces criminal charges in California, has maintained all the sexual encounters were consensual.
His trial marked the highest-profile #MeToo prosecution since comedian Bill Cosby's April 2018 sexual assault conviction.
Manhattan jurors convicted Weinstein of raping aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013 and sexually assaulting his former production assistant Haley in 2006, with both women taking the stand to testify against him.
Four other accusers, including Emmy-nominated actress Sciorra of "The Sopranos," testified in excruciating detail about their unwanted sexual encounters with Weinstein as prosecutors presented the jury with evidence of an alleged pattern of horrific behavior.
Actress Rosie Perez recounted how a terrified Sciorra, after telling her she was raped by the filmmaker, explained why she didn't go to the police: The powerful Weinstein, a friend of President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, would "destroy me."
Weinstein's defense team called just seven witnesses inside the 15th-floor courtroom, while prosecutors summoned 28 people to testify - with their case anchored by the emotional accounts delivered through tears and sobs by the half-dozen accusers.
The witnesses wept as they conjured up gut-wrenching memories for the jury, with Sciorra describing in detail the winter night in 1993-94 when the hulking Weinstein burst into her Manhattan apartment and allegedly raped the 110-pound actress.
"He kept coming at me," said Sciorra, the first Weinstein accuser to testify against him at a criminal trial. "I felt overpowered because he was very big. ... I was just trying to get away from him and he put my hands over my head to hold me back, and he got on top of me and he raped me."
Mann, who spent three days on the witness stand, told jurors how the disgraced Hollywood mogul raped her inside his room at the DoubleTree Hotel in Midtown on March 18, 2013.
Mann said after trapping her inside his room, Weinstein instructed her "like a drill sergeant" to get undressed before raping her. After the assault, she discovered a just-used needle inside a bathroom trash can - left there by Weinstein, who injected himself with an unknown drug to get an erection. Mann, a Washington State native and one-time evangelical Christian, also accused the "Pulp Fiction" producer of raping her a second time at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif., in November 2013.
Mann was aggressively cross-examined during her three days on the stand, describing her volatile relationship with the once larger-than-life producer. She described a complex relationship that included sexual encounters that were non-consensual, consensual and often forced or coerced.
Haley, a Swedish citizen who worked briefly off the books as a production assistant on the set of "Project Runway," testified that Weinstein lured her to his SoHo loft in summer 2006. He proceeded to pin her to a bed and perform forcible oral sex.
"I started realizing what was actually happening: I'm being raped," Haley testified. "He held me down on the bed and he forced himself on me orally."
Defense attorneys used friendly emails Haley had sent to Weinstein after the sex assault to try to discredit her testimony, and noted that she flew to Los Angeles on his dime just a few days later.
The trial began more than two years after allegations of sexual misconduct were first published about Weinstein in The New York Times and The New Yorker in October 2017.
Weinstein still faces felony charges in California for forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint stemming from a pair of 2013 incidents.

Dems slam Castro remarks Florida lawmakers, officials fear Sanders could doom odds of victory over Trump election 2020

Texto completo: Democratic leaders in Florida are condemning their party's presidential front-runner, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, for his comments about former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, in a potential preview of the uncomfortable relationship Sanders and state Democrats might have during a general electionbattle against President Donald Trump.
The firestorm over Sanders' comments on "60 Minutes" on Sunday night fueled fears from Florida Democrats that a Sanders candidacy would damage their chances of winning the state in November by alienating some Hispanics, a key constituency.
"The conventional wisdom and Florida's voting history suggests Sanders' embrace of socialism is not going to get him a majority of voters here in Florida," said Aubrey Jewett, political science professor at the University of Central Florida, citing Andrew Gillum's loss in the 2018 governor's race to Trump ally Gov. Ron DeSantis. "And for Democratic candidates down-ticket, a lot of them could say, 'We've got to separate ourselves from the guy at the top.' "
Sanders was asked on "60 Minutes" about his previous statements about the Castro regime in Cuba, including a visit to the communist-led island in the late 1980s, in which he praised some of the country's social programs.
"We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba, but you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad," Sanders said. "You know? When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing?"
The comments drew an immediate backlash from Democrats, especially those from South Florida and its large Cuban population - the younger generation of which has been trending Democratic after years of being a solid GOP constituency.
"As the first South American immigrant member of Congress who proudly represents thousands of Cuban Americans, I find Senator Bernie Sanders' comments on Castro's Cuba absolutely unacceptable," said U.S. Rep. Debbie Murcasel-Powell, D-Miami, in a tweet.
Her fellow South Florida Democrat, U.S. Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Miami, also tweeted, "I'm hoping that in the future, Senator Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro."
U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Orlando, a national co-chair of one of Sanders' chief rivals for the Democratic nomination, Michael Bloomberg, had the sharpest response, calling Sanders' comments "ill-informed & insulting to thousands of Floridians."
"Castro was a murderous dictator who oppressed his own people," Murphy said in a tweet. "His 'literacy program' wasn't altruistic; it was a cynical effort to spread his dangerous philosophy & consolidate power. Whether the subject is Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Israel or other foreign policy challenges, [Sanders] has consistently taken positions that are wrong on the merits and will alienate many Florida voters now and in the general election if he is nominated."
The Florida Democratic Party also issued a statement that didn't mention Sanders by name, but the intent was clear.
"Florida Democrats condemn dictators who toppled democracies across the globe and stand in solidarity with the thousands of people who have fled violent dictatorships in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua," state chair Terrie Rizzo said. "Candidates need to understand our immigrant communities' shared stories."
In response to the backlash, Sanders campaign spokesman Kolby Lee said the candidate "has clearly and consistently criticized Fidel Castro's authoritarianism and condemned his human rights abuses, and he's simply echoing President Obama's acknowledgment that Cuba made progress, especially in education."
Lee cited Obama's remarks in Havana, Cuba, in 2016 during a reconciliation visit, in which the former president said, "The United States recognizes progress that Cuba has made as a nation, its enormous achievements in education and in health care."
The underlying fear in many Democrats' comments was that Sanders would drive away Hispanic voters.
Samuel Vilchez Santiago, a Democrat and a Venezuelan American activist from Orlando, has been trying to garner Venezuelan support for Democrats amid a push by the GOP to win over some of that community through Trump's hard line on Venezuela's leftist leader Nicolas Maduro.
Sanders' comments, he said, "were an unnecessary mistake, but they were a continuation of comments he made about dictatorships in Latin America, including Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. ... This is going to be a huge issue if Bernie Sanders wins the nomination. Many people in Florida ran away from those brutal dictatorships."
Republicans, meanwhile, quickly jumped in to take advantage of the Democratic in-fighting.
"Good luck Democrats who may try and distance themselves from Sanders' praise of communist dictators," said Emma Vaughn, Florida spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.
But Jewett cautioned that Trump's victory in 2016 - when he faced many of the same distancing from Republican lawmakers and candidates that Sanders could face from his own party - shows it is premature to write off Sanders' chances in the Sunshine State.
Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, for example, said in Orlando in 2016, "The choice the state of Florida has is simple: Do you want Trump to be the nominee or not? If it's Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton wallops us. Hillary Clinton wallops Donald Trump."
Trump, of course, won both Florida and the presidency.
"Things do change," Jewett said. "And in the era of Donald Trump, anything is possible."

Texto completo: Maybe the results of the South Carolina primary will point the way to a better strategy to slow down the Sanders juggernaut.
Are you, like me, waiting to vote in the upcoming primary until the South Carolina results give us a better idea about who the viable Democratic presidential candidates are going to be?
In 1984 local Democrats in Iredell County faced a similar dilemma. In a three-way Democratic primary race for a congressional seat, there were three candidates: a liberal, a conservative, and me, the one in the middle. The local party leadership supported the conservative candidate, State Senator Ben Tison. They believed that he would be most likely to win support from the mostly conservative local electorate in the November general election.
They also knew that they would have a tough time supporting a liberal congressional candidate in the fall election. They knew it would be hard to hold their traditional Democratic base together for the rest of their party's ticket.
When Tison was eliminated in the first primary, I rushed to Mooresville to ask for support in the run-off against liberal Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Greene. I still remember the endorsement their leader gave me. "What we need to win this fall is a conservative Democrat. And D.G. is the closest thing that we got."
Today's North Carolina Democrats, who fear they cannot beat Donald Trump with Bernie Sanders, do face a dilemma something like the one that was before the Iredell County Democrats in 1984. But today's challenge is more serious and difficult.
After Nevada, Sanders, with solid support from a host of Democrats, faces a scattered group of candidates, any one of whom might be able to beat Trump in the fall. But none of them can beat Sanders, as long as the entire group is in the race.
In other words, while any one of them by him or herself might be able to gather enough support to beat Sanders in North Carolina's March 3 primary, none could do it if the votes are split among former Vice President Joe Biden, former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and others, including the complicating candidacy of Senator Elizabeth Warren.
So how do "Never Bernie Sanders" Democrats keep the inevitable Sanders nomination from happening?
Maybe it would be impossible.
The New York Times columnist Ross Douthat suggests how it could happen. He wrote after the Nevada caucuses, "Against an unconventional front-runner, unconventional measures are required."
He concedes that there are no sure-fire unconventional measures such as several candidates coalescing around one strong one. "There isn't an obvious unity ticket equivalent for the non-Sanders Democrats, but the dynamic between Bloomberg, Biden and Buttigieg is worth watching. They are all positioned as moderate alternatives to the Sanders revolution, and after South Carolina and Super Tuesday one of them may look a lot more viable than the others. In which case two of the B's swiftly dropping out and just as swiftly campaigning and fund-raising for (or simply funding, in Bloomberg's case) the third might be the only chance at a not-Sanders consolidation. And that chance is worth taking" because, as Douthat writes, "a world where Sanders is on track to get a clear delegate plurality in late March is probably a world where he gets a majority by May."
Maybe the results of the South Carolina primary will point the way to a better strategy to slow down the Sanders juggernaut. I will wait and see before I vote on March 3, but I am not holding my breath.
D.G. Martin hosts "North Carolina Bookwatch," Sunday 3:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 5 p.m. on UNC-TV. The program also airs on the North Carolina Channel Tuesday at 8 p.m. and other times.

Texto completo: Barbara Smith, a fashion model who created a business empire by catering to the tastes of aspiring black professionals with her restaurants, television shows, bedding and furniture collections and books on entertaining, died Saturday at her home on Long Island. She was 70.
The cause was early-onset Alzheimer's disease, her family said. Smith had waged a long and public battle with the disease, which was diagnosed when she was in her 50s.
Smith was best known for her popular Manhattan restaurant, B. Smith's. Located at the edge of the theater district, it opened in 1986 and almost immediately attracted a following among affluent black New Yorkers, who welcomed it as a stylish gathering spot. Essence magazine, in 1995, described it as the place "where the who's who of black Manhattan meet, greet and eat regularly."
Smith opened a successful offshoot in Union Station in Washington, D.C., in 1994 and four years later in Sag Harbor, New York, where she and her second husband and business partner, Dan Gasby, maintained a summer house.
Often called the black Martha Stewart, Smith translated her sense of style into a series of books on cooking and entertaining; a syndicated weekly television show on NBC, "B. Smith with Style"; a bedding, tableware and bath products collection for Bed Bath & Beyond; and a furniture line for the La-Z-Boy company that mingled African and Asian elements.
Her ventures achieved crossover success, attracting customers beyond her core black clientele. The Washington Post wrote that her restaurant in Washington "manages to transcend racial lines," adding that "like a well-whisked beurre blanc, the races here mingle without separating."
In an interview with National Public Radio in 2007, Smith said: "What B. Smith's brand is about is bringing people together. I think that if Martha Stewart and Oprah had a daughter, it would be B. Smith."
Barbara Elaine Smith was born Aug. 24, 1949, in Everson, Pennsylvania. Her father, William, was a steelworker. Her mother, Florence (Claybrook) Smith, was a part-time maid with a flair for interior decorating that she had once hoped to make her career.
From early childhood, Barbara was a whirlwind. "I inherited a paper route, I sold magazines, had lemonade stands, I was a candy striper and into fundraising," she told The New York Times in 2011. "I've always enjoyed being busy."
With her father, a Jehovah's Witness, she went door to door selling copies of the magazines The Watchtower and Awake! and learned valuable lessons along the way. "One thing about being a Jehovah's Witness," she often said, "you learn to talk to people."
When she was barred from joining the Future Homemakers of America because of her race, she started her own home-economics club and named herself president.
In high school she saw an advertisement for the John Robert Powers modeling school and pestered her father to allow her to attend. When she convinced him that it was a finishing school, he relented. She raised the tuition money by babysitting.
After graduating from high school, Smith modeled for department stores in Pittsburgh and got a job as a ground hostess with TWA. Her first big break came in 1969, when she won a place at the Ebony Fashion Fair, a show that traveled to 77 cities across the United States. Along the way she shortened her first name to B.
Two years later, she was signed by the prestigious Wilhelmina agency in New York and began appearing on magazine covers and in print ads, her fresh, girl-next-door looks ideally suited for products like Oil of Olay and Noxzema. She appeared multiple times on the covers of Ebony and Essence, and in July 1976 became only the second black model to appear on the cover of Mademoiselle.
As her modeling career waned, Smith began looking for other outlets. She sang in nightclubs and tried her hand at acting, without much success, although she would later take a role in the off-Broadway play "Love, Loss and What I Wore," by Nora and Delia Ephron, which had a short run in 2011.
In the 1980s she worked as a hostess and floor manager at America, a large restaurant near Union Square Park operated by the Ark restaurant group. The management, impressed, agreed to help her start her own restaurant, and B. Smith's, the restaurant, was born. After parting ways with Ark in 1999, she moved B. Smith's from Eighth Avenue and 47th Street around the corner to 46th Street.
It was at her Manhattan restaurant that she met Gasby, a marketing executive who helped her develop her television show. Her first marriage, to the HBO executive Don Henderson, ended in divorce. Besides Gasby, survivors include her stepdaughter, Dana Gasby and two brothers, Ronald and Dennis Smith.
Buoyed by the success of her restaurants, Smith wrote two books on home entertaining, "B. Smith's Entertaining and Cooking for Friends" (1995) and "B. Smith's Rituals and Celebrations" (1999). A cookbook followed, "B. Smith Cooks Southern Style" (2009).
In her late 50s she began showing the first signs of Alzheimer's disease. When it was formally diagnosed, Smith publicly announced that she was suffering from the disease. She had closed her Sag Harbor and Washington restaurants a year earlier, and in 2015 the original B. Smith's closed.
In 2018, Gasby said that he had begun a relationship with another woman. Responding to criticism from Smith's fans, he wrote in a Facebook post, "I love my wife but I can't let her take away my life."
With Gasby and Vanity Fair editor Michael Shnayerson, Smith described her struggles in "Before I Forget: Love, Hope, Help and Acceptance in Our Fight Against Alzheimer's," published in 2016.

Texto completo: Pennsylvania voters have a new resource to check as they prepare to go to the polls for the April 28 primary.
The Department of State has launched 67 new webpages - one for each county - where voters can learn specifics about their county's voting system and how to use it, Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar announced today.
"We want to make sure all voters go to the polls feeling confident and equipped with the information they need to cast their ballots on their new voter-verifiable paper ballot voting systems," Boockvar said. "These customized websites will help ensure that all voters understand how to use the new auditable voting systems in use in their counties and give all Pennsylvania voters a clear understanding of the voting tools and options available to them."
Each webpage includes a description of the county's voting system along with photos and videos that guide voters through a step-by-step process of how to use the system. The webpages also include accessibility information for voters with disabilities and contact information for county election offices if voters have additional questions.
The county webpages are part of the Department of State's Ready to Vote 2020 initiative, which aims to educate voters about new voting systems and other changes ahead of the 2020 elections. Among the resources available through Ready to Vote is a toolkit that groups and organizations can use to share reliable information about voting in Pennsylvania. The department's votesPA.com website and the toolkit explain the significant voting reforms in Act 77, including the new option to vote by mail-in ballot.
For more information on voting in Pennsylvania, go to the Department of State's website, www.votespa.com.

Dems blast Sanders' comments on Castro State leaders fear senator couldn't beat out Trump

Texto completo: Democratic leaders in Florida are condemning their party's presidential front-runner, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, for his comments about former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, in a potential preview of the uncomfortable relationship Sanders and state Democrats might have during a general election battle against President Trump.
The firestorm over Sanders' comments on "60 Minutes" on Sunday night fueled fears from Florida Democrats that a Sanders candidacy would damage their chances of winning the state in November by alienating some Hispanics, a key constituency.
"The conventional wisdom and Florida's voting history suggests Sanders' embrace of socialism is not going to get him a majority of voters here in Florida," said Aubrey Jewett, political science professor at the University of Central Florida, citing Andrew Gillum's loss in the 2018 governor's race to Trump ally Gov. Ron DeSantis. "And for Democratic candidates down-ticket, a lot of them could say, 'We've got to separate ourselves from the guy at the top.'"
Sanders was asked on "60 Minutes" about his previous statements about the Castro regime in Cuba, including a visit to the communist-led island in the late 1980s, in which he praised some of the country's social programs.
"We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad," Sanders said. "You know? When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing?"
The comments drew an immediate backlash from Democrats, especially those from South Florida and its large Cuban population - the younger generation of which has been trending Democratic after years of being a solid GOP constituency.
"As the first South American immigrant member of Congress who proudly represents thousands of Cuban Americans, I find Senator Bernie Sanders' comments on Castro's Cuba absolutely unacceptable," said U.S. Rep. Debbie Murcasel-Powell, D-Miami, in a tweet.
Her fellow South Florida Democrat, U.S. Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Miami, also tweeted, "I'm hoping that in the future, Senator Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro."
U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Orlando, a national co-chair of one of Sanders' chief rivals for the Democratic nomination, Michael Bloomberg, had the sharpest response, calling Sanders' comments "ill-informed & insulting to thousands of Floridians."
"Castro was a murderous dictator who oppressed his own people," Murphy said in a tweet. "His 'literacy program' wasn't altruistic; it was a cynical effort to spread his dangerous philosophy & consolidate power. Whether the subject is Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Israel or other foreign policy challenges, [Sanders] has consistently taken positions that are wrong on the merits and will alienate many Florida voters now and in the general election if he is nominated."
The Florida Democratic Party also issued a statement that didn't mention Sanders by name, but the intent was clear.
"Florida Democrats condemn dictators who toppled democracies across the globe and stand in solidarity with the thousands of people who have fled violent dictatorships in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua," state chair Terrie Rizzo said. "Candidates need to understand our immigrant communities' shared stories."
In response to the backlash, Sanders campaign spokesman Kolby Lee said the candidate "has clearly and consistently criticized Fidel Castro's authoritarianism and condemned his human rights abuses, and he's simply echoing President Obama's acknowledgment that Cuba made progress, especially in education."
Lee cited Obama's remarks in Havana, Cuba, in 2016 during a reconciliation visit, in which the former president said, "The United States recognizes progress that Cuba has made as a nation, its enormous achievements in education and in health care."
The underlying fear in many Democrats' comments was that Sanders would drive away Hispanic voters.
Samuel Vilchez Santiago, a Democrat and a Venezuelan American activist from Orlando, has been trying to garner Venezuelan support for Democrats amid a push by the GOP to win over some of that community through Trump's hard line on Venezuela's leftist leader Nicolas Maduro.
Sanders' comments, he said, "were an unnecessary mistake, but they were a continuation of comments he made about dictatorships in Latin America, including Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. ... This is going to be a huge issue if Bernie Sanders wins the nomination. Many people in Florida ran away from those brutal dictatorships."
Republicans, meanwhile, quickly jumped in to take advantage of the Democratic in-fighting.
"Good luck Democrats who may try and distance themselves from Sanders' praise of communist dictators," said Emma Vaughn, Florida spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.
But Jewett cautioned that Trump's victory in 2016 - when he faced many of the same distancing from Republican lawmakers and candidates that Sanders could face from his own party - shows it is premature to write off Sanders' chances in the Sunshine State.
Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, for example, said in Orlando in 2016, "The choice the state of Florida has is simple: Do you want Trump to be the nominee, or not? If it's Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton wallops us. Hillary Clinton wallops Donald Trump."
Trump, of course, won both Florida and the presidency.
"Things do change," Jewett said. "And in the era of Donald Trump, anything is possible."

Crossroads Church, nonprofit erase debts

Texto completo: "Jesus, before we knew who he was, he died for us, to forgive our debt. And here, we don't know who these people are, and we are putting this money for their debt to be forgiven."
Victor Martinez
spiritual growth site leader
Crossroads Church senior pastor Brian Tome mentioned the campaign nearly in passing.
He spent about three minutes describing the burden of medical debt during his Nov. 23 sermon, entitled "The Marks of Multiplication." Tome said members of the congregation could text "MULTIPLY" to 313131 to help "free others from medical debt," but insisted the campaign was not a challenge.
Just an awareness.
It was also a great metaphor for his lesson on multiplicity.
"When we are in debt, a sin debt to God, we can't get our way out of the sin debt to God," he said during the sermon. "Jesus comes and gives himself so we can pay off our sin debt, so we never have to worry about God hurting us for our sin."
Crossroads could give to free others' debt, too, he said. And for every dollar they raised, Crossroad's partner RIP Medical Debt would leverage that dollar to abolish $100 in medical debt, therefore multiplying the church's impact.
Within a week and a half, members of the Crossroads community donated enough to abolish over $46.5 million in medical debt nationwide.
Over $42 million of those funds came back to Ohio families.
"Most of it probably that weekend," said Crossroads director of marketing Brennan Hill. "Cuz I think most people, if I had to guess, were doing it in real time. You know, if they were literally getting their phones out and texting in."
Nationwide numbers Church officials announced the impact of their campaign Sunday morning.
Most of the funds came back to Ohio families, since the church is based out of the Cincinnati region. But the sermons are streamed online, which means anyone in the nation can tune in and participate.
RIP Medical Debt is able to track the donations back to their original zip codes to give back. So, if you donated from Indiana, your donation was multiplied and given back to your community in Indiana.
In Ohio, church officials say, they have abolished $42.8 million in debts across 41,233 households in 103 ZIP codes.
They also abolished $1.9 million in debt across 2,974 Kentucky households, $1.5 million across 503 Tennessee households and $200,000 across 136 Indiana households.
What is RIP Medical Debt? An article posted by USA Today last year explains that RIP Medical Debt is a nonprofit organization based out of Rye, New York, that arranges debt payoffs.
The article said medical debt contributes to two-thirds of bankruptcies, according to the American Journal of Public Health. And a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll showed that of the 26 percent of people who reported problems paying medical bills, 59 percent reported a major life impact, such as taking an extra job, cutting other household spending or using up savings.
"How sad that probably the only debt that you don't choose to get – cuz you don't choose to get sick – and it's the one that's affecting most people," said Victor Martinez, spiritual growth site leader for the Oakley location.
When a person can't pay a bill, that debt is often packaged with other people's debt and sold to bill collectors for some fraction of the total amount of the bill. RIP Medical Debt buys debt portfolios on this secondary market for pennies on the dollar with money from its donors.
But instead of collecting the debt, RIP forgives it.
To be eligible for repayment from RIP, the debtor must be earning less than twice the federal poverty level (about $50,000 a year for an individual), have debts that are 5% or more of their annual income and have more debt than assets.
Because hospitals and doctors are eager to get those hard-to-collect debts off their books, they sell them cheap.
Working this way puts a high-dollar project within reach of even small churches. Revolution Annapolis, a nondenominational Maryland church with Sunday attendance of around 200 and without a permanent building, wiped out $1.9 million in debt for 900 families in March. Total amount raised: $15,000.
A debt that never goes away... even if you don't know about it According to the Federal Trade Commission, debt collectors have a certain number of years they can sue you and win to collect a debt. This rule is called the statute of limitations, and is six years in Ohio.
This means that for any type of debt, a creditor cannot sue a debtor for debt collection purposes after six years, according to America's Debt Help Organization. That timeframe begins when someone fails to make a payment on a debt. The clock will start again if you make a payment or provide written acknowledgment of your debt after the first six years are up.
Martinez says that because of this law, many people who got a letter explaining that their debt had been abolished thanks to Crossroads didn't even know they had medical debt. If it was after those six years, hospitals and debt collectors had stopped calling.
"If those six years pass, then nobody can give you a call asking for that money," Martinez said. "But you still owe that money, technically. And the only way that you can really get rid of it is if you file bankruptcy, or if you pay for it."
Medical debt never goes away. It will stay on your record if you don't pay it. The law just states that if you don't pay it within that six year window, people will stop asking you to pay – not that you are off the hook.
Martinez said that now that he understands how the law works, he's afraid to call and ask if he owes anything. Because, what if he owes a lot of money? He'll be accountable to pay it, he said.
"That is very scary," he said. "Because what if I have medical debt that I don't know about?"
'A great analogy to what Jesus did for us.' Crossroads officials did not want this story to be about them.
"We kept it off social media," Hill said. "We really want it to be about people in our community, like I said, who are currently giving."
Crossroads members don't know who specifically they have impacted. They could not choose whose debt to pay off. In a letter to each debtor, Crossroads explained the campaign and said that they hope to provide more resources for those in need, whether that is through prayer or connecting them with healthcare professionals in their community.
"We don't want this to be the last interaction that we have with them, but there are no strings attached," Hill said."We just hope that they understand who Crossroads is, what our heart is for the community, maybe set foot in one of our sites."
This whole experience has been a great analogy to what Jesus did for us, Martinez said.
"Jesus, before we knew who he was, he died for us, to forgive our debt," Martinez said. "And here, we don't know who these people are, and we are putting this money for their debt to be forgiven."
"Jesus, before we knew who he was, he died for us, to forgive our debt. And here, we don't know who these people are, and we are putting this money for their debt to be forgiven."

Campaign-Finance Laws Created Candidate Bloomberg

Texto completo: House Democrats held a panicked hearing this month about how to respond to the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which upheld the right of corporations to spend in elections. Their concern was the undue influence corporate spending might have on the coming elections.
In the entire 2016 campaign cycle, corporations spent less than $300 million on federal races, less than 5% of total spending. Meanwhile, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has already spent more than $360 million on cable, broadcast and radio advertisements since declaring his candidacy in mid-November. That doesn't include Mr. Bloomberg's spending on staff, office space, logistics and internet advertising. Overturning Citizens United wouldn't touch that money.
"It's a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate," tweeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The Washington Post's Greg Sargent typifies liberal angst with the claim that Mr. Bloomberg's spending "threatens to constitute a moral and political disaster."
Whether Mr. Bloomberg's ad barrage translates to more than a brief blip in the polls remains to be seen -- he was savaged by his rivals in his first debate.
But Mr. Bloomberg's ad campaign is likely to help the eventual Democratic nominee, whether it is Mr. Bloomberg or someone else. Many of his ads directly attack President Trump. Since Mr. Bloomberg is a candidate, federal law mandates that he get the lowest unit ad rate. If Mr. Bloomberg used the same money to fund a super PAC, it would have to pay market rates. Thus being a candidate wins Mr. Bloomberg an advantage in softening up Mr. Trump for the Democratic nominee. At the same time, super PACs backing other candidates have to pay far more for their ads than Mr. Bloomberg does, while their campaigns are subject to strict limits on the size of contributions they can receive. The former mayor doesn't need contributions.
But all this misses an even bigger elephant in the room: Bloomberg Media, which Mr. Bloomberg owns. Federal law exempts the institutional press from campaign finance restrictions, allowing media corporations to coordinate their spending with campaigns -- which is illegal for other corporations -- and to avoid burdensome reporting requirements, all the while spending what they want to elect their favored candidates. Favorable media coverage -- or hostile coverage of an opponent -- is invaluable.
A media corporation owned or controlled by a candidate is excluded from the exemption unless its coverage is part of "a general pattern of campaign-related news" that gives "reasonably equal coverage to all opposing candidates." But unless and until they are formally nominated, Mr. Bloomberg and President Trump are not, under the law, considered "opposing candidates." The law holds that until then, Mr. Bloomberg is competing only with other Democrats for the nomination. So for now, Bloomberg News is free to trash the president and his policies all it wants.
Thus, attacking the president and sparing his Democratic rivals is the official policy of Bloomberg News and its 2,700 reporters. Bloomberg's editor in chief has written, "We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike . . . and we will extend the same policy to his [Democratic] rivals." But it "will continue to investigate the Trump administration."
Even if Mr. Bloomberg becomes the Democratic nominee, there is no way to prevent Bloomberg News from shaping its coverage of the economy and current events to help its owner's candidacy or harm the president's. For example, despite the strong economy, on a recent weekend Bloomberg News headlines included: "In Hot U.S. Jobs Market, Half of College Grads Are Missing Out," "All the Ways Stock Market Bulls Have Gone Off the Rails. Again," and "China Trade War Walloped More Than Half of U.S. States in 2019."
Wage growth has been strong, and those with lower incomes have seen the largest percentage increases. But this decline in income inequality is no reason to celebrate at Bloomberg News, which frets, "In recent years, while high-school graduates have seen a sharp pickup in earnings, the lower-earning half of college graduates haven't -- and the gap between them is now the smallest in 15 years."
Bloomberg News also runs regular over-the-top opinion pieces criticizing Mr. Trump, with headlines such as: "An Unrestrained Trump May End Up Trapping Himself," "Trump Is Already Making Stuff Up About Voter Fraud," and "Trump's Tariffs Haven't Rescued American Steel." Again, all from a single weekend.
The value of these stories to Democrats in general, and to Mr. Bloomberg in particular, almost certainly exceeds Mr. Bloomberg's advertising expenditures. But there is no way that the government could or should police Bloomberg News's content for political bias.
Further, Bloomberg News's headlines and stories are not substantially different from those one finds in the Washington Post (owned by the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos), the New York Times (which is controlled by the Sulzberger family and for several years counted Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim as its largest shareholder), or most other traditional news outlets. Meanwhile, candidates operate under strict limits on contributions, making it difficult to counteract the influence of magnates with newspapers.
The whole saga illustrates the impossibility of putting government in control of campaign speech, and the unfairness that results from trying. Campaign finance laws don't equalize political influence -- they give an advantage to some of the richest and most powerful men in America.
Congressional Democrats have busied themselves with proposing constitutional amendments to overturn Citizens United. That's small beer. If Democrats want to make campaigns "equal," they'll have to repeal the First Amendment's guarantee of press freedom. I doubt they want to go that far.

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of sex crimes involving two women but acquitted of the most severe charges he faced, a mixed verdict that nevertheless means the Hollywood producer faces the prospect of a lengthy prison term and delivers a victory to the #MeToo movement.
The verdict on Monday completed a fall from grace for Mr. Weinstein, whose Oscar-winning movie empire crumbled after sexual-misconduct allegations emerged from several women, including famous actresses.
After nearly 20 hours of deliberation following a six-week trial in New York City, the jury found Mr. Weinstein guilty of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape, and acquitted him of first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault. He faces between five and 25 years in prison on the criminal sexual-act charge and up to four years for third-degree rape.
New York State Supreme Court Justice James Burke ordered Mr. Weinstein, 67 years old, jailed until he is sentenced on March 11.
After the verdict was read, Mr. Weinstein's defense counsel recounted, the producer said, "I'm innocent, I'm innocent, I'm innocent. How could this happen in America?"
Authorities booked him at the city's Rikers Island jail facility, where he was to be housed in the infirmary. The wrists of the once-powerful producer were handcuffed before he hobbled out of the courtroom, leaning on officers for support. Mr. Weinstein had used a walker during the course of the trial.
Later, Mr. Weinstein was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, said his attorneys, without disclosing the reason.
The trial marked the first serious legal test for the allegations that ignited the #MeToo movement in 2017. It presented jurors with difficult issues involving the nature of sexual consent, the fallibility of memory over several decades and how rape victims interact with abusers after alleged sexual misconduct.
In convicting Mr. Weinstein of third-degree rape, the jury found that Mr. Weinstein had sex with aspiring actress Jessica Mann against her will in 2013 but determined that he didn't use the physical force or threats of immediate harm required of first-degree rape. The first-degree criminal sex act conviction stemmed from accusations that he forced oral sex on production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006.
As recently as Friday, the jury had suggested it couldn't come to an agreement on the charge of predatory sexual assault, which carried the most severe penalty of life in prison. The panel ultimately found there wasn't enough proof to convict Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct with "The Sopranos" actress Annabella Sciorra at her New York City apartment in the early 1990s.
Dozens of women have accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct, but the prosecutors presented the testimony of just six, who were often in tears as they testified. In her closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi described Mr. Weinstein as an "abusive rapist" and "predator" who not only assaulted the victims but also tried to bully them into silence.
Mr. Weinstein's defense spent weeks subjecting 28 prosecution witnesses to grueling cross examinations. They sought to undercut the women's narratives by pointing to their longstanding relationships with Mr. Weinstein after the alleged assaults.
In New York, legal experts say Justice Burke is unlikely to sentence him to the maximum. Mr. Weinstein still faces a second prosecution, in California, for felony sex crimes. Los Angeles prosecutors charged him with raping a woman after pushing his way inside her hotel room on Feb. 18, 2013, and sexually assaulting another woman the next night. If convicted, he faces up to 28 years in prison.
The charges and trial represented a stunning turn for Mr. Weinstein, who was once viewed as one of Hollywood's most skilled executives. Following reports in 2017 in the New York Times and the New Yorker about the allegations, he was fired as co-chairman of Weinstein Co., his independent movie and television studio. He was known as the Oscar-winning orchestrator behind hits like "Shakespeare in Love" and "The King's Speech."
Mr. Weinstein had denied having any nonconsensual sexual encounters.
Jurors declined to comment. Annette Vasquez, one of three alternate jurors who didn't deliberate with the others, said she viewed the actions of Mr. Weinstein and his accusers as tit for tat -- they were "both looking for something" from each other.
The verdict marked a victory for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who was criticized for declining to prosecute Mr. Weinstein in 2015, when Italian model Ambra Gutierrez reported the producer groped her at his Tribeca office.
Mr. Vance said his office didn't have enough evidence to pursue what would have been misdemeanor charges then. "This case moved our understanding of what sexual assault is and where it can occur," the district attorney said Monday. "Rape is rape," he said.
After the verdict, Mr. Weinstein's defense team and civil-rights attorney Gloria Allred addressed reporters.
Lead defense attorney Donna Rotunno said Mr. Weinstein took the verdict "like a man."
His team plans to appeal.
Ms. Allred, who represented some of the accusers who testified, addressed the producer himself: "Harvey Weinstein, this justice has been a long time coming but it's finally here, and it's not the end."
Ms. Mann, now a 34-year-old hairstylist, testified about a violent rape at the hands of Mr. Weinstein in March 2013 at the DoubleTree hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Then an aspiring actress, she said Mr. Weinstein ordered her to remove her clothing and blocked her from leaving the hotel room. She said she was so scared, she gave up and he had sex with her.
Ms. Mann kept in touch with Mr. Weinstein, writing him a month after the DoubleTree incident: "I appreciate all you do for me, it shows."
Ms. Haley testified that Mr. Weinstein, who was helping her find work at the time, invited her to his SoHo apartment in July 2006. He kissed and fondled her before backing her into a bedroom and "forced himself on me orally," she testified.
She said she didn't file a police report because she think didn't it was an option against the powerful Mr. Weinstein. The day after the alleged assault, Ms. Haley flew to Los Angeles on a ticket that Mr. Weinstein bought for her. When she returned two weeks later, she met Mr. Weinstein at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, where the two had sex.
Prosecutors presented testimony from an expert who said the women's behavior was commonly seen in sexual-assault victims.
The only silver lining for Mr. Weinstein was the acquittal on predatory sexual assault, the most severe charge. The crime requires more than one incident, and the judge allowed prosecutors to charge Mr. Weinstein under the statute for Ms. Sciorra's allegations even though the statute of limitations made her case too old to prosecute on its own.

ELECTION 2020; The risky role of Sanders' surrogates; They're freewheeling, outspoken and not always on message.

Texto completo: When Bernie Sanders takes the stage or gets behind a microphone, he seldom surprises -- the presidential candidate's policy-heavy script is so familiar that crowds at his rallies often know what line is coming next.
Not so with his eclectic troop of surrogates.
"No, no, I'll boo," Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan declared from an Iowa stage a few weeks ago as a moderator tried to discourage booing when the name "Hillary Clinton" came up.

The incident -- which was followed by an online Tlaib apology -- created an awkward moment for Sanders, who has determinedly sought to position himself as presidential: above petty attacks and conspiracy mongering.
That task is made more complicated time and again by his field lieutenants.
No other campaign has so many big personalities empowered by the candidate. They include the filmmaker Michael Moore and actors Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. Activist and scholar Cornel West is routinely on the trail berating the "milquetoast neo-liberalism" of the Democratic Party, and "Sex and the City" star Cynthia Nixon recently joined the roster.
Their sometimes startling riffs and freewheeling broadsides against the establishment have played a large role in swelling the Sanders movement. But as Sanders has moved from an outsider candidate to the front-runner and potential nominee, his campaign now must grapple with whether to infuse some message discipline into the mix.
"The more he consolidates his front-runner position, Bernie is going to have to realize he has to reach out to the rest of the party to be able to unify and lead it," said Mark Longabaugh, who was an advisor to Sanders in his 2016 presidential run. "He needs to be careful that his surrogates reflect that effort."
The surrogates are showing no sign of toning it down.
"I'm a black woman in America, and I do have a thought outside of what I do for Sen. Sanders," campaign co-chair Nina Turner said Thursday in a brief interview in Las Vegas.
She had just been asked about a South Carolina op-ed she wrote that accused former Vice President Joe Biden of having "repeatedly betrayed" black Americans. Sanders had to distance himself from the article during a televised debate.
Turner is a master orator and a crowd favorite who can energize a room better than most anyone on the stump, candidates included. But she's not always in lockstep with the campaign.
The senator also found himself keeping his distance from her when she charged that Democratic Party officials had timed their call for a recanvass of caucus results in Iowa to hurt Sanders.
"That's not my impression at this point," Sanders said when asked on CNN if he believed the same.
Renegade surrogates are certainly not unique to Sanders. For as long as campaigns have been deploying surrogates -- the practice goes back at least to the days of William McKinley, a poor speaker who in 1896 dispatched 1,400 more charismatic speakers to campaign for him -- surrogates have been adding heartburn to presidential bids.
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright famously caused a stir in the last cycle by declaring, "There's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other," as she introduced Clinton at a New Hampshire rally during her 2016 primary versus Sanders. Outrage followed.
Days later, Albright wrote a New York Times op-ed titled "My Undiplomatic Moment."
Even in 2016, however, the Sanders stable of surrogates more persistently drew awkward headlines. There was the moment Robbins belittled the entire state of South Carolina, calling victory there as significant as winning Guam. Sarandon's "I don't vote with my vagina" remark was not all that helpful, nor was rapper Killer Mike declaring "a uterus doesn't qualify you to be president of the United States."
This year, all three are back on the campaign trail with Sanders.
"Bernie's fiery, passionate surrogates are powerful because they have their own following of people who know they are going to speak their mind," said Krystal Ball, a progressive strategist who co-hosts "Rising," an online broadcast popular with Sanders supporters.
"It is worth any potential blowback created for views not shared by Bernie. These are authentic voices vouching for him."
Other campaigns may keep a tighter grip, Ball said, but "I don't think that caution serves them. It is not in touch with the times we are living in. It is the difference between a movement and a traditional campaign."
In the days leading up to the Sanders victory in New Hampshire, surrogates were a big draw at his events. Michael Moore enthralled a packed Rochester Opera House with a 25-minute riff that bounced from media incredulity at Sanders' success to Pete Buttigieg's cartoon-watching habits to a comparison between Sanders and Jesus.
Volunteer door-knockers packed into a field office to hear West, who most certainly did not follow a script.
"It's hard to find more humanity on the canvas than Rembrandt," he said, to vigorous nods and some confusion. "'The Jewish Bride.' You all know 'The Return of the Prodigal Son.' All those great paintings. It's very much about what this campaign is about: the deep human connection and wanting to be a force for good."
He then ricocheted into his bleak forecast for the Democratic National Convention in the summer: "When we get to Milwaukee -- whooo!" he said. "The Holy Ghost is going to have to hold my reins. I might be a Christian, but I am not a pacifist."
Premium ice cream slingers Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield joined Sarandon to scoop Cherry Garcia for students at Colby Sawyer College and offered a side of sexual innuendo.
"Feb. 11 is going to come around, and you are thinking: 'Hey, I've got a chance for a hot date' ...Vote? Hot date? Vote? Hot date?" Cohen said. "Take your date to the polls, and do it in the booth for Bernie. Do it in the booth for Bernie! Do it in the booth for Bernie!"
At one of the larger rallies in New Hampshire, writer and activist Shaun King was very much on point with the campaign in an eloquent tribute to Sanders' work in the civil rights movement and his authenticity.
But a conspiracy theory King amplified days later to his large social media following was another matter. King suggested that the Buttigieg campaign could have had a hand in the vote counting mishaps in Iowa.
"These kind of things become a larger and more meaningful headache as the Sanders campaign moves toward trying to unite the party around him as the front-runner," said Dave Karpf, a political scientist at George Washington University who focuses on grass-roots movements.
The off-script musings play well among die-hard Sanders supporters, he said, but risk repelling the voters the senator still needs to lure his way.
"Sanders having to spend time and energy walking back and correcting something a surrogate said doesn't help him emerge as a consensus front-runner," Karpf said.

Texto completo: Valley News Staff Writer
A recent headline in the New York Times read “Why Are You Still Packing Lunch for Your Kids?” In a week that also included coverage of the New Hampshire primary, essays about Valentine’s Day and updates on the Roger Stone scandal, the mildly confrontational title seemed to get people’s attention. More than 1,000 readers left comments.
In the article, author Jennifer Gaddis urges middle- and upper-class families to support efforts to make school lunches healthier by letting their kids buy lunch at school. School cafeterias are making big strides in the arena of nutrition, she said, but they need buy-in from families who can afford to pay full price in order to reach their full potential.
Gaddis, an assistant professor of civil society and community studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the author of The Labor of Lunch: Why We Need Real Food and Real Jobs in American Public Schools, estimates that about 20 million students, primarily from higher earning families, forgo cafeteria meals in favor of lunches brought from home. Despite major overhauls of lunch programs nationwide, including robust farm-to-school initiatives in many districts, those numbers haven’t changed much in recent years, she said. Presumably, families who have time to fret over what their kids are eating and money to buy the highest quality food still don’t have faith in school lunch.
But might there be another key reason kids are bringing lunches from home?
School staff may have figured out a way to pack more nutrients into school lunches, but they haven’t yet figured out a way to pack more minutes into the school day. So, while the contents of their cafeteria trays may have changed, students still face a time crunch when it comes to eating lunch.
The average school lunch period is 25 minutes for elementary schools and 30 minutes for middle and high schools, according to the School Nutrition Association. Not so bad, until you consider that the period is usually calculated from the time one class dismisses to the time the next one begins. Depending on the size of the school and other factors, students may have considerably less time in the lunch room than the bell schedule indicates.
If they have to contend with a long lunch line, students have even less time to eat. Given the choice, some are probably going to opt for more time at the lunch table. As the quality of school lunches improves, lunch programs may even be facing a paradox: Better food may increase participation, but in doing so it will create longer lines, which could swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
Upper Valley schools seem to be about on par with the national average when it comes to school lunch periods, with a low of 22 minutes and a high of 30 minutes. What that translates to in terms of actual eating time is hard to say, but some administrators and food services directors are trying to find ways to maximize the time they have.
At White River Valley School, which has a 35-40% average participation rate in the lunch program, the younger grades have started picking up their lunches from the cafeteria and then eating them in their classrooms, said Willy Walker, food service manager for both the South Royalton and Bethel campuses.
“We find they do a better job of eating in smaller groups,” Walker said. “The teacher can kind of drive the conversation.”
Students in grades three through five eat in the cafeteria directly after recess. Middle school students get 30 minutes for lunch, with a little bit of gym time built into the lunch period. Those strategies allow kids to burn off some energy and socialize with friends — and maybe work up an appetite — so they’re more focused on their midday meal, Walker said.
The length of the lunch line varies, depending on what’s on the menu. Kids can usually sail through the line on a salmon patty day, while “pizza day is over the top,” Walker said. The average amount of time spent in line is probably six or seven minutes, he said.
Fresh Picks Cafe, which contracts with several area schools to provide meals, is working on streamlining lunch lines to reduce wait times, said Jordan Roberts, food service director for Mascoma Valley Regional School District, one of Fresh Pick Cafe’s clients.
“When I was in high school, we had about five minutes to eat,” he said. “If you were in the back of the line, you were out of luck.”
Although students still don’t have a leisurely lunch period — lunch period at Indian River Middle School, for example, is 25 minutes — Roberts thinks technology and a concerted effort to be more efficient have afforded them a bit more table time. “The kids typically zip right through the lines pretty quickly,” he said.
At the same time, though, it’s never been easier to pack a healthy lunch. In her article, Gaddis paints a picture of affluent parents crafting Instagram-worthy lunches from farm-fresh produce. But they aren’t the only ones packing lunches. Grocery stores and co-ops brim with products designed for busy families who care about nutrition and have just a bit of extra cash to spare: pre-cut vegetables and fruit, single-serving tubs of hummus, peanut butter and guacamole, pre-cooked, all-natural chicken, drinkable yogurt and on and on.
Sure, school lunch is a bargain even for families who don’t qualify for free- or reduced-price lunch, but in some cases, an extra dollar or so per day and a couple of minutes invested in tossing prepackaged foods in an insulated lunch bag may buy students adequate time to actually eat their lunches and maybe even socialize with their friends.
Investing in quality food is one way schools are providing an equal education for students. But if they’re not giving young people adequate time to eat and socialize, they’re missing an important element of a quality meal.
Why are parents till packing lunches for their kids? Maybe it’s because their days are overpacked.

STUCK ON THE ISLAND OF MISFIT DEMOCRATIC ELITES CAN BERNIE SANDERS REPRESENT A PARTY WHERE THE BOSSES DON'T WANT HIM AS A MEMBER?

Texto completo: We've all laughed at the self-deprecating Will Rogers quote: "I don't belong to any organized political party. I'm a Democrat." It's a funny line because we recognize that there's an element of truth in it.
Less well known is Rogers' observation contrasting the nature of America's two major parties: "Democrats never agree on anything," he said in another Depression-era aphorism. "If they agreed with each other, they'd be Republicans."
As a party, Democrats are an amorphous coalition of interests and identities that, at its best, reflects the nation's ongoing diversity. The Democrats of the 1920s and '30s that Rogers cheekily counted himself among wouldn't recognize the party today and would probably be scandalized by it.
That's because the DNA of the Democratic Party changes and mutates with each generation as it attempts to become more inclusive. As Democrats embraced the New Deal, government expansion, intervention into markets, women's rights and full civil and voting rights for blacks, it attracted the support of immigrants, working-class people, young whites and minorities.
During the early-to-mid 1960s, most of the highest-ranking Democrats in the U.S. Congress were avowedly racist and had used their enormous clout to blunt the advance of civil rights legislation for decades. But the masses of potential black voters in the far more populous North made ignoring their interests in claiming rights already guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution untenable.
President Lyndon Johnson knew that supporting and signing civil rights legislation would alienate key members of the Democratic establishment and concede the once solidly Democratic South to Republican control for generations.
Richard Nixon's cynical "Southern strategy," which consisted of scaring working-class and rural whites about black progress during his 1968 presidential run, confirmed Johnson's fear of future Republican electoral routs. Dixiecrats and pro-segregation Democrats moved into the GOP column over the next decade, completely flipping historic sympathies that had identified the two parties since the Civil War.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s last year on Earth consisted of opposing the Democratic establishment's incremental approach to civil rights after LBJ publicly broke with him after he criticized the Vietnam War.
MLK's calls for a massive reorganization of the American economy at the expense of the military budget made him a pariah even among the civil rights establishment.
As much as he appreciated both the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts, MLK was convinced that only sustained and systemic structural change could make a meaningful difference in American life. He was in the early stages of proposing a grand alliance across class and race when an assassin's bullet took his life.
In death, MLK's reputation was rehabilitated by Democrats who feared him and Republicans who loathed him. For decades, it was difficult to stumble across anything he said after his 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech. MLK's later calls for reparations and a radical reallocation of billions of federal dollars to address America's problems were expunged from the record.
I've been thinking a lot about MLK and his final days recently because of the enormous freak-out the Democratic establishment is undergoing thanks to Sen. Bernie Sanders' victories in New Hampshire and Nevada.
Like MLK, Mr. Sanders is calling for dramatic change to the system that feels like a cut-and-paste of the civil rights leader's agenda in some places. But unlike MLK during his last year of life, Mr. Sanders is enormously popular and has amassed a movement that appears willing to go to the polls and vote for him. This is what terrifies the Democrats, despite the lip service it pays to MLK's ideas.
In recent days, Mr. Sanders has had his Nevada caucus victory compared to the 1940 Nazi invasion and occupation of France, and members of his campaign staff described as an "island of misfit black girls" by two "liberal" talking heads on what is ostensibly the liberal cable news network.
Practically every day on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," Democratic establishment pundits talk openly about what it will take to stop Mr. Sanders from getting the nomination. Their hysteria is officially over-the-top and a sign of how out of step they are with the people who actually matter most - the voters.
On Monday, host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican turned independent, called for Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar to drop out so that someone from the Three B's - Biden, Buttigieg or Bloomberg - can step up and consolidate the "stop Bernie" vote before it's too late. Left unexplained by the cable TV host is why he believes followers of the two senators would necessarily join such an effort instead of throwing their votes behind Mr. Sanders.
Personally, I'm a much bigger fan of Ms. Warren than I am of Mr. Sanders, but I will gladly vote for Mr. Sanders in a head-to-head against Donald Trump in November. I believe most of my fellow Americans would, too, including voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida.
Why Democratic elites and many liberal pundits tend to endlessly engage in shortsighted attempts to derail the popular will in the party is a mystery. While millions of Democrats express their desire to see significant change, a coterie of party insiders are always there to say "no" by attempting to put their thumb on the scale instead of letting a race play itself out. Given the disaster that 2016 turned out to be because of journalistic malpractice, it should at least be incumbent on the media to have a little humility and refrain from trying to manufacture outcomes. Let the people vote.
From where I sit, the Democratic Party elite has a terrible track record. It doesn't really know what it takes to win a national election. It has consistently misjudged what its most motivated voters want and is just as likely to use fearmongering about Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as its Republican counterparts, which is amazing.
Groucho Marx once said: "All people are born alike except Republicans and Democrats." As reluctant as I am to contradict the almighty Groucho, I would amend his aphorism to say: "All people are born alike, especially Republican and Democratic elites."

Texto completo: At the height of the bicycling craze in the 1890s, Boston was home to two trailblazing female cyclists: Kittie Knox, who broke racial barriers to compete, and Annie Londonderry, who gained international fame for embarking on an epic bike ride around the world.
And they both lived in the same neighborhood: the West End.
“They lived just a few blocks from each other, at the same time," said author Lorenz J. Finison, who has written two books about Boston's cycling history.
The fascinating stories of how these two female cyclists overcame discrimination and challenged the status quo are highlighted in a new exhibit called “Cycling Legends of the West End," which runs through May 30 at the West End Museum.
Several programs are complementing the exhibition. On Saturday, a reception will be held in the afternoon followed by a “West End Heritage Night" celebrating the life of Kittie Knox and her contributions to the sport of cycling.
Knox “confronted racism head-on" and “promoted women's independence ... by daring to don pantaloons while riding instead of the heavy, long skirts of her day," museum officials said in a press release. “She bravely challenged race and gender roles in cycling, forever changing its future and advancing equality for African Americans and women alike."
Born in Cambridge in 1874 to a Black father and a white mother, Knox was a seamstress and an accomplished cyclist who belonged to the League of American Wheelmen (also known as LAW).
When some chapters of LAW sought to ban Black cyclists from joining the league, Knox didn't back down. In 1895, she attended the league's national meet in Asbury Park, N.J., where she did not exactly receive a warm welcome.
“There was quite a bit of controversy at that summer meet in Asbury," said Finison.
Knox got turned away from hotels, but eventually found a place to stay and made her presence known throughout the meet. She made national headlines for challenging the league's “color bar."
“This afternoon Miss Knox did a few fancy cuts in front of the clubhouse and was requested to desist," the New York Times reported on July 9, 1895. “It is thought that this episode will result in temporarily opening the color line question."
On July 10, 1895, the San Francisco Call ran a story about Knox attending the meet and how league officials refused to give her a credential badge. “When Miss Knox, whose appearance and dress had been objects of admiration all day, walked into the committee-room at the local clubhouse and presented her League card for a credential badge, the gentleman in charge refused to recognize the card, and the young woman withdrew very quietly. Ninety-nine out of every hundred members interviewed express the heartiest sympathy for her and condemnation of the hasty action of the badge committee."
According to that story, one LAW official from Boston said he “considered the refusal entirely unwarranted."
Finison said Knox stayed at the meet and even danced at the evening ball.
About two weeks later, Knox's name and the issue of race came up in the July 26, 1895 edition of the LAW Bulletin. In the Q and A section of the league's weekly journal, a member asked: “How can a negro be a member of the L.A.W. as it appears Miss Knox of Boston is?" In response, league officials said: “Miss Katie J. Knox joined the League, April 1, 1893. The word 'white' was put into the constitution, Feb. 20, 1894. Such laws are not and cannot be retroactive."
Today, Knox is viewed as a hero. Just last month, the Smithsonian Libraries highlighted some of her accomplishments in a series of tweets, noting that “she continued to participate in meets around the country" and “helped democratize cycling - for both women and cyclists of all races."
Around the same time, another West End woman was gaining international fame as she pedaled around the world. Annie Cohen Kopchovsky, who used the alias Annie Londonderry, was a Latvian/Jewish immigrant who lived on Spring Street in Boston's West End. In June 1894, she bid goodbye to her husband and three young children and embarked on an epic bike ride around the globe that took 15 months to complete.
She earned money during the trip by pinning advertisements to her clothes.
At one point on her journey through France, she said three masked men tried to rob her. According to her story in the San Francisco Examiner, the robbers knocked her off her bike and she was thrown down to the ground. That's when she pulled out a revolver from the holster on her belt and aimed it at her assailants. One of the men backed off but another got behind her and grabbed her throat. She said they wrestled the weapon from her hands and rifled through her pockets, but she only had three francs, and she managed to escape.
“The fall from the wheel sprained my ankle and my shoulder was bruised considerably, but I had enough vitality left to continue the journey," she told the San Francisco Examiner.

Texto completo: For the women who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, the moment was stunning.
“This is a huge day. I'm crying right now because I expected the worst," said Zoë Brock, an actor who feared Weinstein might not only be acquitted but also make a comeback in Hollywood. “But now Harvey Weinstein is a convicted rapist and right now he's sitting in Rikers jail and I am so happy about it."
True, he was not convicted of the most serious charges of predatory sexual assault, which could have sent him to jail for life. But the once-mighty Hollywood producer is facing 5 to 25 years in prison, convicted of third-degree rape of one woman and criminal sexual assault of another.
The jury believed the women — despite a lack of testimony from police and despite withering cross-examination by Weinstein's lead lawyer, Donna Rotunno, who cast his accusers as opportunistic players in a Hollywood drama where everybody understood the dirty rules.
“The arguments that Harvey's lawyer made didn't land well for the jury. They were antiquated arguments that involved a lot of victim-blaming and tried to portray Harvey as the victim of these wily women," said Debra Katz, a lawyer who represented one of the women who testified. “He was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood who was very skilled at being a predator and choosing his victims, and the jury was just no longer going to give him a pass by saying this is transactional or this is the casting couch culture."
To those who weren't closely following the trial in New York, Weinstein's conviction may have seemed like a foregone conclusion. He was, after all, the one whose behavior launched the #MeToo movement in October 2017, after The New York Times revealed endemic claims of sexual misconduct against him. In all, 109 women publicly accused Weinstein of allegations ranging from sexual propositions and forced massages to rape.
But the criminal trial relied on the claims of just six women and only those allegations that were recent and sturdy enough to be brought into criminal court in New York.
And it followed a familiar timeworn course for sexual offenses: Blaming and shaming the victims.
Take what the defense did to the actor Annabella Sciorra, whose testimony did not produce convictions. Since her alleged rape occurred too long ago to meet the statute of limitations, she testified to bolster two charges of predatory sexual assault, which requires proof of a pattern of two or more assaults. Sciorra said Weinstein shoved his way into her Manhattan apartment, forced her onto her bed and raped her, while she punched and kicked him, the Times reported.
Still, Sciorra faced scrutiny about the choices she had made. Why had she opened her door to Weinstein in the first place? Why didn't she escape him? Had she tried to scratch him or to poke him in the eyes? Did she complain to the doorman who had let him into her building?
Rotunno even suggested that with her story, Sciorra was seeking a measure of fame she no longer enjoyed as an actor.
“Now she is the darling of a movement," Rotunno said.
As noted in The Atlantic, the defense even shamed Sciorra's friends. One was asked what she did to help after learning Sciorra had started cutting herself in the aftermath of the assault. Didn't she call a doctor? When actor Rosie Perez testified that Sciorra had confided in her about the alleged rape, she was asked whether she went to see her right away.
“They were the ones that were on trial," said actor Louise Godbold who was among the so-called “Silence Breakers" who reported Weinstein, and who spoke to the media about the verdict on a conference call Monday. “They were the ones whose phones were seized, whose every last photograph and e-mail was scrutinized, their medical records, scrutinized. Harvey didn't have to go through that. How is that fair? We have to look at the way that we press charges, the way that we conduct these trials, to find a way that is less traumatizing so that more sexual assault survivors will have the courage to come forward."
To Weinstein's defense team, it was as if the past two years and 20 weeks had never happened. Weinstein's lawyers tried to shred the credibility of Weinstein's accusers, not just by casting doubt on their allegations but by portraying them as the manipulators and using their interactions with Weinstein against them.
Jessica Mann, the actor Weinstein was convicted of raping, had to admit she maintained ties and even had consensual sex with Weinstein later. She also acknowledged she had been sexually abused before she met Weinstein, prompting her to break down in court, according to the Times. Even after she left the courtroom, she could be heard screaming from a back room. Mimi Haleyi, the former movie production assistant Weinstein was convicted of sexually assaulting, had to testify that Weinstein forced oral sex on her, though she had her period. And she, too, acknowledged that she later had consensual sex with Weinstein.
Despite the women's complicated testimony, the jury believed them.
“This was such a narrow legal hallway to walk down, and many of us really braced ourselves for a not-guilty verdict," said journalist Lauren Sivan, who was among those who accused Weinstein of misconduct. “It really shows that victim-shaming will not work anymore as a defense. There's no such thing as a perfect victim. Rape is rape no matter the victim's behavior, what they wore, what they did."
Rotunno had already revealed her philosophy on The New York Times's podcast The Daily, when reporter Megan Twohey asked whether she herself had ever been sexually assaulted.
“I have not," Rotunno said. "Because I would never put myself in that position." She was trying to fault the women who had gone to Weinstein's hotel room. But outside of court, it was a stunningly tone-deaf utterance that merited its own hashtag — #WhereIPutMyself — that survivors of sexual violence began posting on Twitter, along with details of where they'd been raped.
“In a sleeping bag, trying to go to sleep in my cabin at summer camp," one wrote.
“I was walking across the street to get a sandwich," wrote another. That was what the #MeToo movement should have taught us: That this happens everywhere. That women shouldn't be treated as prey in their workplace, that they are fending off lesser Weinsteins not only on casting couches but in insurance offices and in diners and in factories around the world. The jury seemed to take that lesson.

Texto completo: The split decision followed complicated testimony from accusers. It was a blow to the defendant and a win for Manhattan's district attorney.
It may have been a split decision, and Harvey Weinstein may have been acquitted of the most serious charges in the case. But the stunned expression on his face after the jury's verdict came in and he was placed in handcuffs on Monday made clear that it was a devastating blow.
On the other side, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, could take pride in even a partial win against Mr. Weinstein after coming under heavy criticism for declining to prosecute the once-powerful producer at an earlier opportunity.
Mr. Weinstein was convicted on two of five charges -- first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape -- and acquitted on the others, including first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault. Such divided verdicts are not uncommon.
Mr. Weinstein, 67, faces a minimum of five years in prison when he is sentenced by Justice James M. Burke, of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, at a hearing set for March 11. Justice Burke could sentence Mr. Weinstein to up to 29 years in prison, if he hands down the maximum sentence on the two guilty counts and orders the terms to be served consecutively.
Here are a few takeaways about what Monday's verdict.
The jurors fully believed the prosecution's first main accuser, Miriam Haley.
When Ms. Haley, a former production assistant on the television show "Project Runway," testified in January, she told a harrowing story about how Mr. Weinstein had dragged her toward the bedroom of his Lower Manhattan loft after she went there to meet with him one night in July 2006. She said that she tried to avoid his advances by saying that she was menstruating, but that Mr. Weinstein had held her down and forcibly performed oral sex.
The jury's decision to convict Mr. Weinstein of first-degree criminal sexual act based on this account was significant because Ms. Haley's testimony was far from ideal. She acknowledged that she had stayed in touch with Mr. Weinstein after that night and that she had gone to see him at the TriBeCa Grand Hotel two weeks later and had wound up having sex with him.
Under cross-examination, Ms. Haley said that even though she was sobbing during the second sexual encounter, she "didn't physically resist."
The split decisions on the two rape charges may have hinged on the question of physical force.
Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actress, told the jury an equally complicated story. During her testimony, she described in graphic detail how after injecting his penis with an erection medication, Mr. Weinstein cornered her in the bathroom of a Manhattan hotel room and raped her.
Like Ms. Haley, Ms. Mann acknowledged that she had kept in touch with Mr. Weinstein after the assault she described and also had consensual sex with him.
The jurors convicted Mr. Weinstein of the third-degree rape charge, which involves an assailant having sex with someone without consent, in connection with her account. But they acquitted him of first-degree rape, which required proving that "forcible compulsion" was used in the attack.
The split decision suggested that while the jurors believed Ms. Mann did not overtly consent to the sexual encounter with Mr. Weinstein, they did not believe that she had been physically forced into it.
Annabella Sciorra's testimony did little to help the prosecution.
Breaking down in tears at times, Ms. Scirorra told the jury that Mr. Weinstein pushed his way into her Gramercy Park apartment in the winter months of 1993 or 1994 and raped her as she kicked and punched him in a bid to escape.
Under New York's statute of limitations, Ms. Sciorra's account was too old to prosecute as a separate crime. But her story was used to charge Mr. Weinstein with two counts of sexual predatory assault, which involves an assailant attacking at least two different victims.
The jurors acquitted Mr. Weinstein of both predatory assault charges, the most serious counts, with each carrying a maximum penalty of life in prison.
It remains unclear why the jury acquitted Mr. Weinstein on the charges, but Ms. Sciorra's account was problematic in its own ways.
She acknowledged, for instance, that she could not recall precisely which month, or even year, the assault she described had had taken place. Mr. Weinstein's lawyers also elicited testimony from one of Ms. Sciorra's old friends, Paul Feldsher, who said that shortly after the incident Ms. Sciorra had not described it as a rape but as a "crazy thing" she had done with Mr. Weinstein. The defense also called the manager of Ms. Sciorra's building, who said that Mr. Weinstein would not have been allowed up to her apartment without her permission.
The verdict was a victory for the Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., the Manhattan district attorney.
Although the jury acquitted Mr. Weinstein of more charges than he was convicted on, the verdict was a significant accomplishment for Mr. Vance and his office, which took a huge risk in bringing Mr. Weinstein to trial in the first place.
Mr. Vance, a Democrat who has long considered himself an ally of feminists, came under enormous pressure to bring a case against Mr. Weinstein after The New York Times and The New Yorker published bombshell articles in October 2017, that detailed the stories of scores of women who accused Mr. Weinstein of abuse and harassment reaching back to the early 1990s.
Mr. Vance was particularly susceptible to the pressure given his own history with sex-crimes cases.
In April 2015, his prosecutors declined to file charges against Mr. Weinstein after an Italian model, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, accused him of groping her during a business meeting at his Lower Manhattan office. With the help of detectives, Ms. Battilana Gutierrez later recorded Mr. Weinstein appearing to admit that he had touched her. Prosecutors decided that she was a problematic witness because she had given inconsistent accounts in a separate sexual assault case in Italy.
Four years earlier, Mr. Vance dismissed rape charges against another powerful man, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund at the time, after a hotel maid in Manhattan accused him of rape. Again, Mr. Vance's office said it had doubts about the woman's credibility: She had fabricated a story about a gang rape in her native Guinea.
After the verdict on Monday, Mr. Vance told reporters at a news conference, "It's a new day because Harvey Weinstein has finally been held accountable for crimes he committed."
The verdict may lead to change in the prosecution of complex sex-crimes cases.
Prosecutors have traditionally been averse to bringing rape cases in which witnesses admit to having sex consensually with their assailants at other times.
Rape can and does occur within continuing romantic relationships, like abusive marriages. But there are entrenched assumptions among prosecutors that jurors will view accusers in such cases as less credible, making them hard to prove and therefore only rarely pursued.
Employing a strategy that was used successfully at the second trial of the comedian Bill Cosby, Mr. Vance's prosecutors persuaded Justice Burke to let them introduce three additional witnesses whose accounts did not yield charges but bolstered their argument that Mr. Weinstein had engaged in a pattern of abusive behavior.
In another move that seemed to help their case, prosecutors called a forensic psychologist, Dr. Barbara Ziv, as a witness. In her testimony, Dr. Ziv told the jury that many rape victims maintain contact with their assailants after violent attacks in hopes of normalizing traumatic experiences.
The lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, also dealt head-on with the problematic accounts of Ms. Haley and Ms. Mann in her closing statement to the jury. Ms. Illuzzi noted that Mr. Weinstein purposefully remained in contact with his victims in order to control them.
This strategy, Ms. Illuzzi said, was "the mark of a predator."

The Weinstein jury's important breakthrough; The jurors understood that rape, violence and assault can take place in the context of continuing relationships.

Texto completo: The Harvey Weinstein jury verdicts leave us with one big question. How could the jurors find Weinstein guilty of rape in the third degree and criminal sexual assault, and yet acquit him of being a serial sexual predator? Don't the two convictions show that Weinstein was obviously guilty of the predatory sexual assault charges as well?
The ability of jurors to see through Weinstein's "blame the victim" defense was a great achievement. The rape and criminal sexual assault convictions mean Weinstein probably will go to prison for a long time. But the sexual predator charges were the only ones that carried a life sentence. Other charges loom in Los Angeles. In the meantime, what explains the mixed verdicts in New York?
The jury found Weinstein guilty of raping Jessica Mann and criminally sexually assaulting Miriam Haley. This was a considerable achievement, because juries in the past have bought the "blame the victim" defense Weinstein offered. Weinstein couldn't have raped Mann, or forced himself on Haley, his lawyers argued, since each kept in contact with him afterward. The implication was that no rape victim would do that. Nor supposedly would they have gone on to have consensual sex with him, or continued to send friendly emails, some even marked "lots of love," or still worked together on scripts.

Sexual assault cases in which the accuser has continued contact with the alleged perpetrator typically result in acquittal, if they are prosecuted at all. The New York Times described the district attorney's decision even to bring the case before a jury as "unusually risky" because Mann and Haley had continued communications and agreed to have sex with Weinstein after the assaults. The assumption is that jurors would find such circumstances too complicated to convict. The director of a Chicago group that supports victims of sexual assault said that trying such cases is "practically unheard of."
And yet, the Weinstein jury smartly saw through this defense. The prosecutor called experts to help jurors understand how rapists overwhelm their victims psychologically, as well as physically. Forensic psychologist Barbara Ziv testified that it is common for women not to report a rape to law enforcement, to deny, compartmentalize, or otherwise try to regain control by maintaining a relationship with their assailants. Rape victims behave in ways that are counterintuitive to a layperson's expectations. As Ziv testified at the Bill Cosby trial, "most women who were sexually assaulted by someone they know have subsequent contact with that individual." They undertake a "powerful job" to "normalize" their lives, which sometimes includes continuing to see their assailants, if he was a friend before the assault.
In the case of Weinstein, there was understandable fear that he would ruin the career prospects of any woman who went to the police. Haley explained that, instead of being pro-active, she wanted to "just put it away in a box and pretend like it didn't happen."
What the jury understood, by convicting Weinstein, was that all of us need to update our image of the rapist. Weinstein was a monster, but he wasn't the stranger in the bushes monster. He was the monster in the office, the hotel or the dorm, the one who is capable of committing rape in the context of ongoing relationships. For the jury to have understood this, and convicted Weinstein, is an important turning point.
Nonetheless, the jury stopped short of convicting Weinstein on the predatory sexual assault charges. Under New York law, the jury was asked to go through a complicated two-step process. First, jurors had to decide whether to convict Weinstein of the primary charges -- rape of Mann and criminal sexual assault of Haley. Once they found Weinstein guilty of those charges, the jury next had to consider whether to find the defendant also guilty of being a sexual predator. But this enhancement required evidence that Weinstein had raped or sexually assaulted at least a third person. Annabella Sciorra testified that she had been raped by Weinstein in the winter of 1993-94, which could establish the necessary pattern.
From notes they sent to the judge during deliberations, we can tell the jury clearly was reviewing and weighing Sciorra's testimony. But in one note, the jury asked why Weinstein had never been charged with raping Sciorra. The judge's response was not helpful: "You must not speculate as to any other charges that are not before you." It would have been clearer to explain that the statute of limitations prevented prosecution of Sciorra's allegations.
Here the jury may have gotten understandably confused. Even though they were not being asked to find Weinstein guilty of raping Sciorra, they nonetheless had to decide that he had in fact raped her if they were going to tack on a predatory sexual assault conviction to the rape and criminal assault counts related to Mann and Haley.
It may have seemed odd to jurors that they were being asked to punish Weinstein indirectly on the Sciorra case. The acquittal on predatory sexual assault should not diminish the importance of a verdict that shows jury trials can bring rapists to justice.

THE WEINSTEIN VERDICT; Wealth and power did not save him

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein had his walker in court on Monday but he did not walk.
At least not free.
In the minutes following Weinstein's conviction on two counts of rape and felony sexual assault, at least one on-air legal analyst was in the midst of discussing the possibility of bail when word came that Judge James Burke had ordered Weinstein to be taken into custody until his March 11 sentencing.

He was put in handcuffs, helped to his feet and led away. It may not be perfect justice -- he was found not guilty on two counts of predatory sexual assault -- but it was more than many hoped for a year ago, or even a few days ago when the jury revealed it was hung on two counts.
For the last six weeks, Weinstein entered that Manhattan courtroom supported by a walker and a career in which multiple accusations of rape and sexual assault had been silenced by threats, denials, character assassinations, monetary settlements and NDAs.
But on Monday, he left in handcuffs, flanked by two court officers and offering a new hope for those who have suffered sexual abuse at the hands of the rich and powerful. Weinstein stood convicted of raping Jessica Mann and of sexually assaulting Mimi Haley.
Two women who withstood hours of emotionally traumatic testimony, including often near-mocking questioning by defense attorney Donna Rotunno, who, during the trial, told "The Daily" podcast that she had never been sexually assaulted "because I would never put myself in that position." In case anyone thought we had advanced beyond "blame the victim" thinking in rape cases.
Two women who, as stand-ins for the more than 80 others who have accused Weinstein of sexual abuse, became the first to face a judge and jury in what has been characterized by some as "a witch hunt."
In case anyone thought modern society had rejected that any group of women making accusations about rich and powerful men were liars, crazy or, well, witches.
And yet, finally, it we have done both of those things. Or at least the seven men and five women who made up the jury did.
Weinstein's attorneys have vowed to appeal, but the tagline "he'll never do time" that has marked the list of accusations against Weinstein and others that have grown to horrifying #MeToo heights since the New York Times broke its first story about sexual harassment payouts has fallen into the gutter where it belongs.
Meanwhile, "his career is over," once considered the ultimate punishment for Weinstein and those accused in the #MeToo movement, has taken on a whole new meaning. Accusations of rape and sexual assault haven't just ended Weinstein's producing career; they've ended his career as a sexual predator as well.
When Weinstein was led out of court in handcuffs, his walker was left behind, along with all the other crutches that enabled him and others to attack with impunity for so long including "I would never put myself in that position" and "this is a witch hunt" mythologies, and the fear of retribution and an "army of lawyers" that appeared to put some men above the law.
Despite the retribution and an army of lawyers the eight women who testified faced, Weinstein was convicted anyway.
Although he was acquitted on three of the original five charges, the two felony convictions proved that "rape is rape ... no matter what," noted New York District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. after the verdict was announced.
More important, they proved that rape and sexual assault are crimes even if the victims did not immediately go to the police or their lawyers, even if they later exchanged friendly texts with their attacker . And that, more than any list of names and accusations, more than the removal of high-profile men from high paying jobs, more than any initiative or reacquaintance with sexual harassment policies, is what could make the world a better place.
Rape and sexual assaults are not, and have never been, HR issues, or two-sided battles of "she said, he said" semantics or "she should have known better" cultural perception.
Rape and sexual assault are criminal acts that cannot be turned into something else by money or rumor or time or the actions of the victim. Even when those actions include a continued relationship with the attacker.
Women's, and men's, bodies are not gray areas in which harm and violation are somehow erased by context or reaction or even perceived reparation. Just because you have silenced someone, by one means or another, into not reporting a crime does not mean the crime was not committed. Just because you have committed crimes without being punished for years does not mean they aren't crimes.Or that you will never be punished for them.
Weinstein leaned heavily on his walker in court and all his other crutches in Hollywood for decades, but in the end they didn't help. When the handcuffs were on, he had to walk to his cell alone and on his own two feet.

Texto completo: There has been a mass freak-out among the Democratic establishment as Bernie Sanders continues to surge in the polls. In two surveys released last week, the Vermont Senator has opened up a double-digit lead over his closest competitors in the Democratic primary.
The desperation has caused many Democrats to set their sights on former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg as the man who will save us all from Donald Trump. But first he'll have to save us from Bernie Sanders. The billionaire businessman has paid a pretty penny for every point he has risen in the national polls to overtake the prior moderate savior, Joe Biden.
For most of the primary season, politicos, commentators and journalists have dismissed the Sanders candidacy at best or attacked and misrepresented it at worst with the New York Times editorial board myopically comparing Sanders to Trump and calling his policy prescriptions "overly rigid, untested and divisive." How often do we hear it claimed with soothsayer certainty, "A Democratic Socialist will never be elected president in the United States?"
You know who else will "never" be elected president of the United States? A former reality TV star with zero governing or policy experience who attacks war heroes, the parents of war heroes, brags on tape about grabbing women by the p___y, and...well, you get my point.
The old rules simply do not apply, so we should stop using them.
It's true that at one point calling yourself a "Democratic socialist" would be a bridge too far for many voters, including Democrats. But that was before people began to realize how unmoored the American capitalist system is from any sense of ethics or morality. The level of economic inequality and suffering from lack of affordable health care, crushing debt, and a discriminatory and racist for-profit incarceration system in one of the world's wealthiest countries is astonishing. People are exhausted from working non-stop trying to just survive financially in a system that dangles the carrot of financial stability or wealth always slightly out of reach except for a favored few. Nothing about this is normal and that is fundamentally Bernie Sanders' so-called "radical" argument.
As Bernie's new foil, Bloomberg is waving the "moderate lane" banner of electability and claiming that Bernie's kooky notions (which are just considered normal behavior in many industrialized countries) go too far for American voters. These are the same voters who would cut off your hand if you reached for their socialist Medicare or Social Security. Still, the premise of Bloomberg as electable slipped seamlessly into the public debate. Of course, Bernie fares just as well, and sometimes better, than Bloomberg in hypothetical matchups against Trump but the electable moniker has mysteriously eluded him.
What ultimately will make the Democratic standard bearer electable is his or her ability to excite and turn out voters. This is why the most pertinent issue for Bernie's electability argument has been his weak history attracting African American support. While he made significant inroads since 2016, much of that critical voting bloc has been locked up with Joe Biden. But that is shifting. Last week's NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist found that Bernie has narrowed that gap to just three points, and he tops Bloomberg by 12 points.
Either way, it's hard to believe that the mayor who expanded "stop and frisk" in New York City and defended it all the way up to a month before he announced his candidacy is going to excite black voters, particularly young black voters who have made their preference for Bernie manifest. For that matter, why would any Democratic voter, regardless of their race, be excited about a candidate who lacked the imagination to grasp that being treated like a criminal just for existing would be a traumatizing experience for black and brown people?
Moreover, Bloomberg's performance in his first Democratic primary debate last week was imperious and underwhelming. He absurdly claimed that the NDA's women at his company signed were "consensual" and refused to agree to let them speak openly about their experiences working for his company. He stumbled through an explanation of stop-and-frisk claiming, "it got out of control," when he was the one who had total control over it. Responding to Bernie's contention that billionaires should not exist, Bloomberg claimed he is giving all his money away. But trying to buy your way into the presidency is not charity.
Whatever people's fears about Bernie's democratic socialism, the fact remains he's running for president, not king, of the United States. Some of his solutions are dead on and others less so. But he cannot enact any of them without the support of Congress. This means he will have to use his bully pulpit to bring the country around to his point of view if he wants to enact change. American voters are capable of grasping this.
It's well past time to bury the "Bernie is unelectable" trope.

Supreme Court Takes Up Abuse of No-Fly List Amid Claim of Religious Freedom

Texto completo: Three Muslim men say F.B.I. agents tried to use the list to coerce them into becoming informants, in violation of a federal law protecting religious freedom.
When F.B.I. agents asked Muhammad Tanvir to spy on his fellow Muslims, he turned them down. His faith, he said, did not allow him to become an informant.
The agents were persistent. According to a lawsuit filed by Mr. Tanvir, they cajoled him, threatened him and finally, in 2010, applied a novel sort of pressure: They put him on the No-Fly List, barring him from boarding any planes leaving from or landing in American airports. If he cooperated, the agents said, he would be allowed to fly again.
Next month, the Supreme Court will hear arguments about whether Mr. Tanvir and two other men with similar stories can sue the agents for violating a federal law protecting religious freedom.
The Trump administration, which in other settings has taken a broad view of the law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, has urged the court to dismiss the suit, saying it would interfere with "sensitive matters of national security and law enforcement."
Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at the City University of New York and a lawyer with a clinic there that represents Mr. Tanvir, said the case would test the court's commitment to religious liberty.
"Our clients were placed or kept on the No-Fly List not because they posed any threat to aviation security," Professor Kassem said, "but as a way to coerce them to become informants on their own communities."
Mr. Tanvir's case is at an early stage, and the justices must for now assume that his version of events, set out in his lawsuit, is true. The question for the court is whether Congress meant to allow suits like his at all.
A lawful permanent resident who lived in Queens, Mr. Tanvir worked as a long-haul truck driver. The job often required him to fly home after completing his deliveries. But when he tried to get on a flight in Atlanta in October 2010, his lawsuits says, he was turned away. Two F.B.I. agents drove him to a bus station, and it took him about 24 hours to get home.
Mr. Tanvir quit his job. On three occasions, he bought plane tickets to visit his mother in Pakistan, who was in failing health. He was not allowed to fly. Throughout, agents told him that they would help him get off the list -- if he cooperated.
The No-Fly List appears to include tens of thousands of people. The criteria for inclusion are opaque, making it subject to errors and abuse. Mr. Tanvir's lawyers say that he has never been arrested or charged with any crime and that he poses no threat to aviation safety.
Mr. Tanvir and the two other men sued the agents in 2013. A trial judge dismissed the case, but a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, revived it. The 1993 law, Judge Rosemary S. Pooler wrote for the panel, allowed Mr. Tanvir to seek money from the agents for the harm he had suffered.
The law was a response to a 1990 Supreme Court decision that declined to recognize religious exceptions to generally applicable laws. Congress effectively reversed that decision. "What this law basically says," President Bill Clinton said before signing the bill, "is that the government should be held to a very high level of proof before it interferes with someone's free exercise of religion."
Dissenting from the full Second Circuit's refusal to rehear the panel's decision, Judge Dennis Jacobs said the decision was "quite wrong and actually dangerous," sending an alarming message to law enforcement agents. "The safest course for a government employee in doubt," Judge Jacobs wrote, "would be to avoid doing one's job, which is not a choice in need of encouragement."
Judge José A. Cabranes, in a second dissent, said the Second Circuit had evaded, if not defied, Supreme Court precedents, and not for the first time.
In 2009, in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, for instance, the Supreme Court reversed a Second Circuit decision that had allowed a Pakistani Muslim man arrested after the Sept. 11 attacks to pursue a lawsuit against John Ashcroft, a former attorney general, and Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, for abuses he said he had suffered in a Brooklyn detention center.
Similarly, the Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit in 2017 in Ziglar v. Abbasi, ruling against Muslim immigrants who said they had been rounded up and subjected to beatings, humiliating searches and other abuses at the same detention center. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, acknowledged that the way the detainees said they had been treated was appalling. But he said lawsuits seeking money from government officials were not the right way to address asserted misconduct in the midst of a national security crisis.
Mr. Tanvir's lawyers say his case is different, because the 1993 law specifically authorizes lawsuits against government officials for "appropriate relief," which they say includes claims for money.
Prominent law professors and religious groups have filed briefs supporting Mr. Tanvir, but the earlier rulings suggest that he faces an uphill fight in his case, Tanzin v. Tanvir, No. 19-71.
In a Supreme Court brief, the administration urged the justices not to interfere with its efforts to protect the nation.
"The allegations in this lawsuit concern purported efforts by F.B.I. agents to obtain assistance from respondents in connection with investigations into potential terrorist or criminal activity, including by noncitizens," the brief said. "The investigations thus implicated both national security and immigration, core powers of the executive branch."

Texto completo: After months of resistance to discussing how he would pay for his plans like "Medicare for all" and canceling student debt, Mr. Sanders announced the explanation at a CNN event on Monday.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, under growing pressure to explain how he would pay for his very expensive policy agenda, released a checklist on Monday evening that he described as a full explanation of how he would finance all of his proposals.
The actual document is somewhat limited, and in some cases the revenue Mr. Sanders identifies doesn't match the costs of his plans.
For example, he estimated Sunday night on "60 Minutes" that the price tag for his "Medicare for all" plan would be about $ 30 trillion over 10 years, but the revenue he identifies for it in the new outline totals about $ 17.5 trillion. It is possible that the gap could be filled by existing appropriations for Medicare and Medicaid, but Mr. Sanders did not mention those in his outline or in the Sunday interview.
But his decision to release the outline at all is significant given his months of resistance to discussing precisely how he would pay for his plans. That has been a major source of criticism, especially in the past few weeks, as he has cemented himself as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.
He made the announcement Monday evening during a town hall-style event on CNN, where he was also pressed over his recent comments on Fidel Castro and the behavior of some of his supporters online.
After going largely unscathed in recent debates, Mr. Sanders is now facing the intense scrutiny that comes with being the front-runner, and the topics he confronted in the event on Monday are likely to come up again in Tuesday night's debate.
The criticism over his longstanding refusal to release full details of how he would pay for his plans has come not only from moderates who argue that his agenda is unaffordable, but also from supporters of his main progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
Ms. Warren released a comprehensive plan in November to pay for her own version of Medicare for all, and the resulting scrutiny of the details was a major factor in her campaign's decline. Mr. Sanders largely avoided that level of scrutiny by not releasing such extensive details.
His announcement on Monday came nominally in response to a question about whether his plan for free college was equivalent to President Trump's promise to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it: a rallying cry for supporters, but with no realistic path to happening.
But he had clearly anticipated an opportunity for the reveal, because he had a piece of paper ready to pull out of his pocket.
"I thought that question might come up. All right. Here it is," he said. "This is a list, which will be on our website tonight, of how we pay for every program that we have developed."
Within minutes, there it was.
Later in the forum, the most inevitable subject of the night came up: Mr. Sanders's declaration on "60 Minutes" on Sunday that, while he opposed the authoritarianism of Cuba's government, "it's unfair to simply say everything is bad."
"When Fidel Castro came to office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program," he said in that interview. "Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?"
Those comments angered many Cuban-Americans, who are a powerful voting bloc in Florida. Asked about his comments in the town hall on Monday, Mr. Sanders repeated the example of Castro's literacy program and said he had been "extremely consistent and critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world, including Cuba, including Nicaragua, including Saudi Arabia, including China, including Russia."
"I happen to believe in democracy, not authoritarianism," he said. But, he added: "China is an authoritarian country, becoming more and more authoritarian. But can anyone deny -- I mean, the facts are clear -- that they have taken more people out of extreme poverty than any country in history? Do I get criticized because I say that? That's the truth."
The moderator, Chris Cuomo, separately pushed Mr. Sanders on his recent argument that Russians might be behind at least some of the online harassment associated with his campaign. It emerged last week that Mr. Sanders had been briefed on Russian efforts to interfere on his behalf, and Mr. Cuomo asked whether evidence of Russians masquerading as Sanders supporters had been part of that briefing.
It was not, Mr. Sanders said, declining to elaborate on the contents of the briefing because it was classified. But, he continued, he thought it stood to reason that Russians might have been behind, for example, harassment of the Culinary Workers Union in Nevada after it criticized Medicare for all.
"I have perhaps the strongest lifetime pro-union voting record of any member of the Congress," Mr. Sanders said. "Does anybody really think anyone who's a supporter of mine, that they would make ugly attacks against really excellent trade union leaders? It just seemed to me kind of fishy."
He also reiterated what he has said in the past: that he did not want the support of online harassers.
"We do not want your support if you think that what our campaign is about is making ugly attacks on other candidates," he said. "We don't want you. You're not part of us."
But, he acknowledged, his campaign has millions of followers, "and I'm not going to tell you that we don't have some jerks out there."
South Carolina Newspaper Endorses Buttigieg
One of the largest newspapers in South Carolina, The State, endorsed Pete Buttigieg on Monday night in the upcoming primary. The newspaper, which is based in Columbia, S.C., the state capital, said "Democrats need a nominee who seeks to bring Americans together based on common ground -- and not divide them along narrow interests."
The newspaper's editorial board said that Democrats have won the presidency only during the past half century when they have eschewed the status quo in favor of centrist outsiders with fresh and hopeful messages. The endorsement said that Mr. Buttigieg brings a real world perspective as the former mayor of the Rust Belt city of South Bend, Ind., and said that Mr. Buttigieg's "Medicare for all who want it" plan was a key selling point that would allow people to keep their private health insurance if they still wanted it.

Texto completo: The Russians don't have to help President Trump or Bernie Sanders. They may already be winning.
Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.

Have the Russians already won?
That's the question my colleague Reid Epstein and I were discussing this morning as we looked at the presidential candidates' responses to a new series of reports over the past few days revealing, yet again, a campaign of Russian meddling in American elections.
Most of the specifics remain fairly hazy: A report on Thursday said intelligence officials had warned House lawmakers that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected. The next day, there was a report in The Washington Post that American officials had briefed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont a month ago that Russia was attempting to help his presidential campaign in the Democratic contest.
And then yesterday, intelligence officials disputed the reports about Russia's helping Mr. Trump, saying that House members might have misheard or misinterpreted the briefing, and that Russia was intervening in the election but not necessarily to help the president.
We don't know exactly what the Russians are doing or how they are doing it, though we can make some assumptions based on their 2016 effort, which many cybersecurity experts believe never stopped operating after the last election.
But we do know how some of the candidates have reacted to this serious threat to democracy: by adding to the confusion and disinformation.
Mr. Trump responded to revelations about the briefing with lawmakers by berating Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, then replacing him days later with Ambassador Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist with little experience in intelligence or in running a large bureaucracy. Later, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for spreading a "hoax."
Mr. Sanders, for his part, moved quickly to denounce Russia, calling President Vladimir V. Putin an "autocratic thug" and warning Moscow to stay out of the election. Yet, he has also alluded to the idea that there is a domestic conspiracy afoot, playing into the kind of theories Moscow is eager to promulgate to undermine the news media and our political system.
When asked why the disclosure about Russia's attempted assistance came out on Friday, Mr. Sanders said: "I'll let you guess about one day before the Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out? It was The Washington Post? Good friends."
The candidates are doing to one another what the Russians are trying to do to the election: weaponize the information. With Russia seemingly pulling levers from behind a curtain, they're attempting to create a narrative about whom Mr. Putin might support or oppose.
Mr. Trump suggested at a rally in Las Vegas that Mr. Putin would prefer Mr. Sanders, claiming that Mr. Sanders and his wife had "honeymooned in Moscow." (The couple did travel to the Soviet Union after their wedding, and have jokingly called the trip their honeymoon, but they had a more traditional honeymoon the next year in the Caribbean.)
Michael Bloomberg's aides made a similar argument: "Trump himself and now the Russians are indicating that Senator Sanders is the candidate they want to run against," Dan Kanninen, a campaign official, told reporters on Monday.
And Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said he had not been informed of any specific intelligence about Russia and his campaign, said he was the candidate Mr. Putin most hated.
"The Russians don't want me to be the nominee," he said on "Face the Nation." "They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook, and they've been taken down, saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running. They're not -- no one's helping me to try to get the nomination."
Turning disinformation into just another political football is exactly the kind of reaction Russia hopes to foster. The point of Moscow's campaign is not necessarily to help Mr. Trump or Mr. Sanders get to the presidency in 2020; it's to sow discord and undermine the institutions of American democracy, making presidential elections here seem no more credible than the ones keeping Mr. Putin in office.
One small solution might be to clarify the threat for voters by creating a protocol to monitor and notify both government agencies and the public about disinformation efforts -- similar to a system set up in Canada last year. Right now, most of the information coming out in public is through leaks to the news media, very likely for political gain. That gives voters little clear information about what to watch out for when they log onto Twitter or Facebook.
"What's so worrying to me right now are the unclear reports," said Laura Rosenberger, a former Bush and Obama administration official who now leads the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which works to counter foreign interference campaigns. "It's hard to even know the scale of the issue when we don't know really what the scope of the problem is."

How the early contests changed our readers' views on 2020
We asked you, On Politics readers, to tell us how the results in Iowa and New Hampshire affected your view of the race. And, boy, did you have thoughts!
For Barbara Sloan of Conway, S.C., the early results changed her view -- and vote.
"Living in South Carolina, I had expected Biden to do better and thought his candidacy might be inevitable," she said. "Obviously, Iowa and New Hampshire showed that is not the case. At the same time, I got to see more of Amy Klobuchar and she grew on me," Ms. Sloan continued. "This week, I voted in-person absentee for her in the South Carolina Democratic Primary."
For John Sanderson, the results raised his concerns about Senator Elizabeth Warren.
"I live in North Carolina, and I have never given Sanders or Buttigieg any chance whatsoever of winning here, and I still don't," he said. "I have also had serious doubts about Warren's chances all along, and her performances in Iowa and New Hampshire only reinforce my doubts about her electability overall." He said a Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar ticket might fare best.
Lydia Simmons of San Francisco said the early states underscored how quickly the race could change.
"New Hampshire could be considered a case study of why one result doesn't guarantee another," she said. "Amy Klobuchar did not stand out in Iowa. She came in fifth. One strong debate later, she came in third," she continued, adding that Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden could not be counted out. "Ultimately momentum needs to be maintained, and that requires strong performance in far more than two small states."
And Joyce Tarantino questioned why Iowa and New Hampshire have so much power, anyhow.
"To place such importance on having two small states, with a very small amount of delegates, and unrepresentative of the nation and the Democratic Party as a whole, being the first to vote cannot continue," she said. "We are wasting valuable time and financial resources at the early stage of a very important campaign with no discernible return on investment, except confusion."
... Seriously

Texto completo: Doctors at Yale New Haven Hospital object to exams that occur under anesthesia without the patient's knowledge. Also: Security for .org domains.
To the Editor:
Re "An Unsettling Practice" (Science Times, Feb. 18):
As obstetrician-gynecologists, we believe that it is our duty to serve and respect our patients. As physicians, we are dedicated to caring for women. As medical educators, we teach and model professionalism to our learners.
At our academic medical center, Yale New Haven Hospital, we have worked to educate faculty and trainees to ensure that patients are counseled about the care they receive and the team involved. We have established a process to guide physicians to obtain specific informed consent from a patient that discusses the role of learners.
Additionally, the consent process involves an explanation of the components of each procedure, including the role of pelvic examination under anesthesia (E.U.A.) as related to gynecological care. Consequently, the pelvic E.U.A. and its consent process educate students how transparent communication illustrates the respect and shared decision-making critical for the patient-physician relationship.
We are concerned that legislation under discussion in Connecticut regarding pelvic E.U.A. is an example of interference with the patient-physician relationship, and may stigmatize the female anatomy.
Our professional responsibility should equally address informed consent of all procedures, not simply those affecting one particular group or body part. This is an area of medical practice and ethics best addressed by the medical community through clear statements of principles and policies.
Institutions should clarify and improve existing consent processes to ensure that patients possess adequate, accurate information. But lawmakers should not specifically "exceptionalize" exams for women.
We caution against legislating the patient-physician relationship. As physicians, we take an oath to care for our patients; as medical educators, we commit to training the next generation of physicians. These are not competing obligations, but are synergistic to ensure that best practices are continued.

Keeping .org Domains Secure
To the Editor:
Re "The Shaky Future of .org Domains," by Josephine Wolff (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Jan. 27):
Let's remember that the internet was built by companies with the vision and resources to innovate. Indeed, .org was previously operated, successfully, by a for-profit company.
Ethos Capital's acquisition of Public Interest Registry, which runs .org, from the Internet Society means that the registry can invest more in its own operations and help more nonprofits be online. The Internet Society, which relies substantially on the registry's surplus income, will now have a predictable endowment of more than $ 1 billion to support its global efforts to make the internet more accessible and secure.
Ethos never said "it will continue to raise prices." It actually agreed to adhere to historical pricing policies -- lifted months before its offer -- and limit any increase to no more than 10 percent a year on average, which today equates to about $ 1, to keep .org affordable.
The registry does not "suspend domain names" under pressure from foreign governments; its anti-abuse policies focus on malware/spam or egregiously abusive content, like child sexual abuse. The registry's commitment to free speech will continue unabated.
Ethos is making these and other commitments legally binding and enforceable.
Ensuring the security, reliability and stability of .org is not the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers' "reasoning" but rather the legal standard under which it reviews changes of indirect control. ICANN cannot expand its limited mandate -- reflected in its bylaws and developed through a multi-stakeholder process -- because of external pressure. The registry will remain as secure as it is today.
Ethos's investment serves the public interest by strengthening .org for the future; hyperbole and hysteria do not.

Step 1: Raise $1 Billion for Club World Cup

Texto completo: Europe's top soccer teams, which once opposed an expanded club championship, recently held talks with FIFA about becoming partners in the event.
FIFA has turned to an American financial advisory firm to jump-start its efforts to secure the $ 1 billion it will require to successfully launch its inaugural 24-team Club World Cup next year.
Hiring the firm, the Raine Group, which has experience in closing deals in the sports sector, suggests that a tender process begun by FIFA in December has failed to secure a backer capable of meeting the organization's requirements to finance the 2021 Club World Cup, which was awarded to China last year.
Much of the money is needed to secure the participation of the top European clubs, which are seeking privileged status and would essentially become joint owners of the event.
Last month, leaders from a group of elite European clubs, including Liverpool, Juventus and Barcelona, traveled to FIFA's headquarters in Zurich. According to people familiar with their plans and a document summarizing their meeting obtained by The New York Times, they discussed the creation of a joint venture between FIFA and the European Club Association, a status that would elevate their interests above participating teams from soccer's five other regional confederations. The talks centered on financial incentives, and the possibility of including as many as 12 European teams, four more than the current format, which caps European involvement at eight.
Reaching agreement for the tournament has been a fraught process. The project has fractured the relationship between FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, and the head of European soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, and faced opposition from the sport's biggest clubs and leagues. FIFA wants its new tournament to eventually have a stature similar to the World Cup's, an aspiration that would threaten the status of UEFA's Champions League, which is currently the world's richest club championship.
Attempts by FIFA to close an agreement for the tournament in 2018 with a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank foundered when Infantino failed to get the support of the FIFA Council. At the time, several members of the FIFA board -- led by Ceferin -- complained of not being told enough information about the project. A FIFA analysis, reported by The Times in 2018, concluded the organization needed to raise $ 650 million to $ 1 billion for the tournament to be viable.
For Infantino, the stakes are high. As well as stoking tension with Ceferin, the discussions around new club arrangements -- which would prioritize Europe's involvement over clubs from the rest of the world -- have also led to a breakdown in relations between Infantino and Alejandro Domínguez, the leader of the sport in South America and a longtime Infantino ally.
Domínguez, annoyed at being sidelined when South American teams were among a group that met with Infantino, signed an agreement to work on joint projects with UEFA's Ceferin earlier this month. A few days later, FIFA scrapped a FIFA Council meeting set to be hosted by Domínguez in Asunción, Paraguay, where his organization, CONMEBOL, is based.
FIFA largely blamed costs for scrapping the event, but Domínguez reacted with fury, demanding, in a letter to FIFA, a detailed breakdown on how much FIFA spent to host similar meetings recently in India, Rwanda and China.
After finally bowing to the creation of the tournament, UEFA has so far stymied FIFA's efforts to secure the participation of the continent's top teams for the inaugural event next year. It has demanded the field should include winners of its second-tier Europa League competition, while FIFA wants only the continent's best teams.
The clubs are taking advantage of the tensions. As well as talking to FIFA about the quadrennial World Cup, Europe's biggest teams have also met with the American billionaire Stephen M. Ross, who is seeking to get them to commit more formally to an annual preseason tournament. Ross's company, Relevent Sports Group, has held talks with both UEFA and FIFA about securing their backing for an annual event in which participating clubs could secure about $ 10 million per tournament and an equity stake, provided they commit to several editions of the competition.
FIFA hopes the new revenue stream from an expanded Club World Cup will allow it to invest more in developing the game around the world. But the financial demands of the top teams could make that difficult: Those teams want a model similar to the Champions League, where more than 90 percent of the income is paid out in prize money.
Because of the early opposition to its project, FIFA has found itself in a hurry to get the financing it requires. Some groups that showed initial interest in the event, like Suning Holdings Group, which is based in China, owns the Italian team Inter Milan and is one of the biggest Chinese investors in soccer, declined to make an offer after complaining that there was a lack of detail in FIFA's tender request.
By hiring Raine to manage the process, FIFA is enlisting an organization well versed in securing deals for sports entities, and one with a presence in China. Led by the banker Joe Ravitch, the firm helped the English soccer champion Manchester City sell a stake worth $ 500 million to the American investment group Silver Lake Partners in November. And City's Premier League rival Chelsea has directed any parties interested in acquiring the club from its Russian owner, Roman Abramovich, toward Ravitch.

Texto completo: The authorities investigated Harvey Weinstein in 2015. He was indicted three years later, after a flood of public complaints.
Accusations of sexual misconduct had swirled around the film producer Harvey Weinstein in New York and Los Angeles long before he was on trial in Manhattan.
Here is a timeline of events in Mr. Weinstein's journey toward a verdict.
Prosecutors in Manhattan declined to prosecute Mr. Weinstein.
Ambra Battilana, an Italian model, told the New York City police that Mr. Weinstein groped her breasts during a business meeting at his office in Manhattan's TriBeCa neighborhood. The next day, working with investigators, Ms. Battilana visited Mr. Weinstein at the TriBeCa Grand Hotel and secretly recorded him apologizing for the encounter.
But after a two-week investigation by sex-crimes prosecutors, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., announced that the evidence did not support charging Mr. Weinstein with forcible touching, a misdemeanor.
Mr. Weinstein hired investigators to learn who was talking to reporters.
As reports began to circulate that journalists were looking into allegations that Mr. Weinstein mistreated scores of women over decades, the producer hired a private intelligence firm, Black Cube, to investigate what he described as "red flags" -- or people who he suspected were talking about him to reporters.
Among those people was Annabella Sciorra, an actress known for her work on "The Sopranos," who claims that Mr. Weinstein raped her at her apartment in Manhattan's Gramercy Park neighborhood in 1993 or 1994.
The Times and The New Yorker detailed accusations that Mr. Weinstein mistreated women.
The New York Times published an investigation detailing the accounts of several women who claimed that Mr. Weinstein abused or harassed them in incidents as early as 1990s.
Five days later, The New Yorker published an article about more women who were accusing Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct; it included Ms. Sciorra's account.
The articles added momentum to the #MeToo movement and put pressure on the authorities to investigate the producer. Within a month, the New York Police Department said it was developing a strong case against him.
New York's governor ordered a review of the decision to not charge Mr. Weinstein in 2015.
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo ordered New York State prosecutors to investigate why Mr. Vance declined to charge Mr. Weinstein in Ms. Battilana's 2015 case. It had recently become clear that Mr. Vance had taken campaign donations from some of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers.
The investigation placed Mr. Vance's decision-making in the spotlight.
Mr. Vance put a new prosecutor in charge of the investigation.
Mr. Vance replaced the veteran sex-crimes prosecutor initially assigned to investigate Mr. Weinstein with a senior homicide prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi. The personnel change reflected a tension between the Police Department and the district attorney's office over how to handle the case.
Mr. Weinstein was arrested.
Mr. Weinstein was indicted and surrendered at the First Precinct station house in Lower Manhattan on charges of rape and criminal sexual act.
The rape charge stemmed from an alleged assault on an unnamed woman at the Doubletree Hotel in Midtown Manhattan in 2013. She was later revealed to be Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress from a small town in Washington State.
The criminal sexual act charge involved Lucia Evans, a marketing executive who told investigators that Mr. Weinstein forced oral sex during a casting meeting in his TriBeCa office in 2004.
Mr. Weinstein's then-lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, set the tone for his defense by saying that while he might have engaged in "bad behavior," he had not committed any crimes.
Prosecutors added charges.
Manhattan prosecutors announced they were adding charges to Mr. Weinstein's indictment.
The new charges were related to accusations of forced oral sex at his TriBeCa apartment in July 2006 on an unnamed woman. She was later identified as Miriam Haley, a former production assistant on the television show "Project Runway."
The new charges included predatory sexual assault, which requires prosecutors to prove that a defendant committed sexual felonies against two people and carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
A judge throws out a charge.
A judge dismissed the forcible oral sex charge against Mr. Weinstein involving Ms. Evans after prosecutors acknowledged that the lead detective in the case failed to inform them about a witness who had cast doubt on Ms. Evans's account.
Three months before the indictment, the detective, Nicholas DiGaudio, had learned from the witness, a friend of Ms. Evans's, that Ms. Evans had once claimed that she willingly performed oral sex on Mr. Weinstein in exchange for the promise of an acting job.
Detective DiGaudio never told prosecutors about this contradictory account, raising questions about the viability of the broader indictment.
Mr. Weinstein changed lawyers, delaying his trial.
Mr. Brafman, Mr. Weinstein's lawyer, withdrew from the case, delaying the trial schedule.
Mr. Brafman said he had uncovered several emails between Mr. Weinstein and his accusers, which suggested that aspects of their relationships were consensual.
Mr. Weinstein settled on a legal team.
Mr. Weinstein's third set of lawyers, who represented him at trial, held a news conference outside State Supreme Court in Manhattan to announce their role. They had taken the case after Mr. Weinstein had hired and fired a second legal team.
The lead lawyer, Donna Rotunno of Chicago, said at the event that Mr. Weinstein had been "railroaded" by the #MeToo movement.
Ms. Sciorra was added to the case.
Moving to shore up their case, prosecutors obtained a new indictment against Mr. Weinstein, allowing them to call Ms. Sciorra, the actress from "The Sopranos," as a witness at the trial.
By her own account, Ms. Sciorra's alleged encounter with the producer happened nearly 30 years before -- too long ago to be charged as a separate count of rape under New York State law. But the indictment permitted her to testify under the theory that her statements would support the charges of predatory sexual assault.
Weinstein was indicted in Los Angeles.
In a surprising move, prosecutors in Los Angeles charged Mr. Weinstein with raping one woman and groping and masturbating in front of a second within two days in February 2013.
The California charges were filed even as the parties in New York gathered on the first day of Mr. Weinstein's trial in Manhattan to discuss jury selection and other legal issues.
Ms. Sciorra testified.
Ms. Sciorra told a hushed courtroom that Mr. Weinstein had pushed his way into her apartment in the early 1990s, after giving her a ride home from a dinner party, and forced her onto a bed.
"I was trying to get him off me," Ms. Sciorra told the jury, her voice cracking with emotion. "I was punching him, kicking him." But Mr. Weinstein held her down, she said, adding: "He got on top of me and he raped me."
Ms. Haley, a former "Project Runway" assistant, took the stand.
Miriam Haley testified that Mr. Weinstein had held her down on a bed and forced oral sex on her in his TriBeCa apartment in July 2006, despite her protests.
"I'm being raped," Ms. Haley recalled thinking.
She added, "I was in so much shock at the time that I just checked out." Ms. Haley said she had sex with Mr. Weinstein two weeks after the first encounter at a hotel and "didn't physically resist."
On cross-examination, she acknowledged that, after the assault, she had continued to accept gifts from him and to correspond with him, sending him friendly emails.
Ms. Mann, once an aspiring actress, testified.
Ms. Mann took the witness stand, accusing Mr. Weinstein of raping her in a Midtown Manhattan hotel room after he blocked her from leaving it.
He ordered her to undress, and injected his genitals with a medication, she said, adding, "I gave up at that point."
On cross-examination, Ms. Mann acknowledged that she had consensual sex with Mr. Weinstein before and after the alleged assault, the last encounter being in 2016.
She broke down in tears when it was revealed in court that she had been sexually abused when she was younger. The moment came as she read a letter she had written to a boyfriend, in which she described Mr. Weinstein as "a pseudo father" who had given her "all the validation I ever needed."
The jury began deliberations.
The five men and seven women on the jury began deliberations after a monthlong trial that included testimony from six accusers in all, as well as from experts and other witnesses.
The jurors grappled with difficult questions. They had to decide if the relationships between the women and Mr. Weinstein were consensual and transactional, as his lawyers suggested. They also had to determine if consensual sex between Mr. Weinstein and some of the women undermined the claims that on other occasions, he assaulted them.

Texto completo: The announcement comes as infections surge in Iran, Italy and South Korea. But the number of cases in China has begun to decline -- for now.
BEIJING -- As new cases of the coronavirus spiked on two continents, the World Health Organization warned on Monday that the world was not ready for a major outbreak, even as it praised China's aggressive efforts to wrest the epidemic under control.
After two weeks on the ground in China, a team sent by the W.H.O. concluded that the draconian measures China imposed a month ago may have saved hundreds of thousands of people from infection. Such measures -- sealing off cities, shutting down businesses and schools, ordering people to remain indoors -- have provoked anger in China and could be difficult to replicate in democratic countries with a greater emphasis on protecting civil liberties.
"There's no question that China's bold approach to the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of what was a rapidly escalating and continues to be a deadly epidemic," said Bruce Aylward, a Canadian doctor and epidemiologist who has overseen international campaigns to fight Ebola and polio and who led the W.H.O. delegation.
The epidemic has already killed more than 2,600 people in China, mostly in Hubei Province, where the outbreak began in December, and infected more than 77,000 people. But the number of new infections in China has been steadily dropping, giving officials in the country confidence that the extraordinary measures have been effective in blunting the virus's spread.
There are concerns, however, that as people begin returning to work in China, the virus could flare up again.
At the same time, new cases are escalating outside China. In Italy, where there has been an eruption of more than 150 cases, the authorities have locked down at least 10 towns, closed schools in major cities and canceled sporting events -- all moves that are echoes of China's tactics, if not quite as draconian.
In Iran, the outbreak has killed at least 12 people as of Monday, the largest number of coronavirus-linked deaths outside China.
South Korea on Monday reported 231 additional cases, bringing the nation's total to 833 cases and seven deaths. By Tuesday, another 60 infections had been recorded, bringing the total to just under 900.
Dr. Aylward said responding swiftly and aggressively to contain outbreaks and treat those infected was paramount.
"We have all got to look at our systems because none of them work fast enough," Dr. Aylward said.
The virus that has crippled China for more than a month now threatens to become a pandemic that could touch virtually every part of the globe. Stock markets in Asia, Europe and North America plunged on Monday as investors worried that the economic disruption the outbreak has already caused in China is all but certain to have wider impact.
The S & P 500 dropped nearly 3 percent in early trading on Monday, after European markets recorded their worst day since 2016, and major benchmarks in Asia closed sharply lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 900 points in the first hours of trading.
China, which was the source of the outbreak, might also offer solutions, according to Chinese officials and the W.H.O.'s assessment, despite the confusion and obfuscation that slowed the government's initial efforts to respond to what was then a mysterious new illness appearing in hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter, in December.
Since late January, the Chinese government has put at least 760 million people -- more than half of its population -- under residential lockdowns of varying strictness, from checkpoints at building entrances to hard limits on going outdoors, according to a New York Times analysis of government announcements in provinces and major cities.
While China's reporting has been at times confused -- with changes to its method of counting causing huge swings in daily tolls -- the overall trend since the middle of this month has indicated a slowing in the rate of infections.
On Sunday, 24 Chinese provinces reported no new cases. Six of them lowered their emergency response measures. In Hubei Province there were 398 new cases, the second consecutive day in which the number of new cases declined.
"The decline we are seeing is real," Dr. Aylward said.
Even so, the death toll continues to rise, with 150 deaths reported on Sunday, the highest in nearly three weeks. In total, 2,663 people in China have been killed by the virus, according to official figures released Tuesday morning.
Liang Wannian, a senior official with China's National Health Commission, said China was not ready to declare victory yet.
"The situation is still very grim," he said at a news conference. "We haven't stopped the epidemic in Wuhan yet."
Many health experts agree it is premature to celebrate given the highly contagious nature of the virus and the potential for a new surge in cases when millions of people go back to work in China or when travel restrictions are lifted.
But they generally agreed with the W.H.O.'s assessment on China's measures.
"The containment definitely worked in China," said Leo Poon, the head of the public health laboratory sciences division at the University of Hong Kong. "The question now is whether similar policies can be applied in other countries."
Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said it was difficult to interpret the case numbers from China, particularly from Hubei. That is because the total number of infections jumped when the authorities expanded the methods used to diagnose them twice in two weeks.
"Trying to look at the case numbers is very difficult," Dr. Tam said. "We don't really know what is influencing those case numbers."
Adding to the confusion, Chinese media outlets reported on Monday that Wuhan would begin easing a sweeping lockdown, by allowing some people to leave. But just hours after news of the change emerged, the authorities backtracked, saying the announcement had been made in error.
What is unclear to many public health experts is whether a shortage of testing kits is causing a large number of cases to remain undetected. Hospitals in China remain overstretched and many patients say they have been turned away. Health care workers are still coming down with the virus despite official pledges to protect them. Mr. Liang, the health official, said more than 3,000 health care workers have been infected.
Another problem is that China does not disclose how many people are being tested. If the proportion of people being tested is really declining, it would suggest there is a downturn in the rate of transmission. "But we don't have that yet," Dr. Tam said.
"From my perspective, it's 'watch and wait and see,' " he said. "It looks positive but it's difficult to interpret what those numbers mean at the moment."
In a speech on Sunday, China's leader, Xi Jinping, called the epidemic the country's most serious public health crisis and said it was "the most difficult to prevent and control" since the founding of the People's Republic.
The epidemic has already severely disrupted life and commerce -- as well as the Communist Party's annual legislative conferences that had been scheduled to begin in Beijing in early March. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress announced on Monday that it had postponed the conferences indefinitely.
Mr. Xi said controlling the outbreak in Wuhan and Hubei as well as preventing the epidemic from spreading to Beijing, the capital, were the country's top two strategic goals. He pledged more pro-growth policies to help overcome the epidemic.
David Heymann, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the case numbers from China suggest that there "may be a decrease in transmission."
China was following its playbook from the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2002-2003, said Dr. Heymann, a former chief of communicable diseases at the W.H.O., when it was "able to stop outbreaks outside the epicenter in Guangdong Province by meticulous outbreak containment and control."
The real test could be yet to come. As China moves to restart its economy, the coronavirus could flare up again.
"There is an acute recognition here that just as we -- the Chinese -- forced the tail of this outbreak down, it could come back up again as people start to move again, the shops start to open, the restaurants open, the schools open," Dr. Aylward said. "It's a risk."

Texto completo: The women, other key figures in the #MeToo movement and legal scholars shared their thoughts with The New York Times.
Harvey Weinstein was one of the most powerful tastemakers in Hollywood. Now, after a Manhattan jury convicted him of two felony sex crimes, he faces the prospect of years in prison.
While the New York case was narrowly focused -- the criminal charges centered largely on just two women -- its symbolism was sweeping. More than 90 women have accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct, and the allegations against him set off the global #MeToo movement.
Mr. Weinstein is the first high-profile man to be ousted from a position of power during the movement and then criminally prosecuted. (He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.)
Moments after the jury announced its decision on Monday, The New York Times asked some of Mr. Weinstein's accusers, other stakeholders in the #MeToo movement and legal experts to interpret the verdict's meaning.
Their responses have been edited and condensed.
Dawn Dunning is a former actress who served as one of several supporting witnesses at Mr. Weinstein's trial, testifying about what prosecutors said was a pattern of predation by the producer.
It was very nerve-racking to testify. I knew I'd have to see him and talk about what happened to me.
I did it for all of us. I did it for the women who couldn't testify. I couldn't not do it.
My biggest fear was him being found not guilty. I'm very relieved. But he wasn't found guilty on all of the counts, so I feel like it was a victory, but not a complete victory. This verdict made it real for people watching from afar that you will be held accountable for your actions. You can't take advantage of people just because you have power and money.
Either way, regardless of the verdict, it didn't change how hard it was to be face to face with him in the courtroom, and testifying in a room full of press. The cross-examination was really difficult.
It was definitely the most stressful thing I've done in my life.
Tarana Burke is the activist who started the original #MeToo movement more than a decade ago.
Most of us will never see the inside of the courtroom, but these women got to take the stand, look him in the eye and say, 'You did this to me.'
He will forever be guilty. That's a thing we have.
Ashley Judd was the first actress to publicly accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct.
The story of #MeToo, of what the movement is about, is that men no longer have tacit permission to use their power or prestige to sexually access girls' and women's bodies. Their power and position cannot be used in secret or in the open to exploit asymmetry of power. There will be consequences in the courtroom, in employment and in society.
This is the way it's supposed to be. This is the way it's supposed to be.
And I think that Harvey's guilty verdict demonstrates how overwhelmingly guilty he was. A perpetrator has to be overwhelmingly guilty for justice to be served at this time.
I would love for Harvey to have a restorative justice process in which he could come emotionally to terms with his wrongs. The criminal justice system is a distant second to a more humane kind of process. This is what he has created for himself: prison, lack of remorse, lack of accountability. The man is going to prison for sex crimes.
Aya Gruber is a former defense lawyer and a law professor at the University of Colorado.
I have mixed reactions about the whole case. On the one hand, I am myself a sexual assault survivor and I believe that the #MeToo movement is good. On the other hand, as a former defense attorney, hinging the future of women's rights on a criminal conviction is a little troubling to me.
The thought that one case could be representative of the entire world of victims and defendants is just wrong. But that's what happened in this case. It became symbolic of not just the entire universe of sexual assault cases, but the entire women's movement.
When we bend rules to favor prosecutors, it's not always the Harvey Weinsteins. When you look at the majority of sex offenders, especially as we're broadening the definition of what counts as a sex offense, a lot of them are juveniles. People who are figuring out their sexuality. A lot of them are people of color and from marginalized neighborhoods. And they're going to be caught up in a system that is extremely harsh, and possibly branded for life.
What is the fallout from a #MeToo movement that insists on incarceration as part of its justice goals?
Harvey Weinstein needed to be held accountable. But sex offenders have a horrible time in jail. It is going to be terrible, state-imposed suffering and torture. I have a hard time feeling happy about that. If accountability can only come through decades in horrific conditions in jail, I don't love that. Not for anyone.
Irwin Reiter worked as Mr. Weinstein's corporate accountant for 30 years. He provided information to The Times that allowed the paper to break the story of Mr. Weinstein's alleged misbehavior in 2017.
The quotes were always the same coming out of his mouth. Everyone who worked for him heard it a thousand times: "I'm superman and you're not. I'm a genius and you're all clerks." The guy thought he could do whatever he wanted.
When they said it was seven men on the jury, I said: good. Because most men are just as appalled by his behavior. It's time for men who witness bad behavior to have the courage to step up and bear witness to it. Never ever forget that these abused women can be your daughter.
Fatima Goss Graves is the president of the National Women's Law Center.
What defense attorneys do is create a narrative that only one type of person could experience sexual violence, and that there is only one type of response. They discount behaviors that are actually really typical in an effort to blame victims. This moment we are in is an opportunity to disrupt the story of a typical survivor, and to disrupt the story of a typical response.
When I think about the last two years, we've seen important examples of individual accountability. I have great hope that individuals in this case have a measure of justice around them. But the last two years have been bigger than one individual. They've been about systems changing, creating new norms and laws that will propel us further in the future. I'm hopeful about the future.
Erika Rosenbaum is a Canadian actress who has accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct. She told The Times her story in 2017.
It cost a lot of women something very personal to change this.
I'm really grateful. I'm really grateful to the women who took the stand, who dared to put themselves out there and endure that examination.
He was found guilty and will be labeled a sexual predator, rightfully so. That's going to follow him for the rest of his life.
The white and wealthy and powerful actually paid a price today.
Chanel Miller wrote a memoir, "Know My Name," about her experience as the victim in a high-profile sexual assault case.
Let it not be lost that every victim who walked through the courtroom doors has just added another layer to their trauma. Justice has come at the cost of their pain. May they unlearn any distorted ideas or character assaults that were fed to them during the trial. What happened was real. It was always wrong. I wish for their rest and well being.
Today we locked one man in one cell. We made progress because survivors keep speaking. Still, this was a case where many others looked away for decades. It was not just power that made him untouchable, people did. We cannot be afforded the neatness of closure. We should confront the question on our collective conscience: The next time you are aware of violence, will you be silent or speak?
Isabelle Kirshner is a former Manhattan prosecutor turned criminal defense lawyer who has represented men accused of sexual assault.
This wasn't "Believe all women," and certainly not "Believe everything women are saying."
Had they believed all women, and what all the women said, he would have been convicted on all charges. It looks like they were fairly careful on what they decided.
Jane Manning is a former Queens prosecutor who is director of the Women's Equal Justice Project.
It's a historic day. A predator who was once untouchable has finally been held accountable. All of the women who spoke out about Harvey Weinstein are heroes: the ones who received a guilty verdict, and the many who didn't.
Annabella Sciorra's case stretches farther back in time than the others; perhaps that was a challenge for the jury. But there's no doubt in my mind that her testimony mattered. It helped establish a pattern; it supported the accounts of Miriam Haleyi and Jessica Mann. She deserves admiration and gratitude for her courage; all the prosecution witnesses do.
The conviction of Harvey Weinstein is a stunning victory for every single woman who refused to remain silent any longer.
Rowena Chiu is a former assistant at Miramax, the production company founded by Harvey Weinstein and his brother, Bob. She accused Mr. Weinstein of assaulting her on the job in 1998.
I had said in an interview a few days ago, that this isn't just a story of one man. Even in the light of a conviction, it isn't just one person. Obviously it is a really important victory for the #MeToo movement. But the #MeToo movement is much, much bigger than what happens to Harvey. This is certainly a moment of great encouragement and a milestone for me personally and the movement as a whole.
In some ways, I feel that the life I've built today, every day that I live and enjoy my life is a victory over Harvey. That is much more meaningful than going for a legal victory. Because we all know the legal system is flawed.
Many of us are doing incredible work that stems from surviving trauma. I think that is very much something I want to put out there. Many of us are doing these incredible things. The very fact that I'm with my kids in a sand pit, is a victory over Harvey, whether he ends up in jail or not.
Debra Katz, a civil rights and employment lawyer, has represented several people who have spoken out about Mr. Weinstein.
There was a great deal of tension in the courtroom this morning, waiting for the jury. When we got to the first count of guilty, there was a feeling of extraordinary relief.
I felt some measure of justice had been done. He is now a convicted rapist. It was an extraordinary moment of social reckoning. It's no longer OK to say that this was transactional, that these women knew exactly what they were getting. It's no longer acceptable to blame women for the fact that they were targeted by a sexual predator. This was a true repudiation of the arguments that Donna Rotunno, his lawyer, made, that these women used Weinstein and that he was an unwitting victim.
When Rotunno exited the courthouse today, her response was extremely telling. She said Harvey Weinstein was completely shocked. For a man who has taken this kind of advantage and abused women for decades and taken this as his prerogative, I would say he is shocked.
Lucia Evans's accusation of sexual assault against Mr. Weinstein was originally included, and then dropped, from the New York case.
I am so impressed by the women who participated in the criminal case up through the verdict. Witnessing firsthand many of the obstacles that stood in their way only deepens my appreciation of their courage. I truly wish I was given the opportunity to stand next to them, to see my case through to the end.
Hopefully this gives more women the strength to come forward.
It really took a village of women to do this.
Roger Canaff is a lawyer and former New York City sex crimes prosecutor.
It's a tremendous victory for the Manhattan D.A.'s office -- one of the most impressive and surprising convictions I've seen in 25 years of doing this work.
I think that more offices will be encouraged to bring more difficult cases because of this verdict.
I really do think this verdict is going to be looked at as a very important milestone in how powerful men are going to be held accountable.
I think this is indicative of a change in how we are going to view acceptable male behavior, how we may be able to hold offenders like Weinstein, powerful men, and powerful women, how we can hold those offenders accountable, not only in the court of public opinion, but courts of law as well.
Zelda Perkins is a former Miramax assistant who was the first woman to break a nondisclosure agreement with Mr. Weinstein.
Harvey going down for five years, 10 years, is not the end of this. This does not solve the problem. We can't all just turn our eyes back to normal life and think everything is OK.
The fight absolutely doesn't stop here. I think Harvey has become the ogre and the figurehead of this awful situation, but he is not the only one. And I think we have to remember that #MeToo was not about Harvey Weinstein. Tarana Burke did not start #MeToo because of Weinstein.
#MeToo has not been finished by him going to jail. And I hope this is the beginning of judges and juries understanding and taking the nuances of abuses of power more seriously.

Texto completo: Readers assess Bernie Sanders's chances against Donald Trump and offer advice to the Democratic candidates.
To the Editor:
Re "In Show of Might, Sanders Wins Nevada" (front page, Feb. 23):
As a lifelong Democrat, I will be voting for Bernie Sanders if it turns out that he wins the nomination. I would vote for any Democratic candidate in November once I am in the voting booth. Donald Trump must not be allowed another four years in office. That much is very clear.
I agree with Charles M. Blow ("Don't Doubt That Bernie Can Win," column, Feb. 24) that Senator Sanders stands a good chance of defeating Donald Trump despite the democratic socialist imprint. I believe that Senator Sanders will get the black and Hispanic vote as well as the moderate and the independent vote.
The same people who held their noses and voted for Donald Trump in 2016 because they came to mistrust (or despise) Hillary Clinton will do the same thing in November, but this time it is Mr. Trump who is despised and mistrusted. November cannot come fast enough.
Len DiSesa
Doylestown, Pa.
To the Editor:
Whether one agrees with Bernie Sanders's political and social policies -- and I happen to be one who does -- I won't vote for him in the primary because this country is not in the mood for a democratic socialist mode of living.
So if it is Senator Sanders versus Donald Trump in the general election, there is a pretty good chance that Mr. Trump will win. The Russians want four more years of Mr. Trump and will try to rig this election so that it is a Trump-Sanders contest.
Allen Cohen
Santa Barbara, Calif.
To the Editor:
Many thanks to Paul Krugman (column, nytimes.com, Feb. 23), David Leonhardt (column, Feb. 24) and Charles M. Blow for offering advice to Bernie Sanders about enlarging his tent as his campaign rolls on. What a welcome contrast to the articles that assume that most of us agree that Senator Sanders should be stopped somehow.
No matter whom we nominate, that nominee will face a host of smears, disinformation and possibly even criminal mischief from the White House and the G.O.P. The best antidote is to keep up a steady mantra asking what the Trump administration and the Senate as led by Mitch McConnell are doing to keep the Russians and other hackers and bot-makers out of our election.
Anne Mackin
Boston
To the Editor:
I will support and vote for the candidate who says, in his or her opening statement in a debate, something like:
"I will answer questions only about the things I believe in, and the policies I would, if elected, try to carry out regarding such things as the economy, foreign policy, education, immigration, infrastructure, health plans, global warming and gun control.
"I do not intend to waste any time talking about my opponents. If you want to know what they think, ask them. If they choose to attack my agenda, so be it. But if they do so and don't offer viable alternatives, I don't think that they are worthy of your support. First question, please."
Philip Barnett
Scottsdale, Ariz.
To the Editor:
Here is a question I would like to see posed to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren at the next Democratic presidential debate:
"If the Republicans retain their majority in the Senate, your 'Medicare for all' proposals will be dead on arrival, and there is no guarantee that they would pass even if the Democrats control both the House and the Senate.
"If you are not able to get your health plans passed by Congress, what is your Plan B?"
Burton Heatherly
Palatine, Ill.
To the Editor:
In our last presidential campaign, Donald Trump's message was, What have you got to lose? Now we know: dignity, respect, truth, compassion, trust and spine.
Democratic candidates, please aim your arrows away from one another and train them on the obvious target.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders told "60 Minutes" that it would be "unfair" to say "everything is bad" about Cuba's Communist revolution.
MIAMI -- Comments from Senator Bernie Sanders praising aspects of the Communist Cuban revolution drew a forceful rebuke on Monday from Cuban-Americans, Florida Democrats and several of Mr. Sanders's opponents, who cast him as too extreme in his views to represent the party as its presidential nominee.
Mr. Sanders's remarks threatened to undercut his candidacy in the nation's largest presidential battleground state as he seeks to build momentum on a broader scale after a series of early primary victories. In Florida, Mr. Sanders stands to alienate not just Cubans but also a far more diverse group of Latinos, including Colombians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, than the ones he won overwhelmingly in Saturday's Nevada caucuses.
"I'm totally disgusted and insulted," said Lourdes Diaz, the president of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus in Broward County, who is Cuban-American. "Maybe this will open people's eyes to how super, super liberal and radical Bernie is. I'm not going to defend him anymore. I'm over it."
In a "60 Minutes" interview that aired Sunday night on CBS, Mr. Sanders said he opposed "the authoritarian nature" of the Cuban regime.
"But you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad," Mr. Sanders told the host, Anderson Cooper. "When Fidel Castro came to office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?"
Mr. Cooper noted that many political dissidents remained imprisoned in Cuba.
"That's right," Mr. Sanders acknowledged. "And we condemn that."
"Unlike Donald Trump, let's be clear, I do not think that Kim Jong-un is a good friend," Mr. Sanders added, emphasizing a contrast with President Trump that Democrats have tried to sharpen. "I don't trade love letters with a murdering dictator. Vladimir Putin, not a great friend of mine."
The comments ricocheted across Miami, a bastion of Cuban exiles where any defense of Mr. Castro is considered a disqualification for those seeking public office. Many Cuban-Americans are Republicans, but those who are Democrats have been increasingly worried that Mr. Sanders's views on authoritarian leaders in Latin America could cost the party support among Hispanic voters -- whom Republicans have been courting for the past year.
Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, has cast himself as a democratic socialist in the vein of social democrats in Europe. But though as a candidate he likes to compare his policies to those of Denmark, in the past he has expressed praise not only for Mr. Castro in Cuba but also support for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua -- troubling stances in Florida, a magnet for Latin Americans fleeing political unrest in Managua, Havana and Caracas.
Mr. Sanders doubled down on his comments in a CNN town hall on Monday night, arguing that many people in Cuba were "illiterate" when Mr. Castro came to power.
"I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing," he said, adding that he has been "critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world," including Cuba, Nicaragua, Saudi Arabia, China and Russia.
Sensing an opening to remind voters about Mr. Sanders's more left-wing views, three of his opponents pounced on the Castro clip from "60 Minutes."
"Fidel Castro left a dark legacy of forced labor camps, religious repression, widespread poverty, firing squads, and the murder of thousands of his own people," Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor whose campaign ads have flooded the Florida television airwaves, wrote on Twitter. "But sure, Bernie, let's talk about his literacy program."
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., tweeted: "After four years of looking on in horror as Trump cozied up to dictators, we need a president who will be extremely clear in standing against regimes that violate human rights abroad. We can't risk nominating someone who doesn't recognize this."
Cristóbal Alex, a senior adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., called Mr. Sanders's comments "dangerous" and "deeply offensive to the many people in Florida, New Jersey and across the country that have fled political persecution and sought refuge in the United States."
Mr. Sanders might have little to worry about in the Democratic race: Florida does not hold its primary until March 17, after bigger states such as California and Texas.
But Florida Democrats fear what a Sanders nomination could mean for the general election in November. Local political operatives said they were inundated with phone calls and text messages from elected officials, candidates and activists worried that down-ballot candidates could suffer. Some wondered privately if they should disavow Mr. Sanders now.
Mr. Sanders's campaign said his views have remained the same and argued that President Barack Obama made a similar allusion to Cuba's educational gains in a 2016 speech in Havana.
"Senator Sanders has clearly and consistently criticized Fidel Castro's authoritarianism and condemned his human rights abuses, and he's simply echoing President Obama's acknowledgment that Cuba made progress, especially in education," Mike Casca, the campaign's communications director, said in a statement.
But Mr. Obama, who praised Cuba's "enormous achievements in education and in health care," had made a historic policy overture and was not in the middle of a primary campaign.
As condemnation of Mr. Sanders's remarks grew, Terrie Rizzo, the chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, issued a statement that did not mention him but clearly distanced the party from the presidential front-runner.
"Candidates need to understand our immigrant communities' shared stories, as well as provide solutions to issues that matter to all Floridians including access to affordable health care and rejecting a Trump economy that works only for the very rich," she said.
Representatives Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala, Miami Democrats who flipped their competitive congressional districts in 2018 and face challengers this fall, quickly denounced Mr. Sanders's comments.
"He's way off," Ms. Shalala told reporters in Miami Beach. She urged Mr. Sanders to meet with her constituents and hear about their experiences firsthand.
Hector Caraballo, a former political prisoner in Cuba who founded the Miami-Dade Cuban American Democratic Club, said no one familiar with Mr. Sanders's political career could be surprised by his views.
Miami Democrats expected grainy video clips of Mr. Sanders's most objectionable commentary to resurface during the campaign. What galled Mr. Caraballo and others was that Mr. Sanders made new remarks showing no evolution on his opinions, in spite of decades of hardship in Cuba.
"This just confirmed what I think of him as a leader," Mr. Caraballo said. "We have very little time left to avoid a political disaster."
Evelyn Pérez-Verdía, a Latino issues strategist who is Colombian-American and routinely advises her clients about the nuances among Hispanic voters from different countries, said the danger of Mr. Sanders's views on Cuba was that voters who fled other regimes were also likely to feel insulted.
She said Mr. Sanders and his advisers "don't understand the tentacles of what they're doing."
"He's basically saying to Cuban-Americans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, 'Your pain is not a big deal,"' said Mike Hernández, a Democratic political consultant and Cuban-American. "And that's not a strategy to win the state of Florida."
Mr. Hernández said he would not vote for Mr. Sanders if he were the nominee against Mr. Trump: "I'll write someone in," he said.

A Sign of the Times? The Democratic Primary Has Become a Free-for-All

Texto completo: As the primary race becomes a battle of all against all, and the field suddenly seems to be constricting, the divisiveness and negative attacks are rising.
No one has tagged a rival with a bully-boy nickname like "Sleepy" or "Liddle."
But as push comes to shove in the Democratic primary, candidates and their surrogates have descended to a level of personal animus that was rare before the era of President Trump.
On Monday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. launched a digital ad in South Carolina saying Bernie Sanders "can't be trusted" after weighing a 2012 primary against "our first African-American president," Barack Obama.
After Pete Buttigieg attacked Mr. Sanders's victory in Nevada, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York lectured Mr. Buttigieg on Twitter, saying "not to be so smug when you just got your ass kicked."
And lest last week's Democratic debate recede into history (it was just five days ago), one memorable and searing moment was a highly personal exchange in which Mr. Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dripped contempt for each other, with Ms. Klobuchar saying, "I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete."
As the primary race becomes a battle of all against all, "Hunger Games"-style, and the field suddenly seems to be constricting, the divisiveness and negative attacks are rising. Mr. Sanders's commanding win in Nevada -- he earned 24 pledged delegates as the final results were tallied Monday, with Mr. Biden taking nine and Mr. Buttigieg, three -- has triggered alarm among some center-left Democratic officials and voters. His moderate challengers have sought in vain to push one another to the exits to consolidate the anti-Sanders vote.
Past presidential primaries certainly had their share of negative campaigning. But much of the intraparty warfare used to be waged behind the scenes -- through "oppo dumps" of compromising research against opponents or anonymous criticism in newspaper stories. Today the combination of social media democratization and Mr. Trump's habit of lobbing nasty personal attacks have removed the filters.
"Candidates always tried to stay above it and never get down deeply in the mud," said Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary for former President Bill Clinton. "Trump has changed that. He's modeled the idea that the presidential candidates are the ones to make the sharpest attacks, and there's no bottom."
On Saturday night, after Mr. de Blasio, a surrogate for Mr. Sanders, tweeted at Mr. Buttigieg, saying "Dude, show some humility," Mr. Lockhart immediately replied to the New York mayor, "Who cares what you think?"
Four or five years ago, Mr. Lockhart said in an interview, he would have had to phone a reporter to weigh in, and the mainstream press, acting as gatekeeper, might or might not have quoted him.
Now, "there's the ability for people to have their own platforms," he said. "I tweeted it, and got back to my dinner."
David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, lamented that the last debate, which smashed records as the most watched Democratic presidential debate ever, was so intensely negative. "My worry is that everyone looked so mad at each other," he said. "When every person on the stage has their oppo ready to go and delivers it with such ferocity, you may win that individual skirmish, but you're giving away the bigger picture -- the need for people to be inspired."
Yes, there are many examples of Democratic rivals turning negative in past primary races. Strategists for Hillary Clinton in 2008 dangled Mr. Obama's youthful drug use. In 2016, Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Sanders of smearing her for receiving donations from rich people.
But those digs feel pretty innocent compared to this year, when a burst of gloves-off negativity seems to have been triggered by the prospect of a staunchly leftist nominee in Mr. Sanders, the late entry of Michael R. Bloomberg and a fierce fight over which moderate candidate ought to be Mr. Sanders's leading foil.
On Sunday night, Mr. Sanders praised Fidel Castro for Cuba's literacy program on "60 Minutes." Many responses from fellow Democrats were searing, including two congresswomen from Florida with sizable Cuban electorates. "As the first South American immigrant member of Congress who proudly represents thousands of Cuban Americans, I find Senator Bernie Sanders' comments on Castro's Cuba absolutely unacceptable," Representative Debbi Mucarsel-Powell, one of the Florida congresswomen, said on Twitter.
Fernand Amandi, a pollster and political consultant in South Florida, went further: "Democrats, nominating this man will absolutely re-elect @realDonaldTrump and end our Constitutional republic," he wrote.
With seven Democrats set to appear in another presidential debate on Tuesday in South Carolina, the negativity is unlikely to let up. Mr. Buttigieg previewed that he would continue to try to undermine Mr. Sanders as a high-risk choice. On Monday, he tweeted that after Mr. Sanders's "60 Minutes" interview, it would be disastrous to nominate the self-described democratic socialist "after four years of looking on in horror as Trump cozied up to dictators."
On election night in Nevada, Mr. Buttigieg, who has been the most aggressive in taking on Mr. Sanders, said his rival "believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans."
Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, is also highly likely to be a broad target again. At the debate last week, Elizabeth Warren pushed Mr. Bloomberg hard over derogatory comments he had made about women, and his settlements with former employees that kept some women from discussing such incidents. The blowback led Mr. Bloomberg later to release three women from nondisclosure agreements.
Not everyone is unhappy about a fierce primary fight.
Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia said it was entirely reasonable that candidates were probing one another's vulnerabilities. "Senator Sanders, the current front-runner, has not faced true sustained scrutiny in either of his runs for president," Mr. McAuliffe said. "So it's much better to understand his electability now in the primary than to not know until he's facing Donald Trump's smear machine."
And Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist, was glad for the new tenor of the primary. It reveals who has the steel for the coming showdown of the general election, he said.
"It's one thing to tell people about your agenda, it's another to show people how hard you'll fight for it, but that's what candidates are starting to do, and it's about time," said Mr. Ferguson, who worked for Mrs. Clinton in 2016.
"Democrats want a nominee who will be the general to lead us into battle against Donald Trump," he continued. "They're not going to promote someone to that role unless they've proven they can win a few skirmishes first."

Malaysia's Prime Minister Resigns, at Least in Name

Texto completo: The move appears to be an attempt to suddenly remake a government -- possibly with Mr. Mahathir, 94, still at the helm.
They were the oddest of political colleagues: a nonagenarian onetime autocrat and the former protégé he had jailed for sodomy.
Mahathir Mohamad, the 94-year-old prime minister of Malaysia, and his perennial presumptive heir, Anwar Ibrahim, joined forces in 2018 to oust a governing party to which both had once belonged. That party, the United Malays National Organization, known as UMNO, was at the center of the 1MDB scandal, the brazen looting of billions of dollars of Malaysia's public funds.
But the unwieldy coalition that brought Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Anwar together crumbled on Monday.
After a flurry of meetings that had political analysts feverishly analyzing whose car was pulling up in which driveway, Mr. Mahathir submitted his letter of resignation as prime minister on Monday afternoon.
The move, however, did not appear to be designed to result in Mr. Mahathir actually giving up leadership of Malaysia, a job that he has held twice, analysts said.
Malaysia's constitutional monarch accepted the resignation letter on Monday evening but then named Mr. Mahathir the interim prime minister, according to Mohd Zuki Ali, the nation's chief secretary.
Vying political blocs in the country had earlier expressed support for Mr. Mahathir's continuing as prime minister.
"The wonderful thing for Mahathir is that it is impossible for him to lose because heads he wins, tails he wins," said James Chin, director of the Asia Institute Tasmania at the University of Tasmania.
It was a sleight of hand characteristic of Asia's shrewdest veteran politician -- and it left Malaysians breathless from the political machinations.
But with the governing coalition in tatters and rival political blocs furiously forming new alignments, the only constant in Malaysia on Monday was a sense of uncertainty. Could Mr. Mahathir have overplayed his hand?
Reflecting the jittery atmosphere, the Malaysian securities market took a hit, and Malaysia's national bank issued a statement on Monday, saying it was "closely monitoring conditions in the financial markets."
Mr. Mahathir's unexpected resignation also raises questions about the future of political and economic overhauls in a country where Malay nationalist politics were promoted during Mr. Mahathir's first term in office, from 1981 to 2003, and look to be gaining ground again.
"Malaysia will lose," Mr. Chin said. "This means that it's back to the same Malay supremacy politics that got the country into trouble in the first place."
The diverse coalition that came to power in 2018, after voters rejected Prime Minister Najib Razak and his long-powerful UMNO party, placed a group of ethnically Chinese and other minority politicians in positions of prominence for the first time.
Malaysia is still struggling with the fallout of billions of dollars that were pillaged from a national investment fund, 1MDB, or 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Mr. Najib is accused of having orchestrated the looting.
Trials related to the 1MDB scandal are continuing and have drawn in forces as diverse as Goldman Sachs and Hollywood movie stars to Chinese officials and luxury handbag makers.
Now 72, Mr. Anwar was once a fiery leader of a Malay nationalist youth movement and served as deputy prime minister during Mr. Mahathir's first, 22-year tenure as prime minister. But Mr. Mahathir purged his deputy, and Mr. Anwar spent years in and out of jail on sodomy convictions.
The sex act is illegal in Malaysia, but rights groups said Mr. Anwar's jailing was politically motivated.
Mr. Mahathir eventually settled on Mr. Najib as a protégé. Mr. Najib served nine years as prime minister, until the 2018 elections that returned Mr. Mahathir to power, leading a coalition that included liberal Chinese politicians and Islamists.
On Monday morning, Mr. Anwar met with Mr. Mahathir, and hinted that all was well.
"I was touched by his attitude and principle," Mr. Anwar said, recounting that Mr. Mahathir had reaffirmed that he "would not bow to the groups that want to grab power without setting any reform agenda."
Then a couple hours later, Mr. Mahathir submitted his resignation letter.
The afternoon brought more twists and turns. Mr. Mahathir's party, the Malaysian United Indigenous Party, quit the governing coalition. Then Mr. Mahathir announced that he had quit his own party, adding to the political intrigue. He is expected to meet with Malaysia's king in the late afternoon.
Lim Guan Eng, Malaysia's finance minister and the leader of a Chinese-majority party that pledged on Monday to continue backing Mr. Mahathir, released a statement saying that the prime minister had resigned not because he wanted to outmaneuver Mr. Anwar but because he was disgusted with members of his coalition who had plotted to join with UMNO.
In neighboring Singapore, Goh Chok Tong, the former prime minister of Singapore, took to Twitter to express his astonishment with the political tumult in Malaysia.
"It is a privilege for a septuagenarian to be able to enjoy nature and the simple pleasures of life, unlike nonagenarian Mahathir," Mr. Goh wrote.

Texto completo: U.S. officials said they were looking at ways to retaliate for China's expulsion of three Wall Street Journal reporters, including evicting Chinese journalists who file intelligence reports.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is considering punishing Chinese journalists and state-run news organizations -- as well as Chinese intelligence agencies -- because of China's decision to expel three Wall Street Journal reporters, American officials said on Monday.
Those actions could be partly aimed at limiting Chinese intelligence collection efforts in the United States by expelling journalists who have contact with intelligence agencies, people familiar with the discussions said.
"The United States condemns Beijing's expulsion of three Wall Street Journal foreign correspondents," said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council. "This expulsion is yet another attempt to control the press, and prevent the world's readers as well as investors from reading important stories about China."
"The United States is considering a range of responses to this egregious act," he added.
Retaliation by the United States could lead to escalating cycles of retribution involving the two governments, private and state-run news organizations and intelligence agencies.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday that it was expelling the reporters in retaliation for a headline on a Feb. 3 Wall Street Journal opinion column: "China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia." The column criticized China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
Historians say a Chinese reformer, Liang Qichao, coined the phrase "the sick man of Asia" in Chinese in the late 19th century to describe the Qing dynasty, but Chinese officials argued after the column's publication that it was an insult to the Chinese people and demanded that The Journal apologize.
A day before China's announcement, the United States designated five Chinese state-run news organizations as official foreign government functionaries, subject to similar rules as diplomats stationed in the United States.
None of the reporters targeted by Beijing had anything to do with the column or its headline. Like most American newspapers, The Journal maintains a wall between its news-gathering operations and its editorial pages.
The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said on Wednesday that the government's decision was "an extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organizations by taking retribution against their China-based correspondents."
The organization also said it was aware of nine foreign journalists who had been expelled or forced to leave China because of a nonrenewal of visas since 2013.
Mr. Ullyot noted that number in his statement on Monday. American officials were scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon in the White House to discuss recommendations on whether to expel Chinese journalists. Bloomberg News first reported on the scheduling of the meeting.
Among the administration's concerns is a belief that, unlike American journalists, some of the Chinese journalists working for state-run news organizations in the United States are filing reports, at least part of the time, for Chinese intelligence agencies, according to people familiar with the matter.
They said many of the Chinese journalists suspected of having those ties occupied a hybrid role, with some accredited journalists possibly serving as full-time intelligence operatives.
While the journalists may regularly file news stories, they are believed to also be sending information and analysis back to Chinese intelligence agencies. If the journalists obtain exclusive information, they could be required by officials to provide the information to the agencies rather than write an article, one of the people familiar with the matter said.
In recent years, American officials have expressed growing concern over what they call Chinese influence and propaganda efforts in the United States. They have also increasingly scrutinized a variety of Chinese citizens -- diplomats, journalists and scientists among them -- for intelligence collection operations. In September, the United States secretly expelled two employees of the Chinese Embassy in Washington after the men and their wives drove onto a sensitive military base in Virginia. It appeared to be the first expulsion of Chinese diplomats in more than 30 years.
There are hundreds more visas given to Chinese journalists in the United States than there are accredited American journalists in China, U.S. officials said. As of Monday morning, the Trump administration was not considering an expulsion on that scale, officials said. An immediate wave of expulsions might include fewer than a dozen Chinese journalists, one official said.
Some U.S. officials have argued that expelling journalists runs counter to the American principle of freedom of the press.
Tensions between the United States and China have been high, largely because of President Trump's trade war. The two countries reached an initial trade deal in December, but American national security officials have continued to push other nations to reject Chinese technology and infrastructure projects, arguing that they pose security risks.
President Xi Jinping of China has tightened limits on civil society and free expression since taking power in 2012. That includes greater clampdowns on foreign news organizations. Foreign journalists living in China usually get visas that allow them to have one-year residence permits, but in some cases that has been curtailed to a matter of months -- to try to coerce the journalists not to report on issues such as the mass internment of Muslims in the Xinjiang region.
Matthew Pottinger, the chief deputy on the National Security Council, is a former reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Beijing bureau. He has worked for three years on the council, most of the time as senior Asia director, and has been a proponent of aggressive policies toward China.
Two of the Journal reporters, Josh Chin, an American and the deputy bureau chief in Beijing, and Philip Wen, an Australian, flew out of Beijing on Monday. The third reporter, Chao Deng, an American, is in the coronavirus containment zone of Wuhan, where she had been reporting. She is unable to leave because of quarantine measures.
The expulsions have led to an extraordinary reaction within The Journal. On Thursday, 53 reporters and editors at the newspaper, mostly in mainland China and Hong Kong, sent a letter to William Lewis, the chief executive of Dow Jones and the newspaper's publisher, and Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corp, the Rupert Murdoch-controlled parent company of Dow Jones, criticizing the way that top editors handled the fallout over the Feb. 3 headline. It said the leaders should offer a formal apology.
Over the weekend, Mr. Lewis told the letter writers that he empathized with them but would not overrule editorial decision-making. He also pledged to continue pushing to get the expelled journalists' credentials restored.
"I fully understand that the headline we published offended you, some of those closest to you, and many others," he wrote in an email obtained by The New York Times. "I am sure that you understand why it is inappropriate for the company, or anyone else, to intervene in editorial matters."
He added, "I take seriously the hurt many feel, but this is a complex situation, and the company is caught in a political crossfire."

Texto completo: A group led by Ginni Thomas has targeted officials in the administration, and lobbied for its own preferred choices. As the president's distrust in those serving him has grown, so has its sway.
For the past 18 months, Ginni Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, and other conservatives have plied the White House with memos and suggestions about which people to fire -- and who should replace them.
President Trump has generally treated Ms. Thomas's suggestions coolly, passing them off to advisers, according to people familiar with Ms. Thomas's efforts. But since the end of the Senate impeachment trial, the president has become more distrustful of the people filling the ranks of government and has been giving those recommendations a closer look.
The memos from Ms. Thomas were first reported by Axios.
Among Ms. Thomas's top targets have been officials at the National Security Council, the former head of the White House personnel office, Sean Doocey, and other top White House aides. Another target was Jessie K. Liu, who recently left her job as the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia for a job in the Treasury Department that was later withdrawn by the White House.
Ms. Thomas, a politically active conservative who for nearly seven years has led a group called Groundswell, also successfully lobbied for a role for Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the former attorney general of Virginia who is now the acting deputy secretary of homeland security.
Another conservative, Becky Norton Dunlop, an official at the Heritage Foundation, has also repeatedly passed names of possible appointments to personnel officials, administration officials said.
Mr. Trump recently shook up the personnel office, replacing Mr. Doocey with John McEntee, who was fired from his previous job at the White House, with a mandate to look for "bad" people, according to multiple administration officials.
Some administration aides have long been suspicious that people like Ms. Thomas and Ms. Dunlop are less interested in pro-Trump purity than in appointments for their own networks of friends. White House officials have privately questioned Ms. Thomas's lobbying on personnel, and have said Mr. Trump -- who is facing several decisions before the Supreme Court personally and in terms of administration policy -- has made clear he is conscious of whom she is married to.
Still, in the last year, as Mr. Trump has grown more mistrustful of his government, the sway held by Ms. Thomas and her group has increased. Administration officials have routinely sent aides to attend weekly Groundswell meetings held at the offices of Judicial Watch, another conservative group led by a vocal defender of the president, Tom Fitton.
Mr. Trump was also given a memo about Ms. Liu that officials attributed to a Senate Judiciary Committee staff member named Barbara Ledeen, another member of Groundswell, though it was drafted with input from other conservatives. The memo mentioned the failure to prosecute Andrew G. McCabe, a former F.B.I. official whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked, as a strike against Ms. Liu, as well as her signing the sentencing memo of Michael T. Flynn, a friend of Ms. Ledeen's.
Ms. Ledeen and Ms. Thomas did not respond to requests for comment.
Ms. Ledeen also raised concerns with the staff of Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, about Ms. Liu when she was nominated for the No. 3 job at the Justice Department in March 2019, according to three people familiar with the discussion. After Mr. Lee and others objected to Ms. Liu's appointment, the White House withdrew her nomination.
Ms. Liu became a flash point again when she was nominated to the Treasury Department post. Someone provided Mr. Trump with a fresh copy of the memo attributed to Ms. Ledeen, according to a person familiar with the events.
And another memo Ms. Thomas passed along accused Mr. Doocey of obstruction related to State Department jobs, and claimed that he had surreptitiously switched one appointee for another for a foreign aid agency. That particular claim was demonstrably false, according to three people familiar with the memo.
The New York Times reported in January 2019 that Mr. Trump met that month with Ms. Thomas and a half-dozen of her members at what was at times a contentious meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. At that meeting, Ms. Thomas insisted that White House personnel were blocking appointments of supporters of the president, and handed him a list of suggested appointees.
Since the meeting, Ms. Thomas and her group have been pressing Mr. Trump to replace job holders they did not consider reliably conservative and have complained to White House staff that they were not getting enough attention from the personnel office.
Privately, officials in that office told associates that Ms. Thomas's suggested hires could never survive proper vetting, including possibilities such as David A. Clarke, the former sheriff of Milwaukee County for a homeland security role, or the Fox News guest Dan Bongino for a counterterrorism post.
Despite her own history of supporting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for the Republican presidential nomination and of trying to stop Mr. Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Ms. Thomas has presented herself to the White House as a barometer of who is sufficiently conservative and supportive of the Trump agenda, according to current and former administration officials.
Mr. Trump has alternately listened to and been dismissive of Ms. Thomas's entreaties, according to people familiar with his thinking. But the White House has frequently sent administration officials to meet with members of Groundswell.
A person close to Ms. Thomas said she did not intend for Groundswell to be her alter ego, and that she merely saw herself as a launching point for conservative input at the White House.
One concern among White House officials has been that outsiders like Ms. Thomas and her allies do not understand how the personnel office functions.
In its previous iteration under Mr. Doocey, the office tried to serve as a buffer, getting input and at times pushback about possible hires from the White House Counsel's Office, the Office of Political Affairs and cabinet secretaries. Mr. Doocey, who had told associates that his goal was to always try to shield the president from problematic appointments, reported directly to the chief of staff.
Mr. Trump would sometimes tell conservative activists such as Ms. Thomas that he could not fulfill their wishes because his aides were stopping him. He has said such things even when he agreed that certain recommendations did not make sense, essentially faulting aides for his own choices to avoid confrontation, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Mr. McEntee will report directly to Mr. Trump, giving Mr. McEntee more leeway but also denying the president that buffer when it comes to dealing with people who try to lobby him on personnel matters.
But it is unclear how much ideological purity Mr. Trump can achieve in his appointments, given how few Republicans supported his candidacy from its inception, the rivalries within his administration, and the stream of aides, consultants, advisers or friends who at some point have whispered in his ear that someone was trying to undermine him.

Texto completo: The editor in chief was fired -- and rehired -- before this week's formal rollout of a tech-investigations site backed by millions from the founder of Craigslist.
After a turbulent year during which the top editor was fired and rehired, The Markup, a website with ambitions to combine investigative and data-driven journalism to cover technology, will make its formal debut Tuesday.
"We're calling it a launch," said Julia Angwin, the editor in chief. "But we're also cognizant of the fact that we've had several big public announcements prior to this, so this is a 'show our work' moment for us."
"Show our work" is also a motto of The Markup. Alongside its articles, it will provide readers with detailed explanations of how its reporters got their stories.
The Markup was founded in 2018 by Ms. Angwin, an investigative journalist and a veteran of The Wall Street Journal and ProPublica; Jeff Larson, a data journalist who also worked at ProPublica; and Sue Gardner, a former head of the Wikimedia Foundation.
It was bolstered by a gift of more than $ 20 million from Craig Newmark, the Craigslist founder, whose other philanthropic beneficiaries include the City University of New York's journalism graduate school (now named for him), ProPublica, the Poynter Institute and Consumer Reports.
The Markup's topsy-turvy development period drew widespread attention among journalists and tech-industry people.
Last April, a few months before a planned July start date, Ms. Angwin was fired by email, and most of the small newsroom staff resigned in protest. Mr. Larson was installed as editor in chief.
Ms. Angwin said in a letter at the time to Mr. Newmark that Ms. Gardner, then the site's executive director, wanted to change The Markup's mission to "one based on advocacy against the tech companies," instead of "producing meaningful data-centered journalism about the impact of technology on society." Ms. Gardner disputed that characterization in an interview with The New York Times.
By August, Ms. Angwin was back as editor in chief, and Mr. Larson and Ms. Gardner were no longer at the site. Joining Ms. Angwin on the revamped leadership team were Evelyn Larrubia, previously of the public radio program "Marketplace," as managing editor, and Nabiha Syed, formerly BuzzFeed's associate general counsel, as president. The staff now includes around 17 reporters, editors and engineers, Ms. Angwin said.
The Markup's first two investigations concern algorithms, the equations that give tech companies influence over their customers' lives. The first, going online Tuesday, is a collaboration with Consumer Reports. The second, in partnership with The Guardian, is set to publish later this week.
"There needs to be a watchdog for algorithms," Ms. Angwin said. "The government is not currently equipped with the technical expertise, time or money to do this, nor are there regulations requiring it."
The Markup also has a collaboration in the works with The Times.
"There's no money changing hands with those partnerships," Ms. Syed said. "It's in order to build credibility and audience."
To promote the debut, The Markup is running ads in the New York City subway and commissioned a mural in the Mission neighborhood of San Francisco.
"I don't want to just publish this for people who are on Twitter who care already about tech coverage," Ms. Syed said. "I want a broader conversation about what tech means in your life. To me the best way to do that is to enter physical space."
Once it is up and running, the site will not be a must-visit for readers interested in the latest gadgets.
"Nobody needs another tech news site," Ms. Angwin said. "We do need another tech investigative site. Tech is the way power manifests itself these days."

Texto completo: They were the kind of witnesses who were once avoided by prosecutors, torn to shreds by defense attorneys and regarded with skepticism by jurors.
Some of the women who accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault had been friendly with him, and some remained cordial or even intimate with him after their assaults. They waited years before reporting the crimes, and then could offer no forensic evidence of violence. Specific details of the memories they recounted were sometimes fuzzy and inconsistent.
But on Monday, their testimony against the fallen Hollywood mogul helped cinch a guilty verdict that could send him to prison for up to 29 years. It was not just a stunning outcome for a case that had become a potent symbol of the #MeToo movement but also a sign of a striking shift toward a more sophisticated and comprehensive understanding of sexual assault and the complex effect of trauma on victims.
'This is one of those days when the whole world changes,' said Jane Manning, a former sex-crimes prosecutor in New York and director of the Women's Equal Justice Project. 'A sexual predator who was so powerful that he thought he could never be touched has just been held accountable.'
'A new era of justice,' proclaimed the leaders of Time's Up, an organization that pushes for harassment-free workplaces.
Weinstein once stood as a dominant force in the entertainment industry, a film producer who helped shape Oscar races and could make or break careers. Then a pair of explosive investigations published by the New York Times and the New Yorker in October 2017 detailed allegations of harassment and criminal sexual abuse that had taken place over decades. His accusers included high-profile Hollywood actresses who opened up about incidents long kept secret, and inspired numerous others to come forward with sexual misconduct claims against other prominent men, including Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer and Louis C.K., and prompted a larger cultural conversation about power and sexism.
Those stories had impact " Weinstein was fired from his production company and has been shunned by the industry " but many were doubtful that the accusers would ever find justice in a courtroom.
Deborah Tuerkheimer, a professor of law at Northwestern University, noted that most sexual assault cases that enter the legal system are more likely to fit the stereotypical 'stranger rape' paradigm " involving a woman who is assaulted by someone she doesn't know, resulting in apparent physical injury and, potentially, DNA evidence.
The Weinstein case, in contrast, presented a far more complicated portrait of sexual violence " and the fact that New York prosecutors even filed charges against him is 'extraordinary,' she said.
Most sexual assault 'is rarely reported, and when it gets reported it often does not result in an arrest, much less a prosecution or a conviction,' said Tuerkheimer, who is a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan. 'If we look out at the landscape of sexual assault, I think it has to count as progress that this kind of case, these kinds of allegations, ended up being pursued.'
The criminal charges in New York involved allegations from three women: former production assistant Mimi Haleyi, actress Annabella Sciorra, and Jessica Mann, a former acting hopeful with whom Weinstein had a five-year relationship. Three other accusers testified as supporting witnesses. The jury found Weinstein guilty of forcing a sex act on Haleyi in July 2006 and raping Mann in 2013. He still faces rape and sexual battery charges filed by prosecutors in Los Angeles on the first day of his Manhattan trial.
Laura Brevetti, a former federal prosecutor who has also handled sex crimes at the state level, said she was particularly struck that Weinstein was found guilty of raping Mann, who had said that the assault occurred during her long-term relationship with Weinstein. The defense introduced several flattering notes that Mann had written to Weinstein, aiming to undermine her credibility.
'Years ago when I was prosecuting sex crimes, we would almost think that would make it impossible to convince a jury' to convict, Brevetti said. 'People's attitudes have grown and developed, and so it may be less a surprise, but still I think even at this point in the evolution of our thinking, I was surprised by that.'
Scott Berkowitz, president of RAINN, an anti-sexual-violence organization, saw the verdict as a heartening indication that the public 'is understanding the nature of this crime, and the way that perpetrators go about it and are able to do it with impunity for so long.' He said he hoped that survivors who had followed the trial would feel encouraged to come forward, 'knowing that juries " and society " will believe them.'
Weinstein's conviction comes two years after Bill Cosby's, the first high-profile trial of the #MeToo era. In both instances, jurors heard from several women whose accusations were not included in the criminal charges that the men faced. Paul DerOhannesian II, a New York defense attorney and former sex-crimes prosecutor who wrote a two-volume text on sexual assault trials, said the use of supporting witnesses like this makes these cases notable.
But he also cautioned against viewing one verdict as signaling a sea change.
'What's shaping everyday cases? Are they being brought? What are juries doing? What are prosecutors doing? I don't think [the Weinstein verdict] answers those questions,' he said. 'But when these cases develop, it promotes discussion and dialogue, and that's important. It also promotes a legal discussion with the issues on appeal.'
Manning, of the Women's Equal Justice Project, believes that the legal system is ultimately shaped by the evolution of our culture and that Weinstein's verdict is proof of this " even if the transformation happens slowly.
'In the past two years, our culture has seen a momentous shift, and today that shift reached the courtroom,' Manning said. 'We shouldn't rest easy in the notion that everything is fine now: Look what it took for this man to be brought to trial, look how many women he got away with abusing, look how many women were further harmed by prosecutors before the D.A.'s office was forced to do the right thing. We still have a lot of work to do to create a criminal justice system that delivers justice to all women, including the most marginalized.'
But, she added: 'Today was one heck of a start.'

Texto completo: Prosecutors press for extradition of WikiLeaks founder in British court

LONDON " Attorneys for Julian Assange argued Monday that the Trump administration is targeting the WikiLeaks founder for political reasons and that he would be denied a fair trial if extradited to the United States.
They also cautioned that their client's mental health is 'fragile' and that he is at 'high risk of suicide.'
The Woolwich Crown Court proceeding marked a portentous new chapter in the long-running legal drama involving Assange.
His attorney Edward Fitzgerald told a packed courtroom next to Britain's high-security Belmarsh prison that the prosecution by the U.S. Justice Department was 'not motivated by genuine concerns for criminal justice but politics.'
U.S. prosecutors want the 48-year-old Australian to stand trial in federal court in Northern Virginia on charges that he violated the Espionage Act. Prosecutors allege that the anti-secrecy activist helped obtain and disseminate hundreds of thousands of pages of secret military documents and diplomatic cables regarding U.S. action in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to prosecutors, Assange helped Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, hack into government computers.
Fitzgerald argued that Assange would not receive a fair trial in the United States because of his foreign nationality and his political opinions.
The lawyer recalled that in 2017, then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo called WikiLeaks 'a nonstate hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.'
Further, Fitzgerald said, Assange could face 'inhuman and degrading treatment' in high-security isolation wings in U.S. prisons, as well as multiple life sentences.

Fitzgerald noted that the Obama administration in 2013 decided not to prosecute Assange, for fear that it would set a precedent that could ensnare journalists for publishing state secrets.
Fitzgerald asked what changed, saying, 'The answer is: President Trump came to power.'
The U.S. case for extradition was presented by James Lewis, who told the court that Assange was not a journalist but a hacker who conspired to publish stolen classified documents. The material was not redacted, Lewis stressed, and contained the names of sources who had assisted U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, thereby putting their lives in danger. He did not provide any examples of actual harm being done to the sources.

Lewis said WikiLeaks's initial publishing partners " the New York Times, the Guardian, El País, Der Spiegel and Le Monde " issued a joint statement saying they deplored the publishing of the sources' names.
Lewis said the crimes that Assange is alleged to have committed would also be prosecutable, under similar circumstances, in the United Kingdom under the Official Secrets Act. But he added that it was not for the British court to decide whether Assange is a patron of a free press, a hacker, a whistleblower or a journalist, but to turn him over to the United States for trial.
If found guilty of the 18 charges in U.S. court, Assange could face up to a 175-year sentence. But Lewis argued that it was hyperbolic for the defense to claim that Assange would receive that entire sentence, describing to the court more likely sentences of 48 or 63 months.
Speaking before District Judge Vanessa Baraitser, Lewis said Assange 'is not charged with disclosure of embarrassing or awkward information that the government would rather not have disclosed.' He is charged with conspiring to steal secret material.
Assange's supporters fear he would be forced to serve any sentence in the supermax federal facility in Florence, Colo., in solitary confinement, beside al-Qaeda terrorists, Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski, and Robert Hanssen, a former FBI agent who spied for Soviet and Russian intelligence services against the United States.
Assange's extradition proceedings are to be divided into two parts: this first week of legal arguments, followed by two or three weeks of witness testimony in May.
The court hearings are taking place beside the gray walls of Belmarsh prison, Assange's home since police dragged him from the Ecuadoran Embassy, where he had been living, in central London in April.
In pretrial hearings, Assange's attorneys signaled that they will argue their client acted as nothing more nefarious than a publisher and journalist " and that the prosecution is politically motivated, which should make extradition unlawful.

To bolster that assertion, Assange attorney Mark Summers has accused the CIA of spying on Assange, via a Spanish proxy, in the Ecuadoran Embassy. Further, Summers has asserted a link between the 'reinvigoration of the investigation' against Assange and Trump's presidency.
'This is part of an avowed war on whistleblowers to include investigative journalists and publishers,' Summers told the court last year. 'The American state has been actively engaged in intruding on privileged discussions between Mr. Assange and his lawyer.'
Last week, Assange's legal team again invoked Trump. A lawyer told the court that former congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), an ally of the president, offered to pardon Assange on Trump's behalf if the WikiLeaks founder would say that Russia had nothing to do with the 2016 hack and leak of emails from the Democratic National Committee.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the suggestion of a pardon offer 'a complete fabrication and a total lie.'
Experts in British extradition law say Assange's attorneys face a tough task.
Nick Vamos, a former head of extradition at Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, said British extradition courts are familiar with arguments about political motivation " just not in relation to requests from the United States.
'There is a very, very high degree of mutual trust and deference between two friendly nations,' Vamos said. 'So it takes an awful lot to persuade a U.K. court' that the U.S. system isn't fundamentally fair, 'however much political intrigue is swirling around.'
This is in contrast to extradition cases to nations such as Russia, Vamos said, 'where U.K. courts are actually quite ready to accept that somebody might not get a fair trial because [Vladimir] Putin or his cronies have got it in for them.'
Assange's case has drawn comparisons to that of Harry Dunn, whose family says it is hypocritical that Washington is demanding Assange when it refused to turn over Anne Sacoolas, an American diplomat's wife who is charged with causing the death of the British teenager. Sacoolas admitted she was driving on the wrong side of the road when she collided with Dunn as he was riding a motorcycle in August. She later fled Britain and claimed diplomatic immunity.

Harvey Weinstein Convicted of Some Sex Crimes, Acquitted of Others; Hollywood producer is taken to New York City jail after verdict; sentencing set for March 11

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of sex crimes involving two women but acquitted of the most severe charges he faced, a mixed verdict that nevertheless means the Hollywood producer faces the prospect of a lengthy prison term and delivers a victory to the #MeToo movement.
The verdict on Monday completed a fall from grace for Mr. Weinstein, whose Oscar-winning movie empire crumbled after sexual-misconduct allegations emerged from several women, including famous actresses.
After nearly 20 hours of deliberation following a six-week trial in New York City, the jury found Mr. Weinstein guilty of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape, and acquitted him of first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault. He faces between five and 25 years in prison on the criminal sexual-act charge and up to four years for third-degree rape.

New York State Supreme Court Justice James Burke ordered Mr. Weinstein, 67 years old, jailed until he is sentenced on March 11.
After the verdict was read, Mr. Weinstein's defense counsel recounted, the producer said, "I'm innocent, I'm innocent, I'm innocent. How could this happen in America?"
Authorities booked him Monday afternoon at the city's Rikers Island jail facility, where the judge requested that he be housed in the infirmary. The wrists of the once-powerful producer were handcuffed before he hobbled out of the courtroom with obvious difficulty, leaning on officers for support. Mr. Weinstein had used a walker during the course of the trial.
Later, Mr. Weinstein was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, said his attorneys, without disclosing the reason.
The trial marked the first serious legal test for the allegations that ignited the #MeToo movement i n 2017. It presented jurors with difficult issues involving the nature of sexual consent, the fallibility of memory over several decades and how rape victims interact with abusers after alleged sexual misconduct.
In convicting Mr. Weinstein of third-degree rape, the jury found that Mr. Weinstein had sex with aspiring actress Jessica Mann against her will in 2013 but determined that he didn't use the physical force or threats of immediate harm required of first-degree rape. The first-degree criminal sex act conviction stemmed from accusations that he forced oral sex on production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006.
As recently as Friday, the jury had suggested it couldn't come to an agreement on the charge of predatory sexual assault, which carried the most severe penalty of life in prison. The panel ultimately found there wasn't enough proof to convict Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct with "The Sopranos" actress Annabella Sciorra at her New York City apartment in the early 1990s.
Dozens of women have accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct, but the prosecutors presented the testimony of just six, who were often in tears as they testified. In her closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi described Mr. Weinstein as an "abusive rapist" and "predator" who not only assaulted the victims but also tried to bully them into silence.
Mr. Weinstein's defense spent weeks subjecting 28 prosecution witnesses to grueling cross examinations. They sought to undercut the women's narratives by pointing to their longstanding relationships with Mr. Weinstein after the alleged assaults.
In New York, legal experts say Justice Burke is unlikely to sentence him to the maximum. Mr. Weinstein still faces a second prosecution , in California, for felony sex crimes. Los Angeles prosecutors charged him with raping a woman after pushing his way inside her hotel room on Feb. 18, 2013, and sexually assaulting another woman the next night. If convicted, he faces up to 28 years in prison..
The charges and trial represented a stunning turn for Mr. Weinstein, who was once viewed as one of Hollywood's most skilled executives. Following reports in 2017 in the New York Times and the New Yorker about the allegations, he was fired as co-chairman of Weinstein Co., his independent movie and television studio. The studio's films included "Lee Daniels' The Butler," which grossed more than $100 million at the domestic box office. He was known as the Oscar-winning orchestrator behind hits like "Shakespeare in Love" and "The King's Speech."
Mr. Weinstein had denied having any nonconsensual sexual encounters.
Jurors declined to comment. Annette Vasquez, one of three alternate jurors who didn't deliberate with the others, said she viewed the actions of Mr. Weinstein and his accusers as tit for tat—they were "both looking for something" from each other.

"These girls were models, wanted to be actresses, so they figure he's a man of money, movies," the 51-year-old peace officer said of the testimony. But, sometimes the same men "tend to think they can get what they want because they have the money and the power."
The verdict marked a victory for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who was criticized for declining to prosecute Mr. Weinstein in 2015, when Italian model Ambra Gutierrez reported the producer groped her at his Tribeca office.
Mr. Vance said his office didn't have enough evidence to pursue what would have been misdemeanor charges then. "This case moved our understanding of what sexual assault is and where it can occur," the district attorney said Monday. "Rape is rape," he said. The six women who testified against Mr. Weinstein "changed the course of history," he said.
After the verdict, Mr. Weinstein's defense team and civil-rights attorney Gloria Allred simultaneously addressed reporters.
Lead defense attorney Donna Rotunno said Mr. Weinstein took the verdict "like a man."
"The fight is not over," she continued. His team plans to appeal.
Ms. Allred, who represented some of the accusers who testified, addressed the producer himself: "Harvey Weinstein, this justice has been a long time coming but it's finally here, and it's not the end."
"These women will not be silenced," she said. "They will still stand in their truth."
Ms. Mann, now a 34-year-old hairstylist, testified about a violent rape at the hands of Mr. Weinstein in March 2013 at the DoubleTree hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Then an aspiring actress, she said Mr. Weinstein ordered her to remove her clothing and blocked her from leaving the hotel room. She said she was so scared, she gave up and he had sex with her.
Ms. Mann kept in touch with Mr. Weinstein, writing him a month after the DoubleTree incident: "I appreciate all you do for me, it shows."
Ms. Haley testified that Mr. Weinstein, who was helping her find work at the time, invited her to his SoHo apartment in July 2006. He kissed and fondled her before backing her into a bedroom and "forced himself on me orally," she testified.
She said she didn't file a police report because she think didn't it was an option against the powerful Mr. Weinstein. The day after the alleged assault, Ms. Haley flew to Los Angeles on a ticket that Mr. Weinstein bought for her. When she returned two weeks later, she met Mr. Weinstein at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, where the two had sex.
Prosecutors presented testimony from an expert who said the women's behavior was commonly seen in sexual-assault victims.
The only silver lining for Mr. Weinstein was the acquittal on predatory sexual assault, the most severe charge. The crime requires more than one incident, and the judge allowed prosecutors to charge Mr. Weinstein under the statute for Ms. Sciorra's allegations even though the statute of limitations made her case too old to prosecute on its own.

Texto completo: On Monday, disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein was convicted on two of the five potential criminal charges he faced in his New York County sexual assault trial. Specifically, he has been found guilty of criminal sexual assault in the first degree and rape in the third degree. A sentencing hearing will be held at a later date. Weinstein was immediately sent to jail to await sentencing.
On the criminal sexual assault conviction, he is reportedly facing between five and 25 years. For the third-degree rape conviction, he is facing 18 months to four years.
The convictions Monday marked the end of a winding legal road in New York, though Weinstein still has a Los Angeles County case pending. To understand how we arrived at this point, after years of “open secrets” and rumors, here is the complete timeline of Weinstein’s #MeToo scandal, from the first explosive allegations to his conviction.
October 5, 2017: The New York Times publishes a report that details sexual misconduct accusations from eight separate women ranging from unwanted physical contact to sexual harassment. Among the accusers, actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd come forward publicly. Later, Weinstein issues a public apology that acknowledges that he “has caused a lot of pain” but denies any legal wrongdoing regarding harassment.
October 8, 2017: The Weinstein Co. fires Harvey Weinstein after he takes an indefinite leave of absence.
October 10, 2017: The New Yorker magazine publishes a report in which 13 more women come forward with accusations against Harvey Weinstein, including three accounts of rape. Weinstein again denies any legal wrongdoing. Actress Asia Argento, former aspiring actress Lucia Stoller and a third woman who remained anonymous all accuse the movie producer of forcing sexual acts. Mira Sorvino, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie all claim they were harassed by Weinstein. Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman, announces their separation.
October 14, 2017: Weinstein is expelled from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.
October 15, 2017: Actress Alyssa Milano publicly endorses the #MeToo movement, originally founded by Tarana Burke, by tweeting:
If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet. pic.twitter.com/k2oeCiUf9n
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 15, 2017
October 28, 2017: The New York Times reports on additional allegations made against Weinstein dating back to the 1970s.
November 3, 2017: Amid mounting claims and lawsuits against Weinstein, the NYPD say they “have an actual case here” and note that certain allegations are “credible.”
November 7, 2017: The New Yorker reports that Weinstein employed private investigators to cover up sexual abuse claims.
November 28, 2017: The first civil claim against Weinstein is filed in the United Kingdom High Court.
December 16, 2017: Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson tells Stuff.co.nz that Miramax, Weinstein’s former production outfit, supplied him with “false information” regarding Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd when Jackson was considering casting them. “I recall Miramax telling us they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs,” Jackson said, calling it a “smear campaign” against the actresses. Sorvino replied to the interview on Twitter with “There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career.”
December 19, 2017: A Page Six report claims that Weinstein attempted to coax $25 million out of Netflix to use as hush money prior to the New York Times and New Yorker ‘s reports detailing his alleged sexual misconduct were published. On the same day, Observer writer and former actress Jasmine Lobe accuses Harvey Weinstein and director James Toback of sexual harassment.
February 2, 2018: Actress Uma Thurman reveals her own sexual harassment experiences with Weinstein in a New York Times article by columnist Maureen Dowd. Weinstein’s camp again deny all allegations.
February 11, 2018: Following a four-month investigation, New York state prosecutors announce that they have filed a lawsuit against The Weinstein Company for failing to protect employees from Weinstein’s alleged behavior.
March 20, 2018: The Weinstein Co. files for bankruptcy. It is later acquired by the Texas-based private-equity firm Lantern Capital.
May 25, 2018: Weinstein surrenders to New York police. He is charged with rape and separate sexual assaults against two women.
May 25, 2018: Weinstein is released on $1 million bail under the agreement that he will wear a GPS tracker and surrender his passport.
May 31, 2018: Weinstein is indicted by a New York grand jury on charges of rape and a criminal sexual act. The case—revolving around charges stemming from a 2004 and 2013 incident—is now heading to trial.
June 5, 2018: Weinstein formally pleads not guilty to the charges.
June 9, 2018: Weinstein pleads not guilty to new sexual assault charges by a third woman.
October 11, 2018: A New York judge dismisses the sexual assault charge stemming from a 2006 incident. Two separate charges remain.

May 24, 2019: Weinstein and The Weinstein Co. board reach a reported $44 million settlement in the class action civil suit to offer compensation to alleged victims. The reported figure would change several times throughout the remainders of Weinstein’s trial.
July 11, 2019: Donna Rotunno and Damon Cheronis are hired as defense attorneys after Weinstein’s previous legal team—Jose Baez, Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., Pamela Robillard Mackey and Duncan Levin—withdraws from the case.

January 6, 2020: Hours before Weinstein appears in New York court for the start of his trial on a rape charge, Los Angeles prosecutors announce sexual assault charges against him.
January 6, 2020: Weinstein’s rape trial in New York begins.

Specifically, Weinstein is convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping former actress Jessica Mann in 2013. He is acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault, which could have carried sentences of life in jail.

Texto completo: The 23-year-old woman killed last week in a head-on collision in Hampton had just started her career as an assistant softball coach at Chatham University.
Kaitlyn Eckelberry was pronounced dead at 12:03 a.m. Saturday after the 11:51 p.m. crash Friday on the 3800 block of Route 8.
In a campuswide email Monday morning, dean of students Heather Black said Ms. Eckelberry "made a great impact within the [softball] program in her short time and we will miss her very much."
Ms. Eckelberry was officially hired as a part-time assistant coach in January after working as a volunteer coach during the fall, according to university officials.
In a press release issued by Gannon University, Ms. Eckelberry's alma mater, softball coach Michelle Wiley said: "When I think of Katie, I always smile because she had such a beautiful soul and such a passion for life and softball. She was an amazing student, teammate, athlete, sister, daughter and most recently coach. She had such a positive impact on everyone she came in contact with."
Allegheny County homicide detectives and the department's Collision Reconstruction Unit reported that it appeared a Jeep Cherokee crossed the center line and struck the Hyundai Elantra driven by Ms. Eckelberry. The Jeep's driver, also 23, was critically injured.
Ms. Eckelberry was born in Akron, Ohio, and most recently lived with her parents in Canton, Ohio. She graduated from Gannon with a bachelor's of science in 2018, and then earned her master's of physician assistance science at the university in 2019, according to an online obituary.
In the statement, Ms. Wiley said, "She was a perfect example of a successful student-athlete. She was one of the hardest workers that I have ever known both on and off the field. She pushed herself and her teammates to get better every day."
A moment of silence will be held in Ms. Eckelberry's honor at the women's basketball playoff game on Monday at 7 p.m. in Chatham University's Athletic & Fitness Center, and Tuesday night at the men's basketball playoff game at 7 p.m. at the same location.
Funeral services will be held at the Queen of Heaven Church in Uniontown, Ohio, on Friday.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders is causing the Democratic establishment acute heartburn, with many party regulars worried the socialist Vermont senator is throwing away a golden opportunity to defeat President Trump.

As Sanders, 78, has cemented front-runner status in the Democratic primary, veteran party operatives, prominent liberal figures and elected officials are sounding the alarm. It’s not unlike Republican establishment freak-out as Trump barreled toward the GOP nomination four years ago. Top Democrats warn that Sanders would lose to the president and be a disaster for the party down-ticket. Here is a sampling:

Mark Mellman, veteran Democratic pollster based in Washington
“Democrats say defeating Trump is what’s most important to them … We think Sanders is very poorly positioned to do that.” The Guardian, January 31, 2020
Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas
“I'm a Democrat … I think it would be difficult to have a socialist at the top of the ticket. I think he clarifies it and says 'a democratic socialist,' but a socialist is a socialist, whether it's Republican socialist or democratic socialist, if there is such a thing." The Hill, February 11, 2020
Rahm Emanuel, former Chicago mayor and Barack Obama’s first White House chief of staff.
“In the last hundred years, three Democrats have won reelection for president: Franklin Roosevelt, President Clinton, Barack Obama,” Emanuel said. Their strategies were based on assembling "an urban, suburban, metropolitan coalition,” he continued. “Bernie is saying ‘Forget that. Screw it … Basically, there are about 70 million socialists ready to be awoken to their inner socialist. And I would just say to you if our No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 goal is to get rid of Donald Trump, it is a really big risk to go on a political strategy that has never been tried before.” The Hill, February 25, 2020
Hillary Clinton, Democratic nominee for president in 2016
"He was in Congress for years. He had one senator support him. Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician. It's all just baloney, and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it."
The Hollywood Reporter, January 21, 2020
Joe Lieberman, Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000 and former Connecticut senator
“When you look at [Sanders’s] programs, it would change America. The government would take over most of the economy, and if his programs, as he’s advocated, were ever adopted, America would be bankrupt. Fox Business, February 12, 2020
Sen. Jon Tester of Montana
"I come from a state that's pretty damn red. There is no doubt that having 'socialist' ahead of 'Democrat' is not a positive thing in the state of Montana … He can overcome that, but I think it's something he's going to have to do." Associated Press, January 8, 2020
Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia
“Absolutely not,” Manchin said, when asked if he would support Sanders’s agenda. Asked what Manchin would do if the choice before him in November is Sanders or Trump, he replied, “It wouldn’t be Bernie.” Fox News, October 30, 2019
James Carville, Democratic strategist, former adviser to President Bill Clinton.
"Last night on CNN, Bernie Sanders called me a political hack … That’s exactly who the f--- I am! I am a political hack! I am not an ideologue. I am not a purist. He thinks it’s a pejorative. I kind of like it! At least I’m not a communist.” The Hill, February 13, 2020
Chris Matthews, host of MSNBC’s “Hardball”
"I was reading last night about the fall of France in the summer of 1940 … And the general, Reynaud, calls up Churchill and says, 'It's over.' And Churchill says: 'How can that be? You've got the greatest army in Europe. How can it be over?' He said, 'It's over.' So I had that suppressed feeling." Matthews later apologized for these remarks. February 22, 2020
Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, who has endorsed Joe Biden.
“If Bernie Sanders was at the top of the ticket, we would be in jeopardy of losing the House … We would not get the Senate back.” The New York Times, February 12, 2020
Jeff Hewitt, veteran Texas Democratic consultant
“Sanders is a complete disaster … At the end of the day, most of us want to win.” Politico, February 15, 2020
Matt Bennett, the executive vice-president for public affairs at Third Way, a center-left thinktank.
“There is a deep treasure trove of stuff from Bernie’s background – all of the radical things he’s said and done over the years – that the Trump campaign could circulate … He is without question the candidate Trump hopes to have as an opponent in November.” The Guardian, January 31, 2020
Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey
“I always find it interesting that he gives a passing glance to the question of authoritarianism, but then dwells on all the alleged good things … So it's just not what I would want to see in the person who would be the leader of the free world.” CNN’s Manu Raju, February 25, 2020
Rep. Joe Cunningham of South Carolina
“South Carolinians don’t want socialism … We want to know how you are going to get things done and how you are going to pay for them. Bernie’s proposals to raise taxes on almost everyone is not something the low country wants and not something I’d ever support.” The Post and Courier, February 12, 2020
Steve Israel of New York, former chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
“Donald Trump will paint every Democrat — whether they’re running for U.S. Senate or county sheriff — as a socialist, as a ‘Bernie Sanders socialist’ … And that’s a tough deal in a lot of these [House] districts.” The New York Times, February 12, 2020
Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who has endorsed Sen. Amy Klobuchar
“I’m the first Democrat to win in my district since 1958 … I attracted a lot of independent and moderate Republican support, many of whom probably voted for a Democrat for the first time in a long time. And while I respect Bernie Sanders as a senator, as a candidate, his candidacy is very challenging for people who come from districts like mine.” The New York Times, February 12, 2020
Joe Lockhart, White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton, in
“The Democratic establishment gave us civil rights, voting rights, the assault weapons ban, social security and Medicare. What have you done Senator?” Tweet, February 21, 2020
Rep. Scott Peters of California, who is backing Mike Bloomberg.
“Sanders is about the worst candidate we can put up. He not only won’t likely win the presidency; he puts the House majority at risk.” The Hill, February 11, 2020
Rep. Max Rose of New York, another Bloomberg backer.
“I’m not a socialist. I’m thinking about printing T-shirts saying as much. I think socialist economic policies fail, inevitably.” The Hill, February 11, 2020
Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania
“In the most important election of our lives, Sen. @BernieSanders & Rep. @AOC are celebrating a bill that would eliminate thousands of good union jobs in #PA17 & across PA — a state we need to win … What are we doing? We are Democrats. Jobs come first.” Tweet, February 14, 2020

Val Arkoosh, county commissioner in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania
“Montgomery County is home to many moderate Republicans, and I hear from them with some regularity that they are interested in having a different president … But they do have concerns over some of the more deeply progressive policies that are being espoused by Senator Sanders, so I think it could affect turnout from people who wouldn’t necessarily always vote Democratic.” The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 22, 2020
Kathy Harrington, first vice chair of the Lehigh County Democratic Party
“I’m in the car with someone right now who said she wouldn’t vote for Bernie Sanders even though she’s a Democrat. She’s making a gag noise right now.” The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 22, 2020
Ben LaBolt, former adviser to President Barack Obama
"He's more concerned about shouting in the wilderness to make an ideological point than getting things done." Associated Press, January 8, 2020
Marshall Matz, policy adviser to George McGovern, Democratic nominee for president in 1972
"I think he would not just lose but would lose badly — and I don't think the country can afford that." Associated Press, January 8, 2020

Texto completo: Back during the scandal over his sexual exploitation of a young intern, Bill Clinton was pilloried in this space for his moral defects.
To which many liberals responded with derision. Morality? What did that matter? The economy was good, we were at peace and Clinton was hardly the first man to fool around and lie about it. As one reader put it, he was hired to be a president, not a pope.
At the time, that felt like a rationalization. A generation later, it feels like a portent. Indeed, it is often said that we are living now in Post-Fact America but truth is, we are also living in Post-Integrity America.
No, that’s not breaking news. But it’s been brought into painfully clear focus these last few days.
One watched - not with surprise anymore, the capacity for that being long lost, but surely with dread and fascination - as Donald Trump launched his post-impeachment purge of aides deemed insufficiently sycophantic. But that was just a prelude.
Last week, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 people, most of them guilty of lying, fraud, corruption, tax evasion and similar crimes. In other words, the kinds of things of which Trump has often been accused.
The power to soften or wipe away criminal convictions is one of the nicer perks of the presidency, allowing compassion to be shown to those who deserve it. And in fairness, several of those who benefited last week seem to meet that standard. Crystal Munoz, for instance, had been sentenced to almost 20 years for dealing pot.
But it is worth noting that every person Trump pardoned or gave clemency came to his attention not through the normal machinery of government, but through inside connections or else, as The New York Times noted, “were promoted on Fox News.” Some were championed by aides and allies. Some had donated big money to his campaign. And again, most had breached the public trust.
Like former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who had served eight years of a 14-year sentence for trying to sell Barack Obama’s vacated Senate seat. Trump, who has opined how unfair it is that U.S. companies are not allowed to pay bribes to do business overseas, had called that sentence “ridiculous.”
It’s no great leap to suggest that he sees himself in Blagojevich. Or in former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and financier Michael Milken, whom he pardoned for tax fraud and securities fraud, respectively. If granting clemency and pardons opens a window upon a president’s moral priorities - and it does - the view offered here suggests an unfortunate affinity for scammers and grifters, an empathy for those on the make, cutting deals, cutting corners, living the dream, until they got caught up by pesky rules designed to enforce integrity. And if those same people happened to give him money or had their names whispered into his ear by a friend, so much the better.
That’s not how this is supposed to work. And that it is working this way right out in the open, before our very eyes, suggests - no, screams - Trump’s imperviousness to any sense of ethical affront.
During Clinton’s scandal, it was argued in this space that a president stamps himself upon an era “not simply by legislative accomplishment, but also … by dint of personal authority and moral suasion.”
Trump disproves that. He has stamped himself upon this era while ignoring the very idea of personal authority or moral suasion - and daring us to care. But we had better. By his lack of personal character, Trump threatens our national character. And he stamps this era with the signature lesson of his life:

Texto completo: Name a candidate who mocks physical characteristics, suggests the press is strategically reporting the news to harm election results, puts labels on rivals, or distorts the truth about the past.
That’s not just President Trump talking.
With the primary at a critical point, Democratic presidential candidates are echoing their biggest villain as they feel pressure to make a splash ahead of Saturday's South Carolina primary and the March 3 Super Tuesday nominating contests.
Mocking Bloomberg’s height
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren most blatantly took a page out of Trump’s playbook when she mocked billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s height.
"I want to talk specifically for just a minute at the top about a threat that is coming our way. And it's a big threat — not a tall one, but a big one: Michael Bloomberg,” Warren said in a speech Saturday as results from Nevada’s presidential nominating contests trickled in.
Other vicious Warren attacks on Bloomberg center on allegations of inappropriate comments to women, that he is attempting to “buy” the presidency with his $62 billion fortune, and his onetime support for “stop-and-frisk” policing tactics that disproportionately targeted communities of color.
But Warren’s swipe at a physical characteristic rather than a substantive issue was undeniably similar to Trump’s frequent taunts referencing Bloomberg’s below-average 5-foot-8-inch stature by nicknaming him “Mini Mike.”
Trump went so far as to claim falsely earlier this month that “Mini Mike” was trying to negotiate the “the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates.”
Brushing off accusations from women
Warren, however, suggests that it is Bloomberg who is similar to Trump.
“I’d like to talk about who we’re running against: a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians.' And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump. I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg,” Warren said in last week’s Democratic presidential debate, referring to alleged comments Bloomberg made about members of the royal family.
Bloomberg himself offered a Trump-like retort by brushing off Warren hammering him to release women who accused him or his company of sexual harassment or gender discrimination from nondisclosure agreements.
“None of them accuse me of doing anything, other than maybe they didn't like a joke I told,” Bloomberg said in last week’s debate.
In response to a May 2016 New York Times expose on how Trump treated women in private, Trump claimed that “the women all stepped forward and said it was a joke.”
A few days after the debate, Bloomberg said his company found three nondisclosure agreements with women who accused him of wrongdoing and would release them from the agreement if they wished.
Calling Sanders a communist
Bloomberg also echoed Trump with an attack on socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the debate by suggesting he was promoting communism.
“We're not going to throw out capitalism. We tried. Other countries tried that. It was called communism, and it just didn't work,” Bloomberg said. Members of the audience booed in response.
Earlier this month, Trump directly slapped the communist label on Sanders. “I think he’s a communist. I mean, you know, look — I think of communism when I think of Bernie,” Trump said.
Accusing press of intentionally harming electoral outcome
Sanders also faces allegations of behaving like Trump. On Friday, he suggested that a Washington Post report that U.S. officials briefed his campaign on Russian efforts to assist his presidential bid was published the day before Nevada's Democratic caucuses in order to harm his chances in the contest.
“I’ll let you guess about one day before the, the Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out?" Sanders told reporters on Friday. When informed of the outlet that reported it, he said, “It was the Washington Post? Good friends.”
Trump on Sunday pushed a similar theory that the story was leaked to hurt Sanders.
“The Democrats are treating Bernie Sanders very unfairly. And it sounds to me like a leak — a leak from Adam Schiff, because they don't want Bernie Sanders to represent them. It sounds like it's '16 all over again for Bernie Sanders,” the president said.
And Trump famously accuses the press of working against him.
“The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm president and they're not,” Trump said during a 2017 rally. “The media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary,” he said at a November 2019 rally.
In response to the Vermont senator’s comment, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s campaign on Saturday compared Sanders to Trump, accusing him of “fueling conspiracy theories” and promoting a “toxic politics.”
Turns of phrase
As Sanders racks up wins in early nominating contests, he is getting looser on the stump and using turns of phrase eerily similar to those that Trump uses.
“Don’t tell anybody, I don’t want to get them nervous. We are going to win the Democratic primary in Texas,” Sanders said at a San Antonio rally on Saturday. “And you know, this is also important, the president gets very, very upset easily, so don’t tell him that we’re going to beat him here in Texas.”
Trump uses a similar tone when he tells crowds to not tell others about things he very much wants to be publicized.
“We’ve rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don’t tell anybody, but we spent $2.5 trillion,” Trump said during a rally last week. “New slogan is Keep America Great. But don't tell anybody,” Trump said at a November 2018 rally.
And Sanders echoed Trump’s frequent boasting about crowd size and those unable to fit in the venue.
“There are a lot of people here, and there are a lot of people outside who couldn’t get inside,” Sanders said at a rally Saturday in El Paso.
Distortions of policy and the past
Joe Biden’s core campaign message is on “restoring” the country after the Trump era. He frequently blasts the president's demeanor, but even the former vice president has been accused of Trump similarities.
Sanders last year accused Biden of “sounding like Donald Trump” with his criticism of Sanders’s signature Medicare for All single-payer healthcare plan that would eliminate private insurance. Biden said the program would eliminate Obamacare.
The Sanders campaign has also criticized Biden for refusing to admit he was "dead wrong" by voting in favor of the Iraq War in 2002 and falsely claiming that he opposed the Iraq War "from the moment" the March 2003 invasion started.
A New York Times investigation also found there is no evidence supporting Biden's claim that he was once arrested in South Africa.
Trump often distorts or stretches the truth on his record or accomplishments, though the president's false claims are much more egregious and frequent than Biden's.

Harvey Weinstein conviction should remind everyone what #MeToo was really about

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein’s conviction as a rapist in New York should serve as a really nice reminder that the #MeToo movement was about bringing down powerful men who, under the weight of substantial evidence and a reckoning within Hollywood and the media, finally got what was coming.
A couple of years after the initial New York Times report exposing Weinstein, though, the social justice movement has attempted, with much success, at co-opting it.
Now, every claim of sexual harassment or assault, corroborated or not, is considered a #MeToo milestone.
#MeToo was created for Weinstein (who from the start admitted to wrongdoing), former Sen. Al Franken (who from the start admitted to wrongdoing), and journalist Mark Halperin (who from the start admitted to wrongdoing). But with a sleight of hand and a helpful push from the media, almost everything is now considered a case of #MeToo.
“Believe all women” was the Hillary Clinton doctrine (except the ones who accused her husband).
But as described in my new book, Privileged Victims: How America’s Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People, that standard has wreaked a lot of havoc on the lives of men who may very well be innocent.
College-aged men are facing this problem across the country on campuses where simple regret is now synonymous with sexual misconduct.
Countless male students have had their reputations called into question and ruined by ridiculous claims of sexual assault and harassment, all of which are now, according to the social justice mob, the same thing as the Weinstein-style #MeToo accusations.
Weinstein faced a mountain of evidence, including audio recordings, that corroborated his accusers’ claims. He is what #MeToo was created for.

Don’t let Democrats downplay Bernie Sanders’s radicalism

Texto completo: It looks increasingly likely that Democrats will march into the 2020 election under the Red Flag.
After Sen. Bernie Sanders’s landslide win in Saturday’s Nevada caucuses, the elderly socialist's front-runner status is cemented. This spells electoral nightmare for the party, so it’s perfectly reasonable that the Democratic establishment and liberal media are up in arms over the Vermont independent's remarkable rise. But their actual responses are far from reasonable and range from emotionally unhinged to intellectually dishonest.
The most dangerous response has been from those establishment Democrats, so united in their hatred for President Trump and partisan loyalty, that they are already beginning to downplay the radicalism posed by Sanders’s candidacy.
The New York Times’s Paul Krugman, for instance, has carried water with a newfound fervor for Sanders over the last few weeks. Krugman wrote an entire column about why, even though Sanders openly calls himself a socialist, has praised socialist and communist dictators his entire career, and is running on a socialist agenda, he is somehow not actually a socialist. Now, Krugman has another article out dismissing concerns over Sanders’s economic agenda, and saying backing him over Trump is easy because “freedom is on the line.”
(Remember: Krugman is the same Nobel Prize-winning economist who predicted the internet wouldn’t significantly effect the economy and warned that the stock market would “never recover” if Trump won.)
This kind of left-of-center media coverage, downplaying Sanders’s radicalism, has ratcheted up recently, as evidenced by Krugman’s column, similar pieces in Vox, Quartz, Newsweek, and too many other examples to count. So, too, Sanders's rise has spawned an entire genre of social media commentary where glib liberals minimize Sanders’s extremism and make it sound like backing him over Trump would be a no-brainer.TweetTweetTweetTweetTweet
Don’t fall for it.
Sanders is an open, self-described socialist whose proposals would destroy the economy, crush free enterprise, and frankly, put us on the same path that Venezuela went down when they elected Hugo Chavez.
It is dishonest to say Sanders is “just a social democrat” or “just wants the U.S. to be like Denmark.” Social Democracy is not the same as "democratic socialism." The former is a free-market system with a welfare state. The latter is Bolshevism, an existential threat to societal wealth and human life.
The policy platform Sanders is running on is not just some modest expansion of the welfare state to cover more people. He has openly professed support for nationalizing or de-facto nationalizing entire industries, such as healthcare, banking, and even the internet.
Sanders’s total proposed government spending would have the government account for 70% of the economy. In fact, according to the Cato Institute’s Ryan Bourne, Sanders’s agenda is even more radical than that of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, which is considered a very left-wing socialist party in its own right.
So Sanders's agenda is about as socialist as you can get without going full communist. Not that Sanders would necessarily be opposed to that, seeing as he has a long history of defending communist dictators. He even honeymooned in the Soviet Union.
And it’s simply false to claim the socialist presidential aspirant simply wants to turn the United States into a “social democracy” similar to Denmark.
The Danes actually have a somewhat lightly-regulated, market-based economy. Denmark’s former prime minister himself rejected Sanders's assertion that his country was “socialist.” Sanders’s platform on issues such as healthcare and taxation much more closely resembles communist Cuba than Denmark.
As for the argument that he’d be tied back by the legislative branch, well, Sanders openly touts his plans to circumvent constitutional constraints to enact his agenda via executive order if the Senate won’t go along with it. So much for that.
The Democratic establishment and the liberal media’s nascent effort to downplay Sanders’s radicalism truly is alarming. If voters are going to elect the socialist senator, they at least need to know what they’re getting us all into.

MSNBC analyst rebukes colleague Chris Matthews for comparing Sanders win in Nevada to Nazi invasion

Texto completo: MSNBC political analyst Anand Giridharadas criticized his colleague, network host Chris Matthews, after Matthews compared Sen. Bernie Sanders's win in the Nevada caucuses to the Nazi invasion of France.
Giridharadas appeared on AM Joy Sunday morning to discuss a recent opinion piece he wrote in the New York Times in which he criticized former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's presidential bid while addressing the larger issue of billionaires in the race. He then broached the "wake-up moment for the American power establishment" through Sanders's success in the Nevada contest over the weekend.
“Why is Chris Matthews on this air talking about the victory [of] Bernie Sanders, who had kin murdered in the Holocaust, analogizing it to the Nazi conquest of France?” Giridharadas said. “People stuck in an old way of thinking, in 20th century thinking are missing what is going on. It is time for all of us to step up, rethink the dawn of what may be, frankly, a new era in American life.”
MSNBC contributor rebukes colleague Chris Matthews for comparing Sanders Nevada win to Nazi invasion
On Saturday, Matthews likened the self-proclaimed socialist's decisive victory in Nevada's caucuses to the Nazi's victory over France in World War II.
"I was reading last night about the fall of France in the summer of 1940," Matthews said during MSNBC's coverage of the caucuses. "And the general, Reynaud, calls up Churchill and says, 'It's over.' And Churchill says, 'How can that be? You've got the greatest army in Europe. How can it be over?' He said, 'It's over.'"
Matthews's comments, which spurred calls for his resignation, are the latest in a series of anti-Sanders commentary he's made on the air.
Matthews recently accused Sanders of being "full of it," arguing that he'd be a "miserable president" if the senator got elected. Matthews also predicted that Sanders would lose 49 states if he went up against President Trump in the general election.
The Vermont senator reportedly berated MSNBC executives last week for what he perceived to be unfair treatment.

Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party have pulled each other to the left

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders is on track for success in a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination based on his record of decades of unwavering support for left-wing policies once far out of the mainstream.
But the party has also pulled the longtime self-described socialist to the left, on cultural issues: Immigration, guns, and matters related to race.
Sanders, 78, for years has favored sweeping liberal reforms, such as universal government-financed healthcare and a much higher minimum wage, sticking to unapologetic left-wing politics even when there appeared to be no market for them, as when Bill Clinton, the incumbent Democratic president declared in 1996 that “the era of big government is over.”
Yet, during his time representing Vermont in Congress as a representative from 1991 to 2007 and since then as a senator, Sanders also staked out positions in sync with the state’s rural white population and well to the right of where the party is today.
On immigration, for instance, Sanders for years was relatively restrictionist, opposing legislation to liberalize immigration for which endorsement is a litmus test among Democrats today.
“He definitely has shifted over the years,” said Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for tighter immigration controls.
Most notably, Sanders voted against a 2007 bipartisan bill that many liberal immigration groups viewed as the best chance in many years to enact comprehensive immigration reform. The legislation split Democrats, and Sanders sided with the labor left in opposing it on the grounds that it would put workers at a disadvantage by boosting guest worker programs.
“I think this Senate should be spending much more of its time making it easier to create decent-paying jobs for American workers, instead of allowing corporate America to drive down wages by importing more and more workers from overseas,” Sanders said of the bill then.
Earlier in his congressional career, Sanders was vigilantly opposed to guest workers taking jobs that could be filled by U.S. citizens, for instance by asking the Labor Department to investigate layoffs at the Killington ski resort in 2007 out of suspicion the jobs might go to guest workers.
Yet in future years, he became a more reliably liberal vote on immigration. He voted for the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” immigration reform bill in 2013 and favored executive action by President Barack Obama on behalf of young people brought to the United States illegally.
In the 2016 Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton, who had voted for the 2007 bill, sought to penalize Sanders for opposing it, saying in a debate that the measure was “our best chance.”
In running for president this year, Sanders’s platform is in line with those of other liberal candidates. Where he called in 2007 for strengthening the border and making it harder to migrate to the U.S. illegally, he now favors a moratorium on deportations and decriminalizing border crossings.
“He’s gone from principled objections because of the impact on American workers, to being oblivious to the concerns of … Or, at least appearing to be oblivious to the effects of mass migration, such as we have today, on American workers,” said Vaughan.
On guns, too, Sanders has erased the distance between his own positions of years past when he supported gun rights in rural Vermont and those of the contemporary Democratic Party.
“People of Vermont have changed, and I certainly have changed on that issue,” Sanders acknowledged in an interview with the New York Times editorial board published in January.
Sanders’s past support for gun rights was critical, rather than incidental, to his candidacy for federal office. In running for the House in 1990, he earned the support of the NRA over the incumbent Republican because he pledged to oppose a measure mandating waiting periods for handgun purchases.
For many years thereafter, Sanders maintained a relatively pro-gun rights voting record.
As late as 2007, Gun Owners of American spokesman Michael Hammond pointed out as a representative example, Sanders voted for a measure to prevent any foreign aid funding to go to groups that require registration or taxation of guns owned by U.S. citizens.

Sanders’s record on gun control allowed Hillary Clinton and other rivals to attack him from his left in the 2016 race, even as he noted that he had a D-minus grade from the NRA. Put on the defensive, he underwent a role reversal: While usually it was Sanders calling for a political revolution and dismissing rivals’ criticisms that his plans were unrealistic, in the case of guns, he was left arguing for pragmatism and realism.
“We can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not,” he said in the Oct. 13, 2015, debate.
Even before his 2016 run, though, Sanders began voting more reliably against gun rights and backed legislation to reverse a 2005 bill he voted for that protected gun makers from legal liability.
“He has changed,” said Hammond. “I suspect the people of Vermont haven’t changed commensurately.”
Sanders has also evolved on the issue of race, which has been tied during his presidential candidacy to criminal justice policy.
The rise of Black Lives Matter has caused a reckoning within the Democratic Party over its policies on criminal justice, most significantly regarding the 1994 crime bill signed by Bill Clinton that resulted in greater incarceration, particularly of minorities.
Sanders, as a member of the House, voted for that legislation.
In 2016, his campaign said that he voted for the bill because it contained the Violence Against Women Act and an assault weapons ban, and that he opposed the elements that generated greater incarceration, such as provisions that generated added mandatory minimum sentences.
This election cycle, he’s said more forthrightly that he regrets voting for the legislation, saying last year that it was a “terrible bill.”
Twice on the campaign trail in the 2016 cycle, Sanders had events disrupted by Black Lives Matters activists making demands regarding criminal justice reform.
Sanders also drew criticism from the Left for his rhetorical approach to race and Black Lives Matter. Atlantic writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, for instance, criticized him for viewing the problems facing black Americans through the lens of class, as opposed to race, and for dismissing the concept of reparations out of hand.
Sanders still hasn’t endorsed reparations, as have some of his 2020 Democratic rivals, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. He has, however, changed the way he talks about the idea, making sure to identify racism as a major problem in discussing his economic agenda.
“As a result of slavery, and segregation, and the institutional racism we see now in healthcare, in education, in financial services, we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America, including African American communities,” he said in the July debate when asked about reparations.
Still, his own campaign staff sees Sanders’s evolution on race issues as a work in progress. “Obviously, we’ve got to do a better job of communicating that record and that vision,” his adviser Jeff Weaver told Time magazine in July. Weaver said that he needs to convey his ideas “in a culturally competent way.”
Sanders has worked to educate himself on black Americans’ experience with the criminal justice system in the years following his first presidential run and has noted his own evolution.
At a 2018 event in Los Angeles hosted by Real Justice, a group that backs “reform-minded” prosecutors, Sanders discussed what he saw as the biggest failures of the criminal justice system and their effects on minorities, such as the prevalence of cash bail. Sanders has described cash bail as creating the equivalent of debtors’ prison and has called for ending it.
“Five years ago, I did not know these things, like many Americans,” Sanders said as he ran down the list of his criticisms of the criminal justice system. “But I’m learning and I’m learning fast.”

Is the Intelligence Community planning to meddle in 2020 election?

Texto completo: Recently, the Intelligence Community made clear it will be a player in the 2020 presidential election. No one should be surprised.
On Feb. 13, the House Intelligence Committee held a meeting at which intelligence officials briefed lawmakers on foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections. By several accounts, the officials told the committee that Russia is working to reelect President Trump.
A number of Republican committee members were deeply skeptical. What the officials said was classified, so they cannot discuss it publicly, but, in conversations later, GOP lawmakers made it clear that the intelligence officials did not have the evidence to support the assertion.
"How should reporting take place?" one member said later. "You would say, 'We believe X is true based on A, B, C, and D.' When that doesn't happen, it's very suspect."
"If you're going to make an accusation like that, you darn well better be ready to answer questions and have evidence to support it," said another member. When pressed, the member added that officials gave "very vague and unsatisfying answers."
The Republicans' objection was not to the idea that Russia is trying to interfere in a U.S. election. That is an accepted fact. The problem was the assessment that Russia is specifically trying to help reelect Trump. That claim, so incendiary in the 2016 election, was unsupported by the evidence, they said.
As they left the meeting, Republicans agreed that the news would leak soon. It almost seemed to be why Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee chairman and impeachment leader, called the meeting in the first place.
No one was surprised when, a week later, the New York Times published a story, "Lawmakers Are Warned That Russia Is Meddling to Re-elect Trump." The news quickly became another one of those bombshell reports that consume hours of talk on cable TV.
Democrats, who were also barred by law from revealing classified information, were nevertheless happy to play along. For example, not long after the story broke, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, an intelligence committee member, appeared on CNN.
"I can't talk about what happened in a classified setting," Himes said. "But ... you don't need an intelligence briefing to think about what Vladimir Putin might want. Would he want a return to sort of conventional, much more confrontational policy with respect to Russia? Or might he want a president who will criticize everybody on the planet except Vladimir Putin?"
Himes's point was clear: I can't talk about it, but of course Putin is working to reelect Trump.
The problem was, intelligence officials did not have the evidence to make that assertion, and, almost as soon as the story broke, officials with knowledge of the meeting suggested that the headlines were wrong. On Sunday, CNN reported the officials had apparently "overstated" the Putin-wants-Trump story.
And then there were the circumstances of the briefing. The Intelligence Community works for the president. Yet, officials chose to brief Schiff's House Intelligence Committee on this extraordinarily consequential finding before telling the president.
Whatever the motive, spilling the beans in a room with dozens of people present — intelligence officials brought a lot of staff with them — increased the chances of precisely the type of leak that occurred.
The whole thing hit the White House by surprise. "I have not seen that analysis," national security adviser Robert O'Brien told ABC on Sunday, referring to the Putin-wants-Trump assessment. "I've been with the leaders of the intelligence committee. They don't have it. So, if there's some lower-level people at [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] that came in and gave this analysis to the House — look, I'd like to see it. But I haven't seen it."
Later, just to make matters more difficult, there were leaks that Russia is also trying to help elect Bernie Sanders. The leak left many experts baffled, except to the extent that, with the Trump leak, it seemed to target the Intelligence Community's two least-favorite candidates.
There were lots of reports that Trump was angry after the news broke, and why shouldn't he be angry? Way back in January 2017, when Trump was president-elect and protesting that the Intelligence Community was out to get him, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer famously said, "You take on the Intelligence Community, they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you."
The years that followed proved that to be true. And it still is.

'I’ve been working side by side with the president': Former White House doctor touts Trump ties in House race

Texto completo: President Trump's former White House doctor is touting his close ties to D.C. as he pitches himself to Texas voters in the 13th Congressional District.
"I just came from the White House. I’ve been working side by side with the president. I know all the cabinet secretaries. I have their cellphones. I know the chief of staff, the national security adviser," Ronny Jackson, who is running for the House seat currently held by retiring GOP Rep. Mac Thornberry, said at a Harley-Davidson store in Wichita Falls during a candidate forum last week.
"I can pick the phone up, and I can call them," he added. "They’re all friends of mine."
Trump tapped the physician to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2018, a bid that was scuttled by charges of workplace misconduct. The president went to bat for Jackson, who cared for three presidents as West Wing physician, calling him "one of the finest people that I have met." Jackson's nomination stalled, and he withdrew when it became clear he would not be confirmed.
He announced his plan to run in the deep-red district soon after leaving the White House in December.
Sources familiar with Jackson's thinking at the time told the New York Times that the doctor hoped his ties to Trump would push him ahead of his competition, a field of 15 devoutly conservative primary candidates. Jackson is working hard to translate his image as a Trump loyalist, and one who memorably praised the president's "incredible genes," to votes.
Stacked against his competitors at the forum, Jackson made the case that only he "can walk in the Oval Office unannounced and say, ‘Sir, I need you to stop what you’re doing and listen to me,’ and he will stop what he’s doing and listen to me."
While the president has been silent on Jackson's campaign, his son Eric Trump shared a message of support and is said to have encouraged his entrance into the race. A last-chance play from Trump allies has helped raise his profile somewhat.
Jackson also said the plans he laid out for Trump during an hourlong press conference while he was still at the White House did not come to fruition. His goals included the president dropping 10 to 15 pounds and a stationary bike or elliptical being added to the White House residence.
"The exercise stuff never took off as much as I wanted it to," he said, hinting at the weight Trump has gained. "But, we were working on his diet. We were making the ice cream less accessible. We were putting cauliflower into the mashed potatoes."

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION GIVES A LITTLE IN ACKNOWLEDGING CLIMATE CHANGE: The Trump administration relented and allowed a nod to the economic risks from climate change at the conclusion of a meeting of the world’s top economic leaders this weekend.
But the reference in the statement from G-20 finance ministers was more like a passing glance, and lacking the urgency expressed by investors and economists in recent weeks.
The official “communique” said the G-20’s Financial Stability Board “is examining the financial stability implications of climate change,” reading more like a statement of fact than a reciting of priorities.
Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, told the New York Times that he and other Europeans pressed U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for a more assertive statement.
“I think that we have a totally different perspective on the risk of climate change — for us, this is clearly one of the major risks. This is a financial risk,” he said.
Mnuchin, however, downplayed the mention of climate change and took exception to perceptions that the U.S. backed down.
“I did not bend to pressure from the Europeans,” Mnuchin said. “Some of the people felt it was relevant to put in.”
A shift in thinking and action is happening regardless: Investors are increasingly finding it relevant to plan for the risks of climate change, even without the prodding of governments.
Economists from JP Morgan Chase, the world’s largest financier of fossil fuels, warned in a recent note to clients that climate change could produce “catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened.”
Last month, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, pledged to make climate change central to its investment strategy and to pressure other companies to reduce their carbon footprints in what activists hoped would be a watershed moment for the financial industry.
And in the latest example, British company Anglo Pacific Group, which provides financing to mining companies, announced Monday it will no longer invest in thermal coal — the type used in electricity.
Instead, the company is shifting its investment to a more “sustainable” portfolio that includes mining for battery materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel.

WHOSE CRIME IS IT ANYWAY?: Oil and gas companies are fighting back at Democratic presidential candidates vowing to criminally prosecute fossil fuel executives for downplaying the impact of their products on climate change.
The Western Energy Alliance bought a full-page ad published in today’s New York Times claiming it would be “criminal” to not be able to produce oil and gas. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Joe Biden have pledged to prosecute oil and gas executives. Sanders and Warren want to ban fracking for oil and gas.
“It would be criminal not to produce the reliable, affordable energy that keeps people warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and gets them to school to learn and work to provide for their families,” the ad says.
Fifty-four executives of oil and gas companies that operate in the Western U.S. signed the ad, which was timed for Super Tuesday voting.
TRUMP HAS FEW ALTERNATIVES ON YUCCA: President Trump bailing on Nevada’s Yucca Mountain has exposed the reality that the U.S. does not have viable alternatives to handle the nation’s nuclear waste.
"It's clear we don't have a way forward for a repository of nuclear waste at the moment," Rodney Ewing, a professor of nuclear security and geological sciences at Stanford University, told Josh.
Trump flips, skimps on details: The Trump administration plans to form an interagency working group to determine next steps after refusing to provide funding for Yucca in its latest budget request, flipping on its past support for the project in an election year.
In the few details described in the budget, the White House indicated that Trump supports the implementation of an interim storage program and research on "alternative technologies" to handle nuclear waste.
Alternatives are theoretical: Interim storage is not currently authorized under federal law. Despite two private companies proposing to build sites, legislation to allow it has stalled in Congress.
The Trump administration has also shown support for another alternative, known as reprocessing, that involves separating plutonium and uranium from spent fuel to make new fuel that can be used again.
But nuclear experts say reprocessing faces economic and nonproliferation concerns and does not prevent the production of nuclear waste.
"There are no alternatives to geological disposal of high-level nuclear waste," said Allison Macfarlane, a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who is now a professor at George Washington University. "No matter what you do to it, you still need a geological repository.”
Read more of Josh’s story in this week’s Washington Examiner magazine.
THREE’S A TREND: Climate change ranked second among Democratic primary voters top concerns for the third time in a row, according to polls from the Nevada caucus over the weekend.
Just over a quarter (26%) of Nevada Democratic caucusgoers said climate was their priority issue this cycle. Only healthcare ranked higher, at 43%, according to a report from CNBC.
Sanders won big: Overall and among climate voters. Sanders won the backing of 28% of caucusgoers who said climate change was their most important issue, according to the New York Times. Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg came in second among climate voters at 16%.
That result is flipped from the New Hampshire primaries, when Buttigieg won the backing of the most climate voters.
LARGEST EPA UNION CHAPTER BACKS BERNIE: It’s the first time this cycle a federal workers’ union has endorsed the Vermont senator.
The union chapter, the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, represents nearly 1,000 Environmental Protection Agency employees in the Midwest, based out of EPA’s Region 5 headquartered in Chicago.
“In endorsing Sanders today, we hope to inspire other federal unions to speak out for the good of our nation,” chapter’s president Nicole Cantello said in a statement. Cantello and other union representatives have been vocal in their opposition to Trump administration policies, including its repeated proposals to slash the EPA’s budget and its rollbacks of environmental regulations.
CLEAN ENERGY MANDATE FARES BEST AMONG VOTERS: More than half (51%) of those polled by Data for Progress backed a 100% clean energy standard, the most popular of all the climate policies tested by the group. Such a standard would require the U.S. power sector to produce electricity from all zero-carbon sources by a certain date.
The clean energy standard did even better than the progressive wing’s sweeping proposal for overhauling the economy to reduce emissions, the Green New Deal, which 45% of those polled said they supported, 35% opposed, and 20% were unsure what to think, according to results released Monday by the progressive group.
Market-based climate policies found even less support: A result representatives from the progressive group were quick to point to.
A carbon tax, for example, was split 38% in favor and 38% opposed, with a quarter unsure. A cap-and-trade system saw slightly more support (46%) than the Green New Deal, with 30% opposed.
One environmental policy saw nearly two-thirds support: Sixty one percent of those polled said they’d support Congress updating and strengthening the Clean Water Act.
TRUMP PUSHES US LNG ON INDIA TRIP: The Trump administration is looking to increase U.S. natural gas exports to India as part of the president’s trip to the country this week.
Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette joined Trump’s delegation in India, tweeting Monday that the U.S. “looks forward to increasing LNG exports to India as they work to expand their natural gas consumption.”
The administration is hoping to help finalize a proposed agreement by U.S. LNG exporter Tellurian and India’s Petronet LNG to send gas from a planned export facility on the Gulf Coast, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Despite the push from Trump, U.S. companies have struggled to find foreign buyers willing to sign long-term contracts to buy LNG, the Wall Street Journal reports, as prospective customers turn to more flexible spot markets as a cheaper alternative.
NATIONAL SECURITY RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS INEVITABLE: Even in low-warming climate change scenarios, every region of the world will face severe risks to national and global security in the next three decades, according to a report Monday from military and intelligence experts.
The report by the Center for Climate and Security warns that the world warming 1 to 2 degrees celsius over pre-industrial levels — within the goals of the Paris agreement — by 2050 would still pose “high” to “very high” security threats.
If the world warmed more than that, it would present a “very high’ to “catastrophic” threat to global and national security.
Both warming scenarios would cause social and political instability, harm to U.S. military missions and infrastructure, as well as to security institutions.
Mitigating these risks, the report advises, would require phasing out global greenhouse gas emissions — achieving net-zero emissions “as soon as possible” — as well as investing in adaptation, disaster response, and peacebuilding.
HOW BIDEN’S HOUSING PLAN WOULD CUT GREENHOUSE GASES: The former vice president is targeting buildings’ carbon emissions and urban sprawl as part of a new housing policy plan released Monday.
Under Biden’s plan, $10 billion of a proposed $100 billion Affordable Housing Fund would be earmarked for retrofitting homes to be more energy-efficient. That will also help support the goal set in Biden’s climate plan of slashing the carbon footprint of U.S. buildings in half by 2035, according to a fact sheet.
In addition, Biden’s housing plan would encourage public transportation, setting a goal of providing “quality public transportation” to all U.S. cities with more than 100,000 people by 2030. The plan also would set up a competitive grant program to lead cities to rethink regional transportation.
Biden would increase highway funding by 10%, with the new funding going to states “that embrace smart climate design and pollution reduction,” according to the fact sheet.
PIPELINE’S FATE RESTS WITH SUPREME COURT: Atlantic Coast Pipeline developers are hoping the high court will side with them and greenlight the pipeline’s construction.
That would require the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling saying the National Park Service must make the final call and grant right of way for the pipeline, which would cut under a portion of the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. The U.S. Forest Service approved a right of way for the pipeline, but a federal appeals court threw out that permit in late 2018, saying the agency couldn’t allow a pipeline on National Park Service lands.
The Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments in the case Monday.
Why does it matter which agency oversees the pipeline’s permits? If the Supreme Court agrees with the lower court and says the National Park Service should be in charge, developers would have to get congressional approval to build the pipeline in parks territory, in addition to the typical permits.
To date, work on the pipeline has already been delayed by more than a year. Bloomberg Environment has an in-depth rundown of the case here.

Texto completo: The Justice Department Inspector watchdog referred FBI agent Stephen Somma for disciplinary review after an investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses.
Somma, a counterintelligence investigator in the FBI's New York field office, was identified only as "Case Agent 1" in Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report, released in December. Sources told the New York Times that Somma is that official. The FBI did not comment for the report.
Somma was “primarily responsible for some of the most significant errors and omissions" during the process of obtaining FISA warrants to wiretap Trump campaign adviser Carter Page in 2016 and 2017, according to Horowitz. Horowitz confirmed the FBI relied heavily upon British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s salacious and unverified dossier when pursuing the secret surveillance.
The DOJ watchdog found 17 “significant inaccuracies and omissions” in the FBI's applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap Page, who was under suspicion of being an agent for Russia. He was never charged with any wrongdoing.
Horowitz wrote that Somma and an unnamed Staff Operations Specialist “were the original Crossfire Hurricane team members who had primary responsibility over the Carter Page investigation.” FBI documents showed that in late August 2016, Somma was told he had “not yet presented enough information to support a FISA application targeting Carter Page.” Somma told Horowitz’s investigators “that the team's receipt of the reporting from Steele [in September] supplied missing information in terms of what Page may have been doing during his July 2016 visit to Moscow and provided enough information on Page's recent activities that [Somma] thought would satisfy the Office of Intelligence.”
“Case Agent 1 said he prepared the FISA request form,” Horowitz wrote. “The FISA request form drew almost entirely from Steele's reporting in describing the factual basis to establish probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power.
“We found no information indicating that the FBI provided the Office of Intelligence with the documents containing Page's denials before finalizing the first FISA application,” Horowitz wrote. “Instead, Case Agent 1 provided a summary that did not contain those denials to the OI Attorney and that the OI Attorney relied upon that summary in drafting the first application.”
The inspector general did not find that Somma or his immediate supervisors were politically biased. Horowitz also did not find evidence showing the “pattern of errors” were intentional, but he noted: “we also did not find his explanations for so many significant and repeated failures to be satisfactory."
Horowitz said he did not have enough information to determine “whether it was sheer gross incompetence that led to this versus intentional misconduct or anything in between.”
When questioned by a lawyer from DOJ’s Office of Intelligence about Page’s prior relationship with the CIA, Somma claimed those “interactions took place while Page was in Moscow (which was between 2004 and 2007)” and were “outside scope.” Because of this, the attorney “did not include information about Page's prior interactions” with the CIA in the FISA application. Horowitz said the information Somma provided was “incomplete, inaccurate, and in certain respects contrary to the information the other agency provided to the Crossfire Hurricane team on August 17, 2016 and that Carter Page had provided to the FBI in 2009 and 2013.” Page’s relationship with the CIA “actually overlapped with information alleged in the FISA application concerning his alleged ties to Russian intelligence officers.”
Horowitz showed that Somma omitted significant information provided by confidential human source Stefan Halper — known as “Source 2” in the report. Halper met with and recorded Page in October 2016, before the FBI filed its first FISA application. Horowitz concluded Somma failed to include key “exculpatory” information from that meeting, including Page denying meeting with Russians mentioned in Steele’s report, denying knowledge of the WikiLeaks dissemination of the DNC emails hacked by the Russians, and denying any role in the GOP platform related to Russia.
Halper, 75, a Virginia resident and Cambridge professor, worked as an FBI informant in 2016 and had discussions with at least three Trump campaign members: Page, foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos, and Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis.
Cambridge Intelligence Seminars, which involved gatherings of academics and intelligence officials, were put together by Halper and Sir Richard Dearlove, a former director of MI6 who spent decades with the British spy agency. Somma spoke at at least one of these seminars in November 2011, delivering a talk titled “The FBI and Russian illegals 2010” along with FBI agents George Ennis Jr. and Alan Kohler Jr.

When Halper’s role as an FBI informant was leaked to the media in May 2018, it led to accusations from Trump and Republicans in Congress that the Obama administration used Halper as part of an illegal effort to spy on the Trump campaign, dubbed “Spygate” by allies of the president.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to the Defense Department's Office of Net Assessment in January asking whether any of the funds from Pentagon contracts awarded to Halper were used for the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation.

Kathleen Kavalec, then the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, met with Steele on Oct. 11, 2016, 10 days prior to the first FISA application, and Kavalec forwarded her notes to the FBI. During the meeting, Steele admitted he was encouraged by his client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a political motivation. Kavalec’s notes also show she found flaws with Steele’s allegations and cast doubt on his credibility.

Horowitz said an FBI liaison informed Somma in late November “that Kavalec had met with Steele, she had taken notes of their meeting, the liaison could obtain information from Kavalec about the meeting, and, according to Kavalec, the information from Steele's reporting about a Russian consulate being located in Miami was inaccurate.” But the FBI liaison “told us that he received no directives from the Crossfire Hurricane team to gather information from Kavalec regarding her contact with Steele.”
Earlier this month, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that current FBI employees involved in some of the events described in the FISA report "were referred to our Office of Professional Responsibility, which is our disciplinary arm."
The FBI, Congress, and the FISA court itself have also been considering and implementing reforms following the inspector general's investigation.
Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who altered a key document in FISA filings related to is the only person publicly known to be under criminal investigation by U.S. Attorney John Durham, who is conducting a review of the Russia investigation.

For Bernie Sanders, Nicaraguan human rights came second to Sandinista power

Texto completo: His attitudes toward Cuba are generating Monday's headlines, but Bernie Sanders's record on another communist authoritarian state, Nicaragua, might be even more problematic for the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner.
Where Sanders supported the Castro regime with words, he spent the 1980s providing active logistical and moral support to the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. Sanders and his supporters present this effort as simply humanitarian in nature — as support to an impoverished nation rising from the ashes of an authoritarian dictatorship.
But that's not the true story.
Consider what happened in 1986, for example, when Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, orchestrated a 500-ton aid delivery to the Sandinistas and established a sister-town relationship with the Caribbean coastal city of Puerto Cabezas.
It was a notable choice for Sanders's favor, in that Puerto Cabezas was then a stronghold for the Sandinistas' war on the native Miskito native peoples living nearby. That Sandinista campaign was a vintage communist authoritarian war for domination of land and eradication of individual freedoms. It was both merciless and deliberate. Defending the regime's atrocities, one Sandinista officer based in Puerto Cabezas told the New York Times, "They are enemies of the people."
Words straight from the lips of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. Words which evidently didn't concern Sanders. As Philip Wegmann reports, Sanders's association with this ethnic cleansing is unlikely to go away.
It is worth noting the Nicaraguan counterpoint here. After all, the Reagan administration's support for the Contras was an equal moral outrage to Sanders's support for the Sandinistas. The Contras showed a terrible disdain for human rights. But the moral difference, as applied to Sanders, is that the Sandinistas were allies of America's preeminent Soviet adversary. Moreover, it is Sanders, not Reagan, who is presently running to become president of the United States.
The Democratic front-runner remained an ardent Sandinista supporter throughout the 1980s — even as the regime used a six-year state of emergency to restrict the free press, apply KGB tactics against political prisoners, and dominate civil society under the hammer of its communist rule.
So, why didn't Sanders alter his attitudes in the face of these injustices?
The only answer is ideology. Sanders has always been a true believer in the global socialist cause. Whether enacted via authoritarianism or democratic means, Sanders hasn't really seemed to mind. When the gaze of public attention hasn't shined so tightly on Sanders as it does now, the senator has been happy not simply to defend regimes such as that of Venezuela, but to offer them as examples for America to emulate.
Nor has Sanders shown many qualms about the ideological reeducation required to make young people think that socialism is utopia, even when it brings child starvation to nations blessed with the largest oil reserves on Earth.
Interviewed in July 1986, Sanders explained why educating American children about the Sandinistas' glory wasn't enough. They had to know why communist glory is particularly glorious. "When you go into the schools, that is where you start," he said. "It's important for young people to understand the history of Nicaragua and what's going on there. But do you know what is even more important? For them to understand that they're supposed to understand, that is what is important for them to understand. That is the first thing."
As Mao Zedong observed, "Our educational policy must enable everyone who receives an education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become a worker with both socialist consciousness and culture."

Texto completo: Look, I know the primaries aren’t over, and it’s still possible that Democratic centrists will get their act together. But Bernie Sanders is now the clear favorite for the Democratic nomination. There are many things to say about that, but the most important is that he is NOT a left-leaning version of President Donald Trump. Even if you disagree with his ideas, he’s not a wannabe authoritarian ruler.
America under a Sanders presidency would still be America, both because Sanders is an infinitely better human being than Trump and because the Democratic Party wouldn’t enable abuse of power the way Republicans have.
And if you’re worried about his economic agenda, what’s your concern, exactly? That he’ll raise taxes on the rich part way back to what they were under Dwight Eisenhower? That he’ll run budget deficits? Trump is doing that already — and the economic effects have been positive.
I’m more concerned about (a) the electability of someone who says he’s a socialist even though he isn’t and (b) if he does win, whether he’ll squander political capital on unwinnable fights like abolishing private health insurance. But if he’s the nominee, it’s the job of Dems to make him electable if at all possible.
To be honest, a Sanders administration would probably leave center-left policy wonks like me out in the cold, at least initially. And if a President Sanders or his advisers say things I think are foolish, I won’t pretend otherwise in an attempt to ingratiate myself. (Sorry, I’m still not a convert to Modern Monetary Theory.) But this is no time for self-indulgence and ego trips. Freedom is on the line.

Texto completo: Penn Hills native James Zanella said he's not overly concerned -- yet -- about living roughly 40 miles away from the epicenter of Italy's coronavirus outbreak.
What worries him most is that Italian police have locked down 10 towns in the Lombardy region, which borders the Trentino region. Zanella lives in Trentino's capital of Trento.
"No one can exit or enter the towns," he said. "They even said quietly you can be arrested and put in jail if you try to leave. That's the most worrisome aspect for me right now. Here, thankfully, in Trentino it's been rather calm."
Zanella, 41, a graduate of Penn Hills High School and the University of Pittsburgh, has been living in Italy for more than a decade and teaches European history at a high school in Trento. He moved to Italy, where he has family, to finish his master's degree and found work teaching while attending the University of Trento. He now has dual citizenship in Italy and the United States.
At least six people have died from the virus in Italy, where the number of confirmed cases has reached 219, The New York Times reported. Coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has infected more than 79,000 people across the globe and killed more than 2,400, mainly Chinese.
Local relief agencies have sent medical supplies to China, and Pittsburgh-based PPG on Monday announced it will donate 1 million yuan (the equivalent of $143,400) for relief efforts. PPG also committed to matching donations from its employees. The company has nearly 4,000 employees working at 16 manufacturing sites, eight offices and four technical centers in China.
Zanella said the virus seemed to spread to Italy overnight. On Friday, he said, he learned of the first confirmed case in the Lombardy region. By Sunday, he learned the number of confirmed cases had soared to 150.
The Italian government has shut down the Venice Carnival, a festival held each year in the days leading to Lent, and similar celebrations held in smaller towns. Officials canceled soccer matches and closed schools. Schools in Zanella's area are closed at least until Monday. Austrian officials refused to let a train from Italy cross its border.
Ken Walters, spokesman for Duquesne University, said no one has been diagnosed with the virus at the school's Rome campus so far, but the university is taking precautions. They include restricting travel to areas where the virus has been reported, suspending trips scheduled for those areas and following advisories on how best to prevent exposure.
"The information has been been snowballing over the last few days," Zanella said, adding that he's trying to remain indoors as much as possible.
"I'm isolating myself," he said. "Right now, I'm at home. I'm not going out. I went to my girlfriend's over the weekend, and she wanted to go to the movies. I said, let's not go. I'm trying to avoid crowds. I've been washing my hands a lot and trying to avoid contact with people as best I can."
He said he's unsure what he might do if the virus spreads into his region.
His parents still live in Penn Hills, and he has other family in the Pittsburgh region, but he said he has no plans of returning to the United States. He noted that the flu kills hundreds of people annually in Italy, and the coronavirus death rate in Italy has so far been low.
"They're shutting everything down," he said. "That's what's worrisome, also. All of us will be quarantined. My family comes from a small village here in the mountains. I thought about maybe going up into the mountains and staying with my relatives to be around less people."

Doug Hauschild has written hundreds of press releases over the years about Dayton Flyers athletes being inducted into halls of fame or winning other awards.
On Monday, UD released a press release about Hauschild, who will be inducted into the College Sports Information Director (CoSIDA) Hall of Fame in June. He has handled UD men’s basketball and football media relations since 1981, the year he graduated from UD.
Every time this year, for example, Dayton coach Anthony Grant or star forward Obi Toppin do a postgame interview or appear at a press conference, Hauschild is the one making that happen. This season, he has been busier than ever. The No. 4 Flyers have attracted attention from all over the country. The New York Times had a reporter at Saturday’s game.
"Doug is a true professional and embodies the values of the University of Dayton,” UD Athletic Director Neil Sullivan said in a press release. “He has dedicated his entire career nominating our coaches and student-athletes for awards, and promoting them and our programs to world. It's only fitting that he is now a Hall of Famer himself and recognized by his colleagues for his achievements in the profession."
Hauschild will be one of six honorees inducted at the CoSIDA Hall of Fame luncheon on June 8 in Las Vegas.
In addition to his duties with the football and men’s basketball teams, Hauschild has served as the media coordinator at the First Four for years. In all, he has worked 102 NCAA men’s and women’s tournament games at UD Arena since 1982. That included a NCAA-record 10 postseason games (NCAA and NIT) in an eight-day period in 2001.

Brooks: Why Sanders will probably win the nomination

Texto completo: Successful presidential candidates are mythmakers. They don’t just tell a story. They tell a story that helps people make meaning out of the current moment; that divides people into heroes and villains; that names a central challenge and explains why they are the perfect person to meet it.
In 2016 Donald Trump told a successful myth: The coastal elites are greedy, stupid people who have mismanaged the country, undermined our values and changed the face of our society. This was not an original myth; it’s been around since at least the populist revolts of the 1890s. But it’s a powerful us vs. them worldview, which resonates with a lot of people.
Trump’s followers don’t merely believe that myth. They inhabit it. It shapes how they see the world, how they put people into this category or that category. Trump can get his facts wrong as long as he gets his myth right. He can commit a million scandals, but his followers don’t see them as long as they stay embedded within that myth.
Bernie Sanders is also telling a successful myth: The corporate and Wall Street elites are rapacious monsters who hoard the nation’s wealth and oppress working families. This is not an original myth, either. It’s been around since the class-conflict agitators of 1848. It is also a very compelling us vs. them worldview that resonates with a lot of people.
When you’re inside the Sanders myth, you see the world through the Bernie lens.
For example, if you look at Mike Bloomberg through a certain lens you see a successful entrepreneur who took his management skills into public service and then started giving his wealth away to reduce gun violence and climate change. If, on the other hand, you look at Bloomberg through the Bernie lens you see a rapacious billionaire who amassed a gross amount of wealth, who became an authoritarian mayor and targeted young black men and then tried to buy his way to power.
Same person through different lenses.
My takeaway from Wednesday’s hellaciously entertaining Democratic debate is that Sanders is the only candidate telling a successful myth. Bloomberg, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar all make good arguments, but they haven’t organized their worldview into a simple compelling myth. You may look at them, but you don’t see the world through their eyes.
Elizabeth Warren inhabits a myth without expressing it clearly. It just happens to be Sanders’ myth. I thought her performance Wednesday evening was tactically brilliant and strategically catastrophic. Her attack on Bloomberg was totally through the Bernie lens. Her attacks on Buttigieg and Klobuchar were also through the Bernie lens. (Through that lens a bigger spending proposal is always better than a less big spending proposal.)
Warren was a devastatingly effective surrogate for Sanders, but she reinforced his worldview rather than establishing one of her own.
Over the past five years Sanders and his fellow progressives have induced large parts of the Democratic Party to see through the Bernie lens. You can tell because every candidate on that stage has the categories and mental equipment to carve up a billionaire like Bloomberg. None have the categories or mental equipment to take down a socialist like Sanders.
Sanders goes untouched in these debates because the other candidates don’t have a mythic platform from which to launch an attack. Saying his plans cost too much is a pathetic response to a successful myth.
I’ve spent much of this election season away from the campaign rallies and interviewing voters embedded in their normal lives. This past week, for example, I was in Compton and Watts. The reality I encounter every day has little to do with the us vs. them stories Trump and Sanders are telling.
Everywhere I go I see systems that are struggling — school systems, housing systems, family structures, neighborhoods trying to bridge diversity. These problems aren’t caused by some group of intentionally evil people. They exist because living through a time of economic, technological, demographic and cultural transition is hard. Creating social trust across diversity is hard.
Everywhere I go I see a process that is the opposite of group vs. group war. It is gathering. It is people becoming extra active on the local level to repair the systems in their lives. I see a great yearning for solidarity, an eagerness to come together and make practical change.
These gathering efforts are hampered by rippers at the national level who stoke rage and fear and tell friend/enemy stories. These efforts are hampered by men like Sanders and Trump who have never worked within a party or subordinated themselves to a team — men who are one-trick ponies. All they do is stand on a podium and bellow.
In the gathering myth, the heroes have traits Trump and Sanders lack: open-mindedness, flexibility, listening skills, team-building skills and basic human warmth. In this saga, leaders are measured by their ability to expand relationships, not wall them off.
The gathering myth is an alternative myth — one that has the advantage of being true.

Texto completo: Barbara 'B.' Smith
NEW YORK - Barbara "B." Smith, one of the nation's top black models who went on to open restaurants, launch a successful home products line and write cookbooks, has died at her Long Island home at age 70 after battling early onset Alzheimer's disease.
Smith's family announced on social media that she died Saturday evening.
"Heaven is shining even brighter now that it is graced with B.'s dazzling and unforgettable smile," Smith's husband Dan Gasby said on Facebook.
Smith's eponymous Manhattan restaurant opened in 1986 and attracted a following among affluent black New Yorkers, The New York Times recalled. Essence magazine described it as the place "where the who's who of black Manhattan meet, greet and eat regularly."
Smith wrote three cookbooks, founded three successful restaurants and launched a nationally syndicated television show and a magazine. Her successful home products line was the first from a black woman to be sold at a nationwide retailer when it debuted in 2001 at Bed Bath & Beyond.
In 1976, she became the second black model to be on the cover of Mademoiselle magazine, after Joli Jones in 1969.
"You epitomized class, true beauty and dignity. Rest well Queen," actress Viola Davis wrote on Twitter.
Smith was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease in 2013. She and Gasby raised awareness of the disease, and its impacts on the African-American community, after her diagnosis.
Some described Smith as a "black Martha Stewart," a comparison she said she didn't mind though she believed the two lifestyle mavens were quite different.
"Martha Stewart has presented herself doing the things domestics and African Americans have done for years," she said in a 1997 interview with New York magazine. "We were always expected to redo the chairs and use everything in the garden. This is the legacy that I was left. Martha just got there first."
In the same interview, Gasby said, "Martha is perfection and Barbara is passion."
Smith began suffering from memory problems years before her diagnosis. She once froze for several seconds while being interviewed on the "Today Show," prompting a doctor's visit that led to her diagnosis. A few months later, she was missing in New York City for a day.
In 2018, Gasby revealed that he was in a relationship with another woman while caring for his ailing wife, leading to harsh criticism from some of her fans. He fired back at critics with a Facebook post about the pain of living with Alzheimer's in the family. "I love my wife but I can't let her take away my life," he wrote.
The couple co-authored a book, "Before I Forget: Love, Hope, Help, and Acceptance in Our fight Against Alzheimer's," and have partnered with the Brain Health Registry.
Smith, a native of Pennsylvania, began her career as a fashion model in Pittsburgh and went on to serve as a spokeswoman for Verizon, Colgate, Palmolive Oxy and McCormick's Lawry seasonings. She hosted the nationally syndicated television show "B. Smith with Style" for nearly a decade, which aired on NBC stations.
Smith is survived by Gasby, whom she married in 1992, and her stepdaughter Dana Gasby.

Shining light on bank in a new book

Texto completo: The juiciest parts of the new book Dark Towers:Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump, and an Epic Trail of Destruction pick up where the last scandal involving the bank left off - manipulating interest rates amid the 2008 financial crisis. This isn't just an expos of a massive global bank. It's also the tragic story of a senior Deutsche executive, Bill Broeksmit, who served as the conscience of the bank over many years. In January 2014, he died by suicide.
In the aftermath, the author worked with Broeksmit's son, Val, to understand why his father did what he did. Val discovered that his father's personal email accounts were chock full of official Deutsche Bank documents.
What's left to be said about a bank that has admitted to enabling the Nazi regime, and also participated in the Libor interest rate scandal? Plenty.
In 2014, Deutsche Bank senior executive Broeksmit was found dead in his London apartment. Broeksmit had helped build the 150-year-old financial institution into a colossus, and his sudden death was a mystery compounded by the bank's efforts to squelch any investigation.
In Dark Towers, published on Feb. 18 and recently excerpted in the New York Times Magazine, author David Enrich reveals Deutsche Bank's epic rise from a provincial German bank to a global superpower, and its fall into financial ruin and scandal.
Initially, the book traces the bank's history financing the construction of Auschwitz, and wooing Eastern Bloc dictators during Soviet times. He then writes about how in the 1990s, under a succession of hard-charging executives, Deutsche made a fateful decision to leave behind its conservative German roots and pursue Wall Street profits. In short order, Deutsche's leaders took the bank public, manipulated markets, violated international sanctions to aid terrorist regimes, scammed investors, evaded regulators, and laundered money for Russian oligarchs.
Keen for an American foothold, Deutsche also started doing business with a self-promoting real estate magnate nearly every other bank deemed too risky to finance: Donald Trump.
Over the next two decades, Deutsche loaned billions of dollars to Trump, the Kushner family, and an array of scandal-tarred clients, including convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. If you're looking for a jaw-dropping financial thriller, look no further than Dark Towers, particularly as Trump fights subpoenas on Deutsche Bank releasing his taxes and other financial records.
Vo-tech and veterans
Hat tip to Broad & Liberty for a heads-up that the City of Philadelphia is considering changing which types of job candidates get preferential treatment.
City Council has a measure up for vote on Thursday that would extend preferential treatment to graduates of Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs in the School District taking competitive civil service exams for city jobs.
Currently, there is a preferential "points" system extended only to veterans and the children and grandchildren of first responders killed in the line of duty. Introduced by freshman at-large Councilmember Katherine Gilmore Richardson, the bill proposes amending the Home Rule Charter and triggering a ballot question.
Last week, a number of veterans spoke out in City Council against the bill, and Richardson said her office is trying to make sure everybody's interests are protected.
"We are still working with stakeholders to hammer out the best way forward for this legislation, in terms of classifications and points awarded," she said in an email Friday. "I truly believe it will benefit hardworking Philadelphia students without being a detriment to others who currently receive other preferences. Legislation rarely passes in the exact form it started in and I am continuing to work with my colleagues and external stakeholder groups to ensure we get this right."
Richardson's bill is being criticized as diluting employment preference to veterans, who represent around 4% of Philly's workers and just 1.8% of city workers, according to Councilmember David Oh, who opposes the proposed change.
"Philly would be among the first cities to erode the veterans preference," Oh said. He argues for a hiring tax credit over awarding more "points" to vocational-technical high school graduates on par with veterans.
"The veterans preference is for brothers and sisters in arms," he said. "CTE graduates get hired quickly and are well paid. There are no lack of opportunities for these grads."
The final vote and testimony from students and veterans, open to the public, is scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday in Room 400 of City Hall.

This time, the jury believed the women

Texto completo: For the women who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, the moment was stunning.
"This is a huge day. I'm crying right now because I expected the worst," said Zoë Brock, an actor who feared Weinstein might not only be acquitted but also make a comeback in Hollywood. "But now Harvey Weinstein is a convicted rapist and right now he's sitting in Rikers jail and I am so happy about it."
True, he was not convicted of the most serious charges of predatory sexual assault, which could have sent him to jail for life. But the once-mighty Hollywood producer is facing 5 to 25 years in prison, convicted of third-degree rape of one woman and criminal sexual assault of another.
The jury believed the women — despite a lack of testimony from police and despite withering cross-examination by Weinstein's lead lawyer, Donna Rotunno, who cast his accusers as opportunistic players in a Hollywood drama where everybody understood the dirty rules.
“The arguments that Harvey's lawyer made didn't land well for the jury. They were antiquated arguments that involved a lot of victim-blaming and tried to portray Harvey as the victim of these wily women," said Debra Katz, a lawyer who represented one of the women who testified. "He was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood who was very skilled at being a predator and choosing his victims, and the jury was just no longer going to give him a pass by saying this is transactional or this is the casting couch culture."
To those who weren't closely following the trial in New York, Weinstein's conviction may have seemed like a foregone conclusion. He was, after all, the one whose behavior launched the #MeToo movement in October 2017, after the New York Times revealed endemic claims of sexual misconduct against him. In all, 109 women publicly accused Weinstein of allegations ranging from sexual propositions and forced massages to rape.
But the criminal trial relied on the claims of just six women and only those allegations that were recent and sturdy enough to be brought into criminal court in New York.
And it followed a familiar timeworn course for sexual offenses: Blaming and shaming the victims.
Take what the defense did to the actor Annabella Sciorra, whose testimony did not produce convictions. Since her alleged rape occurred too long ago to meet the statute of limitations, she testified to bolster two charges of predatory sexual assault, which requires proof of a pattern of two or more assaults. Sciorra said Weinstein shoved his way into her Manhattan apartment, forced her onto her bed and raped her, while she punched and kicked him, the Times reported.
Still, Sciorra faced scrutiny about the choices she had made. Why had she opened her door to Weinstein in the first place? Why didn't she escape him? Had she tried to scratch him or to poke him in the eyes? Did she complain to the doorman who had let him into her building?
Rotunno even suggested that with her story, Sciorra was seeking a measure of fame she no longer enjoyed as an actor.
"Now she is the darling of a movement," Rotunno said.
As noted in The Atlantic, the defense even shamed Sciorra's friends. One was asked what she did to help after learning Sciorra had started cutting herself in the aftermath of the assault. Didn't she call a doctor? When actor Rosie Perez testified that Sciorra had confided in her about the alleged rape, she was asked whether she went to see her right away.
"They were the ones that were on trial," said actor Louise Godbold who was among the so-called “Silence Breakers" who reported Weinstein, and who spoke to the media about the verdict on a conference call Monday. "They were the ones whose phones were seized, whose every last photograph and e-mail was scrutinized, their medical records, scrutinized. Harvey didn't have to go through that. How is that fair? We have to look at the way that we press charges, the way that we conduct these trials, to find a way that is less traumatizing so that more sexual assault survivors will have the courage to come forward."
To Weinstein's defense team, it was as if the past two years and 20 weeks had never happened. Weinstein's lawyers tried to shred the credibility of Weinstein's accusers, not just by casting doubt on their allegations but by portraying them as the manipulators and using their interactions with Weinstein against them.
Jessica Mann, the actor Weinstein was convicted of raping, had to admit she maintained ties and even had consensual sex with Weinstein later. She also acknowledged she had been sexually abused before she met Weinstein, prompting her to break down in court, according to the Times. Even after she left the courtroom, she could be heard screaming from a back room. Mimi Haleyi, the former movie production assistant Weinstein was convicted of sexually assaulting, had to testify that Weinstein forced oral sex on her, though she had her period. And she, too, acknowledged that she later had consensual sex with Weinstein.
Despite the women's complicated testimony, the jury believed them.
"This was such a narrow legal hallway to walk down, and many of us really braced ourselves for a not-guilty verdict," said journalist Lauren Sivan, who was among those who accused Weinstein of misconduct. "It really shows that victim-shaming will not work anymore as a defense. There's no such thing as a perfect victim. Rape is rape no matter the victim's behavior, what they wore, what they did."
Rotunno had already revealed her philosophy on The New York Times's podcast The Daily, when reporter Megan Twohey asked whether she herself had ever been sexually assaulted.
“I have not," Rotunno said. "Because I would never put myself in that position." She was trying to fault the women who had gone to Weinstein's hotel room. But outside of court, it was a stunningly tone-deaf utterance that merited its own hashtag — #WhereIPutMyself — that survivors of sexual violence began posting on Twitter, along with details of where they'd been raped.
"In a sleeping bag, trying to go to sleep in my cabin at summer camp," one wrote.
"I was walking across the street to get a sandwich," wrote another.
That was what the #MeToo movement should have taught us: That this happens everywhere. That women shouldn't be treated as prey in their workplace, that they are fending off lesser Weinsteins not only on casting couches but in insurance offices and in diners and in factories around the world.
The jury seemed to take that lesson.

Campaign-Finance Laws Created Candidate Bloomberg; They don't level the field; they tilt it to the advantage of billionaires, especially if they own media firms.

Texto completo: House Democrats held a panicked hearing this month about how to respond to the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which upheld the right of corporations to spend in elections. Their concern was the undue influence corporate spending might have on the coming elections.
In the entire 2016 campaign cycle, corporations spent less than $300 million on federal races, less than 5% of total spending. Meanwhile, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has already spent more than $360 million on cable, broadcast and radio advertisements since declaring his candidacy in mid-November. That doesn't include Mr. Bloomberg's spending on staff, office space, logistics and internet advertising. Overturning Citizens United wouldn't touch that money.
"It's a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate," tweeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The Washington Post's Greg Sargent typifies liberal angst with the claim that Mr. Bloomberg's spending "threatens to constitute a moral and political disaster."
Whether Mr. Bloomberg's ad barrage translates to more than a brief blip in the polls remains to be seen—he was savaged by his rivals in his first debate.
But Mr. Bloomberg's ad campaign is likely to help the eventual Democratic nominee, whether it is Mr. Bloomberg or someone else. Many of his ads directly attack President Trump. Since Mr. Bloomberg is a candidate, federal law mandates that he get the lowest unit ad rate. If Mr. Bloomberg used the same money to fund a super PAC, it would have to pay market rates. Thus being a candidate wins Mr. Bloomberg an advantage in softening up Mr. Trump for the Democratic nominee. At the same time, super PACs backing other candidates have to pay far more for their ads than Mr. Bloomberg does, while their campaigns are subject to strict limits on the size of contributions they can receive. The former mayor doesn't need contributions.
But all this misses an even bigger elephant in the room: Bloomberg Media, which Mr. Bloomberg owns. Federal law exempts the institutional press from campaign finance restrictions, allowing media corporations to coordinate their spending with campaigns—which is illegal for other corporations—and to avoid burdensome reporting requirements, all the while spending what they want to elect their favored candidates. Favorable media coverage—or hostile coverage of an opponent—is invaluable.
A media corporation owned or controlled by a candidate is excluded from the exemption unless its coverage is part of "a general pattern of campaign-related news" that gives "reasonably equal coverage to all opposing candidates." But unless and until they are formally nominated, Mr. Bloomberg and President Trump are not, under the law, considered "opposing candidates." The law holds that until then, Mr. Bloomberg is competing only with other Democrats for the nomination. So for now, Bloomberg News is free to trash the president and his policies all it wants.
Thus, attacking the president and sparing his Democratic rivals is the official policy of Bloomberg News and its 2,700 reporters. Bloomberg's editor in chief has written, "We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike . . . and we will extend the same policy to his [Democratic] rivals." But it "will continue to investigate the Trump administration."
Even if Mr. Bloomberg becomes the Democratic nominee, there is no way to prevent Bloomberg News from shaping its coverage of the economy and current events to help its owner's candidacy or harm the president's. For example, despite the strong economy, on a recent weekend Bloomberg News headlines included: "In Hot U.S. Jobs Market, Half of College Grads Are Missing Out," "All the Ways Stock Market Bulls Have Gone Off the Rails. Again," and "China Trade War Walloped More Than Half of U.S. States in 2019."

Wage growth has been strong, and those with lower incomes have seen the largest percentage increases. But this decline in income inequality is no reason to celebrate at Bloomberg News, which frets, "In recent years, while high-school graduates have seen a sharp pickup in earnings, the lower-earning half of college graduates haven't—and the gap between them is now the smallest in 15 years."
Bloomberg News also runs regular over-the-top opinion pieces criticizing Mr. Trump, with headlines such as: "An Unrestrained Trump May End Up Trapping Himself," "Trump Is Already Making Stuff Up About Voter Fraud," and "Trump's Tariffs Haven't Rescued American Steel." Again, all from a single weekend.
The value of these stories to Democrats in general, and to Mr. Bloomberg in particular, almost certainly exceeds Mr. Bloomberg's advertising expenditures. But there is no way that the government could or should police Bloomberg News's content for political bias.
Further, Bloomberg News's headlines and stories are not substantially different from those one finds in the Washington Post (owned by the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos), the New York Times (which is controlled by the Sulzberger family and for several years counted Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim as its largest shareholder), or most other traditional news outlets. Meanwhile, candidates operate under strict limits on contributions, making it difficult to counteract the influence of magnates with newspapers.
The whole saga illustrates the impossibility of putting government in control of campaign speech, and the unfairness that results from trying. Campaign finance laws don't equalize political influence—they give an advantage to some of the richest and most powerful men in America.
Congressional Democrats have busied themselves with proposing constitutional amendments to overturn Citizens United. That's small beer. If Democrats want to make campaigns "equal," they'll have to repeal the First Amendment's guarantee of press freedom. I doubt they want to go that far.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Billionaire Mike Bloomberg tore into Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday for his record on gun control, accusing him of being "beholden to the gun lobby. "
"The NRA paved the road to Washington for Bernie Sanders," Bloomberg tweeted. "He spent the next three decades making sure they got a return on their investment. We deserve a president who is not beholden to the gun lobby. "
The tweet included a 90-second video that says the gun rights lobby helped Sanders win a seat in Congress in 1990 because his Republican opponent, former Rep. Peter Smith, backed an assault weapons ban. The ad points to Sanders' votes against the Brady Bill, which established background checks and waiting periods for handgun purchases, and other votes against gun control measures.
Sanders' adviser Jeff Weaver contested the ad's assertions and said the NRA never endorsed Sanders.
"In fact, he lost his 1988 congressional race because he backed an assault weapons ban," Weaver told Politico. "But even after that, Sanders maintained his opposition to these weapons of war. "
Sanders and Smith both backed assault weapons bans, but Wayne LaPierre, then the executive director of the NRA, sent a letter to Vermont members urging them to cast a "protest vote" for Sanders in the 1990 election.
"Bernie Sanders is a more honorable choice for Vermont sportsmen than Peter Smith," LaPierre wrote.
Smith accused the NRA of "trying to steal this election from Vermonters with about $25,000. I think that is disgusting. "
In another tweet, Bloomberg wrote, "We already have a president who caves to the NRA. We don't need another one. "
Bernie Sanders: A look at the senator from Vermont's gun control record
Bloomberg touted his own record on gun control in contrast to Sanders'.
"In 2005, I signed a local law allowing New Yorkers to sue gun manufacturers for criminal negligence. That same year, Bernie voted to give gun manufacturers IMMUNITY – overriding my efforts to make NYers safer. Care to explain, Bernie?" he tweeted.
"I’ve been the NRA’s #1 enemy for decades. Bernie’s been the NRA’s buddy for decades. Who do we want to represent the Democratic Party?" Bloomberg said in another tweet, along with a 60-second video of clips of him calling for gun control measures.
Gun control has been a signature issue for Bloomberg. He helped start Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which became Everytown for Gun Safety in 2013. A spokesman told The New York Times Bloomberg, whose personal worth is about $60 billion, has spent $270 million backing those movements since 2007.
GOP Sen. Tim Scott: Bernie Sanders poses greatest threat to Trump's reelection – aside from Trump himself
Sanders has long backed an assault weapons ban, but on background checks, he argued the decision should be left to the states. He has defended his opposition to federal restrictions, such as the Brady Bill, on the grounds that his votes reflected the views of his constituents in Vermont, a rural state with many hunting enthusiasts.
Sanders said his views on the issue have evolved, and his platform calls for a range of strict gun control measures, including background checks on all gun purchases, banning high-capacity magazines and banning all assault weapons.
The self-described democratic socialist has taken the delegate lead in the Democratic primary race and surged to the top of most national polls. Tuesday, Sanders won a resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses with 47% of the vote.
Bernie Sanders: Nevada win forces Democrats to reckon with potential impact of his nomination
Bloomberg jumped into the race in November. His late entry was spurred by his concern that the leading Democrats, including Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, would not be able to defeat President Donald Trump in the general election.
In his first Democratic debate last week in Las Vegas, Bloomberg accused Sanders of wanting to throw out capitalism in favor of communism and said he could not "think of a way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get reelected" than listening to Sanders' critiques of the U. S. economic system.
Sanders called the reference to communism a "cheap shot" and explained he was advocating a system with greater social spending like Denmark's.
Monday, Bloomberg's campaign announced it planned to keep up the attacks on Sanders' gun control record, including a California bus tour beginning Tuesday that will highlight the issue.

Resumen: Harvey Weinstein was charged with five sex crimes, including rape and predatory sexual assault. He was found guilty on two counts.

Texto completo: A jury found Harvey Weinstein, 67, guilty of two sex crimes following a weeks-long trial in New York City Monday. The verdict is a partial victory for Weinstein, who escaped three other sex crimes charges that carried harsher sentences.
After five days of deliberation, the jury found Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree. Once a powerful figure in Hollywood, the former top producer was immediately taken into custody following the verdict. He will be sentenced on March 11.
Weinstein's conviction on the two crimes comes after pairs of exposés were published in 2017 that jump-started the #MeToo movement. Ultimately, more than 80 women accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, with many A-list stars among the accusers.
The verdict prompted stars to speak out.
Mariska Hargitay, who is best known for playing NYPD Capt. Olivia Benson on NBC's "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit," said the Weinstein verdict left her with "mixed emotions. "
"The Weinstein case represented some of the ugliest behavior I have seen in the criminal justice system. In fact, I am still reeling after some of the victim-blaming tactics used by the defense," she said in a series of tweets Monday.
Harvey Weinstein guilty: Read what Jessica Mann, Miriam Haleyi say he did in their own words
Hargitay, however, said the case also "represented some of the very best within our society. "
"Together with the many survivors who traveled to support them, #silencebreakers channeled the strength to arrive at the courtroom day after day," the actress tweeted. "They did this knowing that there were people — millions of people like you and me — standing behind them. Join me in committing to making sure that survivors know that they are not alone. That we stand with them, today and every day. "

"Sopranos" actress Annabella Sciorra, who was the first accuser to take the stand in Weinstein's trial, said in a statement Monday that her testimony was "painful but necessary. "
Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her in 1993-94, continued: "I spoke for myself and with the strength of the eighty plus victims of Harvey Weinstein in my heart. While we hope for continued righteous outcomes that bring absolute justice, we can never regret breaking the silence. For in speaking truth to power we pave the way for a more just culture, free of the scourge of violence against women. ”
Rose McGowan, one of Weinstein's first public accusers, tweeted that "today is a powerful day" and "a huge step forward in our collective healing. "
Rosanna Arquette expressed her gratitude to the women who testified against Weinstein. Arquette previously told The New Yorker she rebuffed an early 1990s advance from Weinstein, saying he asked for a massage while wearing only a bathrobe.
"Gratitude to the brave women who’ve testified and to the jury for seeing through the dirty tactics of the defense. We will change the laws in the future so that rape victims are heard and not discredited and so that it’s easier for people to report their rapes," Arquette tweeted.
Ashley Judd, who accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and filed a claim in Los Angeles, also tweeted her support to the women who testified.
"For the women who testified in this case, and walked through traumatic hell, you did a public service to girls and women everywhere, thank you. #ConvictWeinstein #Guilty," she wrote.
Rosie Perez, who testified about Annabella Sciorra's rape allegation in the trial, tweeted her excitement for the split verdicts while noting that it was "not enough. "
"HARVEY WEINSTEIN HAS BEEN HANDCUFFED & TAKEN TO JAIL! GUTTED FOR MY DEAR FRIEND #ANNABELLASCIORRA WHO TOLD THE TRUTH! YET I CONGRATULATE HER & ALL WHO CAME FORWARD FOR THEIR BRAVERY. THIS IS NOT ENOUGH BUT SURVIVORS TAKE COURAGE! THIS IS STILL A GREAT WIN! CONGRATS JOAN ILLUZZI!" she wrote.
Asia Argento, an early accuser of Weinstein, shared a selfie of her and fellow accuser Samantha Panagrosso to Instagram and praised the verdict.
"Harvey Weinstein is now a convicted rapist. Two survivors cry and and celebrate. Thank you God. Thank you to all the brave women. Thank you to the judge and jury in NYC — @samyliscious — this one goes out to you Anthony," Argento captioned the post, referencing her late boyfriend Anthony Bourdain.
Judd Apatow reminded people that Weinstein's legal troubles are still not over as he awaits charges in Los Angeles.
"Don’t forget- Harvey Weinstein faces four more charges in Los Angeles. This is just the beginning of holding him accountable," Apatow tweeted.
Reese Witherspoon called the Weinstein verdict a "victory. "
"Today’s historic win in the Weinstein trial is a testament to the bravery and resilience of the #SilenceBreakers, and a victory for survivors everywhere. This is just the beginning," she wrote.

Mira Sorvino wrote that this is "the beginning of #justice. More to come, my sisters. "
Alyssa Milano tweeted out details of the verdict.
"The jury convicted Weinstein of 1 count of rape & 1 count of committing a criminal sexual act. He was acquitted on the charges of predatory sexual assault, which each carried a potential life sentence," she wrote.
Elizabeth Banks was pleased to see Weinstein brought to justice.
"I am heartened for his victims and for all those who said #metoo and #TimesUp that some justice has been done," she tweeted
"Top Chef" host Padma Lakshmi chimed in as well.
"Harvey Weinstein is now a convicted rapist. If there's a man who doesn't deserve bail, it's him," Lakshmi wrote. "Here's hoping for consecutive sentences. "
"Ocean's 13" actress Ellen Barkin tweeted out the names of the women who testified against Weinstein and thanked them.
"Thank you all for your tremendous courage and strength. You have changed the future for all of us," she wrote.
"Difficult People" star Julie Klausner instructed people to spread the news of Weinstein's guilty verdict to a random woman on the street and watch their reaction.
"Go up to a female stranger right now and tell her Weinstein guilty and watch her face, I just did it & it was amazing," Klausner wrote.
Ronan Farrow, whose investigation into Weinstein's sexual abuse for The New Yorker earned him a Pulitzer Prize, put the spotlight on the women who came forward.
"Today’s outcome in Harvey Weinstein’s New York trial is the result of the decisions of multiple women to come forward to journalists and to prosecutors at great personal cost and risk. Please keep those women in your thoughts today," Farrow tweeted.
Speaking on behalf of the Hollywood Commission, Dr. Anita Hill called the verdict a "clarion call of justice. "
Hill, who testified before Congress in 1991 that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her, said the verdict is "a strong statement to our industry that when we honor the voices of survivors, progress is possible. "
Actress and model Dominique Huett, who has filed a civil lawsuit against Weinstein, said she hopes he spends time in prison thinking "about how his abuse of power sexually harmed countless women with dreams of making it Hollywood. "
Huett added: "The verdict cannot change what Weinstein did, but I hope that people have a better understanding about why victim-shaming must end and why women that dare speak out deserve support. "
Russell Simmons accuser Drew Dixon tweeted out her reaction after hearing the verdict.
"Rape is rape," Dixon wrote before adding the #MeToo hashtag.
Mindy Robinson of "Millionaire Matchmaker," said she sees Hollywood embracing Weinstein after a couple of years.
"Harvey Weinstein was just found guilty of rape. I bet in 5 years Hollywood elites will go right back to applauding him at the Academy Awards," Robinson tweeted, comparing Weinstein to director Roman Polanski, who has pleaded guilty to a sex offense with a minor and has denied accusations of rape by multiple women.
Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar called the verdict "a victory for the brave survivors who spoke out against Weinstein.
"Our system so often silences survivors and delivers injustice, so we can’t let up in our fight to lift up survivors and hold predators who abuse their power fully accountable," she tweeted.
Tina Tchen, president and CEO of the Time's Up Foundation, which was founded in response to the #MeToo movement, issued a statement writing the verdict "marks a new era of justice. "
"We owe a debt of gratitude to Mimi Haleyi, Jessica Mann, Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff, Lauren Young, and all the Silence Breakers for their bravery and resolve as they faced this man in court," the statement read. "The jury’s verdict sends a powerful message to the world of just how much progress has been made since the Weinstein Silence Breakers ignited an unstoppable movement.
It continued: "While we celebrate this historic moment, our fight to fix the broken system that has allowed serial abusers like Harvey Weinstein to abuse women in the first place continues. Abusers everywhere and the powerful forces that protect them should be on notice: There’s no going back. "
Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the two New York Times journalists who helped break open the Weinstein story, tweeted the verdict along with a quote from the disgraced movie mogul.
"I'm Harvey Weinstein -- you know what I can do,'" Kantor wrote shortly after news of the verdict broke. "Weinstein, whose signature throughout forty years of allegations was lack of accountability, has been declared guilty on two counts. "
Ana Navarro-Cárdenas, a political commentator for CNN and ABC News, tweeted her support and thanked those who spoke out against Weinstein.
"Grateful to all the courageous victims -and the villages that supported them- for stepping up and sharing your painful experiences so #Weinstein would be held accountable," she wrote. "You have inspired and made a difference in the lives of many. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. "
Kevin Spacey's accuser, Anthony Rapp, also tweeted out his gratitude to the women who spoke out.
"I applaud the women who bravely stepped forward to help forever alter the conversation around what they — and all of us — have to put up with. Gratified to see some justice being served here," Rapp wrote and added the #MeToo hashtag.
Gretchen Carlson, named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2017, also shared her thoughts.
Kenyan poet, Shailja Patel wrote that Weinstein's guilty verdict can't erase the harm imposed on his victims.
"No guilty verdict or jail sentence, even for life, can restore what Harvey Weinstein stole from his victims. Or repair the harm he inflicted in his decades-long reign of terror over an entire industry. But this is a tiny crack in the wall of impunity. Let patriarchy tremble.
Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.
Besides the two accusers whose allegations were central to the case, Weinstein's trial also featured testimony from four other accusers who testified that Weinstein sexually assaulted them in New York or California as far back as 1993 and as recently as 2013.

Texto completo: Back during the scandal over his sexual exploitation of a young intern, Bill Clinton was pilloried in this space for his moral defects.
To which many liberals responded with derision. Morality? What did that matter? The economy was good, we were at peace and Clinton was hardly the first man to fool around and lie about it. As one reader put it, he was hired to be a president, not a pope.
At the time, that felt like a rationalization. A generation later, it feels like a portent. Indeed, it is often said that we are living now in Post-Fact America but truth is, we are also living in Post-Integrity America.
No, that's not breaking news. But it's been brought into painfully clear focus these last few days.
One watched - not with surprise anymore, the capacity for that being long lost, but surely with dread and fascination - as Donald Trump launched his post-impeachment purge of aides deemed insufficiently sycophantic. But that was just a prelude.
Last week, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 people, most of them guilty of lying, fraud, corruption, tax evasion and similar crimes. In other words, the kinds of things of which Trump has often been accused.
The power to soften or wipe away criminal convictions is one of the nicer perks of the presidency, allowing compassion to be shown to those who deserve it. And in fairness, several of those who benefited last week seem to meet that standard. Crystal Munoz, for instance, had been sentenced to almost 20 years for dealing pot.
But it is worth noting that every person Trump pardoned or gave clemency came to his attention not through the normal machinery of government, but through inside connections or else, as the New York Times noted, "were promoted on Fox News." Some were championed by aides and allies. Some had donated big money to his campaign. And again, most had breached the public trust.
Like former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who had served eight years of a 14-year sentence for trying to sell Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat. Trump, who has opined how unfair it is that U.S. companies are not allowed to pay bribes to do business overseas, had called that sentence "ridiculous."
It's no great leap to suggest that he sees himself in Blagojevich. Or in former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and financier Michael Milken, whom he pardoned for tax fraud and securities fraud, respectively. If granting clemency and pardons opens a window upon a president's moral priorities - and it does - the view offered here suggests an unfortunate affinity for scammers and grifters, an empathy for those on the make, cutting deals, cutting corners, living the dream, until they got caught up by pesky rules designed to enforce integrity. And if those same people happened to give him money or had their names whispered into his ear by a friend, so much the better.
That's not how this is supposed to work. And that it is working this way right out in the open, before our very eyes, suggests - no, screams - Trump's imperviousness to any sense of ethical affront.
During Clinton's scandal, it was argued in this space that a president stamps himself upon an era "not simply by legislative accomplishment, but also  by dint of personal authority and moral suasion."
Trump disproves that. He has stamped himself upon this era while ignoring the very idea of personal authority or moral suasion - and daring us to care. But we had better. By his lack of personal character, Trump threatens our national character. And he stamps this era with the signature lesson of his life:
Once you give up integrity, it's easy to give up everything else.

Step up to stop deed theft

Texto completo: B roadies Byas was once the owner of a beautiful Bed-Stuy brownstone valued at $1.2 million. The home was a point of pride: Her father, the child of former slaves, bought it in 1957 for just $7,500, securing him the dream of homeownership. Years later, however, that dream became a nightmare, when criminals tricked Byas into turning over the home for just one-tenth of its value. Five years later, she is still struggling to restore the title to her family home. As Byas told the New York Times, "I pride myself as a true New Yorker - angry, skeptical, not trusting, but I felt like the stupidest person on the planet."
Byas' ordeal is an example of what is known as deed theft - when criminals swindle vulnerable homeowners into turning over the title of their homes. Deed theft comes in many forms, from pressuring homeowners facing foreclosure to sign loan documents to forging signatures of deceased homeowners before title has passed on.
In low-income communities with increasing property values, criminals use deed theft to target seniors, people who are sick, or those in financial distress. Byas became a target when she fell behind on her mortgage payments. According to city records, there have been 4,000 complaints of deed theft since 2014, almost half of which were in Brooklyn.
One of the few lines of defense standing between scammers and homeowners is the Homeowner Protection Program (HOPP). HOPP is a state program administered by the attorney general for homeowners like Byas. It funds nearly 100 nonprofit organizations across the state that provide no cost legal and counseling services to homeowners. The program also helps victims of scams get their home back and reports offenders to enforcement agencies.
A dozen strong consumer protection laws, put in place following the foreclosure crisis, require pre-foreclosure notices to be provided to homeowners at risk of foreclosure, a mandatory settlement conference process for foreclosure cases once they get to court, protections for reverse mortgage borrowers, and strong mortgage servicing regulations.
But however strong the laws are on the books, they are worthless if consumers can't turn to advocates who can help them enforce their rights against predatory practices, which is exactly what HOPP does.
The record shows that HOPP is not just good policy but a good deal for New York. In 2019, the estimated savings to New York State generated under HOPP was about $1.2 billion, while the cost of HOPP to the state is approximately $20 million - an almost 60 times return on investment.
Even if HOPP only prevents 3% of homeowners from becoming homeless, it would pay for itself. In places like New York City, where almost a quarter of foreclosures are located, mortgage payments are often less than rent. On Long Island, where another quarter of the foreclosures are, rental housing of any kind is scarce.
Last year, it cost as much as $47,000 per year to provide emergency shelter to a single adult and $81,000 to a family. At these costs, keeping just 312 families and individuals housed by protecting them from scammers would be more than the annual cost of HOPP, which serves approximately 15,000 families per year.
Deed theft scams, which heavily target gentrifying New York City boroughs but exist elsewhere, cost homeowners hundreds of thousands of dollars in equity. This equity should be going towards generational wealth-building.
HOPP depends on the state renewing its funding every year in the budget. In other words, unless the Legislature and governor direct funds to HOPP in this year's budget, the program will end. HOPP is one of the best tools we have to preserve affordable homeownership, enforce strong laws on the books, and build generational equity for homeowners. Our communities cannot afford to lose it.

Texto completo: There was no news from the Louis C. K. comedy show at the Orpheum Theater in downtown Phoenix on Friday night.
Yes, he addressed it. He talked about the New York Times story that made him a social and cultural pariah when it was published in November 2017. He did so by mocking himself. He did so without blame. He did so without apology.
It was a small portion of his act. It was mentioned at the beginning and he would return to it briefly again while on stage.
But his set wasn’t dominated by it.
For the most part, the stand-up comedian did what was expected: He performed 80-some minutes of abrasive, edgy, hilarious and smart comedy before a sold-out appreciative audience.
Louis C. K. had two more shows in the historic theater scheduled for Saturday and Sunday nights.
The comedy touched third rails — the Holocaust, pedophilia, necrophilia, terrorist acts, to name a few — that shocked the audience but never felt cheap. The laughs were deep and earned.
It was the type of well-constructed material that might not have seemed such a surprise in previous years. Such as in his “Oh My God” special, filmed at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix, in which he offered his audience a rationalization for slavery and urged everyone, even those in good marriages, to get divorced.

But since Louis C. K. announced that the stories women told the New York Times were true, that he did occasionally ask women — friends, fellow comedians, potential mentees — if he could masturbate in front of them, it was seemingly all that came to mind when anyone thought about him.
But apparently, he had other thoughts on his mind over the past two years. Enough for more than hour’s worth of the kind of well-honed material that had made him such a comedic legend.
That legend fell apart in the wake of the Times story. A movie he made was shelved. The network on which his critically-acclaimed television series aired canceled its deal with him. He stopped performing.
By 2018, he was making unscheduled drop-ins at New York comedy clubs. Then scheduled performances. He announced his tour in late 2019. It started in Monterrey, Mexico, then moved to Houston and Denver before arriving in Phoenix.
There were no protesters outside the theater. Just a line of patrons waiting to surrender their cell phones in a locked pouch for the duration of the show.

The jokes Louis C. K. told about his scandal won’t be repeated here. And not just because attendees, as part of the fine print on the ticket, agreed not to share his material in any way, shape or form or risk legal consequences.
The jokes won’t be repeated here because this isn’t the proper forum they are meant to be consumed in. They are meant to be heard, not read. And only heard when delivered by the man himself.
Had Louis C. K. made news with his jokes, that rule wouldn’t apply. The urgency to share the news of what the comedian said on a stage in Phoenix on Friday night would have won out.
But there was no news.
When Louis C. K. took the stage, in his trademark outfit of a black T-shirt and jeans, most in attendance stood and applauded.
When he finished, with a bit whose subject was so dark it would not be repeated here even if Louis C. K. expressly allowed it, the crowd gave him another standing ovation.
Not for taking the stage. But for returning to form.

Texto completo: COLOGNE, Germany - The last time Henriette Reker ran for mayor, she was nearly killed.
Reker was handing out flowers to voters at a bustling market in Cologne, Germany, in 2015 when a man took a rose with one hand and rammed a kitchen knife into her throat with the other. He wanted to punish her for her pro-refugee stance.
Five years later, Reker is running again. But she is an exception. Since she recovered from a coma to find herself elected, far-right death threats have become an everyday reality, not just for her but for an increasing number of local officials across Germany.
The acrimony is felt in town halls and village streets, where mayors find themselves the targets of threats and intimidation. The effect has been chilling.
Some have stopped speaking out. Many have quit, tried to arm themselves or taken on police protection. The risks have mounted to such an extent that some German towns are unable to field candidates for leadership at all.
"Our democracy is under attack at the grassroots level," Reker said in a recent interview in Cologne's City Hall. "This is the foundation of our democracy, and it is vulnerable."
The trend, local officials and analysts said, reflects a worrying breakdown of civility and political discourse in a polarized Germany, where the insidious influence of an angry far right is changing the rules of behavior.
Mayors have not been the only ones to suffer as Germany's political and social fabric has strained. The shootings last week in the western town of Hanau, near Frankfurt, that left 11 people dead were just the latest attacks aimed at ethnic minorities.
Germans who openly support immigration have been targeted, too. Given the decentralized nature of Germany's political system, local officials like mayors may be the most important among them. Attacks against them take on outsize significance.
Over the last year, there were 1,240 politically motivated attacks on politicians and elected officials in Germany, according to preliminary figures released this year by federal police.
A study conducted by the German Association for Cities and Municipalities showed that 40% of the country's city governments had to contend with stalking, harassment or threats. Of the 11,000 mayors in the country, at least 1,500 reported concrete threats.
And people have died. In June, Walter Lübcke, a regional official, was killed on his front porch by a known extremist, the first far-right assassination of a German politician since World War II.
Supporters of far-right ideology were responsible for more than one-third of the reported episodes, nearly twice as many as were committed by supporters of the extreme left, the government said.
But nearly half of all politically motivated attacks could not be attributed to any specific group, reflecting what experts said showed the erosion of civil norms.
Experts and local officials who have been affected said the violence started when the 2008 economic crisis began to bite. But it took on new dimensions in 2015 after Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the borders to more than 1 million asylum-seekers, most of them Muslim and many fleeing wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Andreas Zick, director of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence at the University of Bielefeld, has been tracking the mood of German society for decades.
He said he first noticed groups of people calling themselves "concerned citizens" who were critical of politicians emerge more than a decade ago.
One of their concerns has now grown into a concerted campaign of hate against local politicians and representatives, he said, driven by populist forces such as the far-right Alternative for Germany, a party known by its German initials, AfD.
"The populists have declared the 'elites' as their enemy, and now we are seeing the rise of this politics of hate which has infected the center of society," Zick said.
Barbara Lücke, the mayor of Pulsnitz in the eastern German state of Saxony, has been targeted by hate campaigns.
"The arrival of the refugees was a catalyst," she said, "but it would have happened regardless."
She attributed the rise in violence to a toxic cocktail of an "anything goes" culture on social media, a dearth of social services and a lack of understanding among Germans in the former Communist East about how a representative democracy works.
"We as a society have lost the ability to respect one another, or those in government," said Lücke, an independent.
"There are no boundaries anymore and no understanding for how to respond when my idea of freedom is in conflict with someone else's idea of freedom," she said. "We have forgotten how to resolve conflicts."
By some accounts, the atmosphere has become particularly toxic in eastern Germany, where the AfD wins on average 1 in 4 votes and many more in rural areas.
Burkhard Jung, the mayor of Leipzig, another eastern city, said that in his first nine years as mayor, he did not get a single threat. But that changed when the country took in the refugees.
"Something broke open then - something came out," he said. "These threats would come. We had to install a security system in our house. Police would sometimes be outside.
"How do you explain that to your children?" he added.
In the five years since she was stabbed, Reker, the mayor of Cologne, said anonymous death threats and constituents writing to say they understand those who want her murdered have poured in.
Shortly after the murder of Lübcke, Reker received a letter signed, "Sieg Heil und Heil Hitler!"
"The phase of cleansing has started," it stated. "Many more will follow him. Including you. Your life will end in 2020."
Last month, she buried a City Hall employee who had been stabbed while on the job.
But Reker has refused to change her message. Just recently she asked the Cologne City Council to approve of a plan to welcome 100 additional refugees and 16 unaccompanied child refugees who are stuck in a camp on the Greek island of Lesbos.
The motion was passed. But in response, a representative of the far-right Alternative for Germany, Sven Tritschler, immediately took to the microphone.
"You have blood on your hands," he said.

Beijing's Great Leap Backward: A fear of information

Texto completo: Several years ago, in an overheated room in Beijing, I was forced to endure a stern lecture from a Chinese foreign ministry official. My sin: As the editor at The Wall Street Journal responsible for the paper's overseas opinion sections, I had apparently insulted the entire Chinese people by publishing the work of a "well-known terrorist" -- courageous Uighur human rights activist Rebiya Kadeer.
I had to clench my jaw to suppress the rejoinder that China's best-known tyrant, Mao Zedong, has his portrait overlooking the killing field known as Tiananmen Square.
I thought of that episode last week on hearing news that the Chinese government decided to expel three Wall Street Journal reporters based in China -- two Americans and an Australian -- in retaliation for the headline of an opinion column by Walter Russell Mead, "China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia." In a style reminiscent of my own experience, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement claiming, "The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and smear China with malicious attacks."
Any reader of Mead's column, headline and text alike, will note that there isn't an iota of racism in it, though it makes a devastating case about the ways in which the coronavirus epidemic has exposed the broader fragility of the Chinese system. And those familiar with The Wall Street Journal will know that the paper, like The New York Times, enforces a strict separation between its news and opinion sections -- meaning the reporters facing expulsion had absolutely nothing to do with the writing and publication of Mead's column.
But factual accuracy is irrelevant in a political scapegoating exercise, which is what this strike on the Journal is all about. And this does more to underscore Mead's broader point about China's inherent weaknesses than it does to contradict it.
What are those weaknesses? Demographers point to China's falling birthrate, aging population and gender gap. Economists cite its faltering productivity, its made-up statistics and its giant debt bomb. And political analysts point to ever more repressive policies from Beijing, leading to ever greater discontent from Hong Kong to Xinjiang.
But the coronavirus crisis has exposed a far deeper weakness: The Chinese regime fears information.
It was just this fear that, as my colleague Nick Kristof pointed out, led the government to suppress news about the new virus -- and punish whistleblowing doctors -- when it should have done the opposite, swiftly, so as to better contain its spread. The result was the loss of the critical time in fighting the virus, all but guaranteeing the global health crisis that followed.
This sort of behavior is nothing new for the Chinese government: It mishandled the 2003 SARS epidemic in much the same way. Nor is the problem specific to China: Any regime that depends on the manipulation or manufacture of "truth" for its own survival is bound to act in similar ways. That's one of the reasons Donald Trump's nonstop lying and misstatements of fact aren't just immoral but also dangerous. Truth driven underground doesn't vanish. It stalks.
But the problem for the Chinese is much more acute, for the simple reason that they don't have genuinely independent domestic journalism. That means that ordinary people have no access to timely, accurate and comprehensive information -- and neither do China's rulers. The result is rumor, which can be dangerous; ignorance, which can be fatal; and miscalculation, which can be catastrophic.
The move against The Wall Street Journal will compound the regime's problems, since reporting by foreign news organizations has often been critical in filling the omissions and straightening the distortions of China's official media. It was the Journal that did some of the most pathbreaking work to expose the scale of the country's environmental catastrophes, just as it was the Times that exposed the extent of graft at the top of the Chinese leadership pyramid. Other news outlets, particularly Reuters, have done vital reporting on the frauds and scams endemic in China's economy.
Suppress this kind of reporting, and the first people who will suffer information blindness are China's leaders. Every dictator needs subscriptions to the Journal and the Times, even if they come -- like smutty magazines of yore -- in inconspicuous brown envelopes.
It's always possible that the regime will think better of its move to expel the reporters or at least quietly let them return in a few weeks' time. Wise leaders, facing a monumental crisis brought on by their own irrational distrust of information, would at least learn the lessons of their folly. But there might be a truth in China even more frightening than the coronavirus -- foolish rulers.
For that, no vaccine has ever been invented.

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders won big on Saturday and is now the clear front-runner. Former Vice President Joe Biden saved enough face to march on to his must-win in South Carolina a week from now. Pete Buttigieg finished in the top tier again and embraced the urgency of knocking down a rising Sanders, though it is not clear where he wins next. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren is awash in cash after her debate dismantling of Michael Bloomberg -- $9 million in three days -- but the performance did not nudge her up in the standings in Nevada.
Here are takeaways from Saturday:

Sanders in command
Sanders did not just win Nevada. Entrance polls show that he dominated.
Those polls showed Sanders winning men and women; whites and Latinos; voters in all but the oldest age group (17-29, 30-44 and 45-64); those with college degrees and those without. He was carrying union households and nonunion households, self-identified liberal Democrats (by a wide margin) and moderate and conservative ones (narrowly).
The Sanders victory was built upon three distinct and yet overlapping bases of support: young people (56% support among those 44 and under), very liberal voters (49%) and a majority of Latino voters. The latter was a new factor in Nevada after two heavily white opening states, Iowa and New Hampshire, and particularly important as the race expands to big and diverse states on Super Tuesday with large Latino populations, none more significant than California and Texas.
Sanders has now won the most votes in each of the first three states. (Buttigieg appears to have edged him in delegates in the still-disputed Iowa results) and has more momentum than all his rivals and more money than everyone besides the two self-funding billionaires, Tom Steyer and Bloomberg.
It was no accident that Sanders spent much of the day before the Nevada caucuses in California and had two rallies in Texas on Saturday: The campaign is looking ahead to Super Tuesday, March 3, as the day he breaks away from the rest of the Democratic field.

The field isn't shrinking
Not long after the first results began rolling in, a super PAC supporting Buttigieg announced it was buying TV ads in Super Tuesday states. Biden's campaign manager declared that "the Biden comeback" had just begun. Sen. Amy Klobuchar dropped from her New Hampshire showing yet claimed to have "exceeded expectations." And Warren's campaign manager said her performance at last week's debate would prove more important than the actual election.
Translation: No one is about to quit this race.

Biden's best finish is second
The Biden case for the nomination has been straightforward: He's the guy to beat President Donald Trump. Yet for the third time in three races, Biden did not win. He did improve from his bad fourth-place finish in Iowa and his disastrous fifth place in New Hampshire (as of late Saturday both Buttigieg and Biden were claiming second as Nevada sloooowly processed results).
But throughout February, Biden had said that his fortunes would be reversed now that more diverse states were voting. Except it was Sanders who soundly defeated Biden among Latino voters, according to entrance polls, while Biden's lead among African Americans -- his strongest base -- continued to shrink to 12 percentage points.
"Y'all did it for me. Y'all did it," Biden nonetheless told his supporters in Las Vegas.

Buttigieg wants to be anti-Bernie
Of all the victory and concession speeches on Saturday, Buttigieg's was the most revealing. He used the big platform not just to make the case for himself but to slash at Sanders, whom he accused of pushing an "inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans."
Going forward, the problem is that Buttigieg's early successes in Iowa, New Hampshire and, to a lesser extent, Nevada, have not yet lifted him nationally.

Warren doesn't get Nevada bump
If Wednesday's debate performance was going to turn Warren's political fortunes, it did not do so fast enough for the Nevada caucuses.
The results delivered another round of frustration for a candidate who fell below expectations in both Iowa and New Hampshire.
"We believe the Nevada debate will have more impact on the structure of the race," campaign manager Roger Lau wrote on Twitter.

Living in President Trump's post-integrity America

Texto completo: Back during the scandal over his sexual exploitation of a young intern, Bill Clinton was pilloried in this space for his moral defects.
To which many liberals responded with derision. Morality? What did that matter? The economy was good, we were at peace and Clinton was hardly the first man to fool around and lie about it. As one reader put it, he was hired to be a president, not a pope.
At the time, that felt like a rationalization. A generation later, it feels like a portent. Indeed, it is often said that we are living now in Post-Fact America. But truth is, we are also living in Post-Integrity America.
No, that's not breaking news. But it's been brought into painfully clear focus these last few days.
One watched -- not with surprise anymore, the capacity for that being long lost, but surely with dread and fascination -- as Donald Trump launched his post-impeachment purge of aides deemed insufficiently sycophantic. But that was just a prelude.
Last week, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 people, most of them guilty of lying, fraud, corruption, tax evasion and similar crimes. In other words, the kinds of things of which Trump has often been accused.
The power to soften or wipe away criminal convictions is one of the nicer perks of the presidency, allowing compassion to be shown to those who deserve it. And in fairness, several of those who benefited last week seem to meet that standard. Crystal Munoz, for instance, had been sentenced to almost 20 years for dealing pot.
But it is worth noting that every person Trump pardoned or gave clemency came to his attention not through the normal machinery of government, but through inside connections or else, as The New York Times noted, "were promoted on Fox News." Some were championed by aides and allies. Some had donated big money to his campaign. And again, most had breached the public trust.
Like former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who had served eight years of a 14-year sentence for trying to sell Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat. Trump, who has opined how unfair it is that U.S. companies are not allowed to pay bribes to do business overseas, had called that sentence "ridiculous."
It's no great leap to suggest that he sees himself in Blagojevich. Or in former New York police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and financier Michael Milken, whom he pardoned for tax fraud and securities fraud, respectively. If granting clemency and pardons opens a window upon a president's moral priorities -- and it does -- the view offered here suggests an unfortunate affinity for scammers and grifters, an empathy for those on the make, cutting deals, cutting corners, living the dream, until they got caught up by pesky rules designed to enforce integrity. And if those same people happened to give him money or had their names whispered into his ear by a friend, so much the better.
That's not how this is supposed to work. And that it is working this way right out in the open, before our very eyes, suggests -- no, screams -- Trump's imperviousness to any sense of ethical affront.
During Clinton's scandal, it was argued in this space that a president stamps himself upon an era "not simply by legislative accomplishment, but also by dint of personal authority and moral suasion."
Trump disproves that. He has stamped himself upon this era while ignoring the very idea of personal authority or moral suasion -- and daring us to care. But we had better. By his lack of personal character, Trump threatens our national character. And he stamps this era with the signature lesson of his life:
Once you give up integrity, it's easy to give up everything else.

Texto completo: It has been less than two weeks since Matthew Cherry, the Chicago native and NFL retiree turned entertainment sensation, won the Oscar for best animated short film for his charming movie "Hair Love," a story about a black father doing his young daughter's hair for the first time.
"Hair Love" was released in theaters in August with "The Angry Birds Movie 2" and came out in December on social platforms. The film has received more than 20 million views on YouTube, and has an accompanying picture book that became a New York Times bestseller.
Cherry, who directed and wrote the film, came back to Chicago Thursday for a screening of the movie and a panel discussion about black hair and black beauty. He was joined on the panel by three local women: Caroline Robinson, a cosmetic dermatologist; Ebony Jamison, a beauty, fashion and lifestyle blogger; and Amina Smith of Stadium Sports Network, who moderated the discussion.
Cherry sat down with the Tribune for five minutes to talk about his Oscar win and what's next for him. The conversation has been edited for space and clarity.
Q: Watching you and Sony executive and producer Karen Rupert Toliver -- two black people with locs -- walk up to the stage to receive the Oscar for "Hair Love" was a powerful moment. You all brought DeAndre Arnold, and you talked about the CROWN Act in your speech. It really felt like the culmination of a moment. What kind of message do you think this sent?
A: Anytime you can have art meet real-life action and change, with a story like DeAndre's and the story like the CROWN Act, it's just the best situation possible for a film. Our goal was to always try to help change the world, and try to have young black boys and girls see themselves in this medium of animation, which often is the first medium of film that most kids are introduced to. When you don't see yourselves in these mediums, it really can do a number to your self-confidence. There are so many stories of young kids saying they want their hair straight like their favorite character and just things that may not seem damaging at the time. For us, we wanted a character in Zuri (the daughter in the film) who was very proud of her hair; you can tell she got it from her mom -- and her dad, as well, who has locs and tattoos and looks like any young black man you would see today. We just wanted people to see themselves in the project.
Q: Some would say you kind of "spoke into existence" your Oscar win with some clairvoyant tweets. What was that winning moment like for you, knowing how long the journey had been of starting "Hair Love" from a Kickstarter?
A: Eight years ago, it was a little darker time in my career. I just did my first feature and was trying to figure out what would happen next. I didn't get the same love that a lot of other filmmakers get after their first films, so I was kind of considering giving it up. I didn't have a lot of followers on Twitter at the time, so I could just put stuff out there almost like a journal. So for it to happen -- when I tell you it all felt like a dream and still does -- it hasn't really, truly hit me. I had to go right back into work the very same day. I had to bring it with me (on the set of "mixed-ish"); I didn't even get a chance to go home. Light flex, light flex. It was cool though, too, because for the most part, how many times are you ever going to see an Oscar in your life? It was cool seeing the cast and crew be inspired.
Q: You dedicated your award to Kobe Bryant. What does it mean to you to have won in the same category he did just two years ago?
A: Kelly Carter, an ESPN writer, made the connection that he was the first former athlete and I was the second. Kobe actually retweeted it, it was one of his last tweets. He said, "Let's go." He was very supportive. I think it just goes to his mentality: He didn't see it as competition but as another young brother trying to come up, and he wanted to support. I hoped he may present the category. For me, he represents everybody who has a strong second act in their career; he always talked about wanting to be a storyteller. Even when he won his Oscar two years ago, backstage you could tell he was like a kid, he was just so honored to be there. Because there was that connection of both being a former athlete, I really wanted to honor him, and show him that obviously what he did blazed the path and now we just got to keep the ball going.
Q: Black men and their sons have a special bond with their hair as well, so I'm curious what made you choose to focus on a father-daughter relationship in "Hair Love"?
A: Back in 2016, I came across a really amazing image of what looked like an Afro-Brazilian father, and his daughter was sitting in his lap and she had these two afropuffs. How they also say little girls are "daddy's little girl" and little boys are "mama's little boy," there's just something about that dynamic that is always so special. I saw that image; that's when I initially had the idea for the project, and then I tried to make it happen. A year later, for whatever reason, it fell off. Then I came across all these videos of dads doing their daughters' hair. For me, it was like if we can capture that same magic that is helping these videos go viral, then we'll be in good shape. I think that's what we did.
Q: In your speech, you mentioned "Hair Love" being born out of wanting to normalize black hair. Do you have anything else in the works that will continue moving that mission forward?
A: In all my work, I always try to normalize black life. Typically it's smaller, slices-of-life stuff, stories that show us just being us and just us existing. And that act in itself is radical because so often we have the burden of our entire race when we're doing films, where we have to represent for everybody. And I think the more we just normalize each other's stories, I just think the world will be a better place.

Texto completo: Just over two years since Louis C.K. fell into disgrace, he's staging an audacious comeback tour.
The scandal began with a scathing November 2017 report in the New York Times that the comic masturbated in front of five women or while on the phone with them, or had asked to do so.
Now, Louis C.K. is selling out venues across the country, including two shows at State Theatre New Jersey in New Brunswick on March 4 and 5 and Philadelphia on March 6.
A representative for Louis C.K. declined to comment on the comedian's return to the stage.
It may be the boldest attempt at a #MeToo comeback the entertainment world has seen yet — at a time when society allows for few second chances, Louis C.K.'s loyal fans seem willing to condemn the conduct, but not the comedian.
And unlike performers who work for large corporations, he may be in a unique position to stage his own revival.
"What separates Louis C.K. from some of these other offenders is that when you work alone, you can go anywhere and your fans can have anonymity," said Danny Deraney, a Los Angeles-based public relations executive recognized as a top celebrity crisis communications expert.
"You can just appear as someone and get paid and there are no contracts. It's not the same impact as 20 people saying, 'I'm not going to work with this person anymore.' "
Still, there was fallout for the popular comedian. After he confirmed the claims in a statement to the Times, his film "I Love You, Daddy," was cancelled, as was a Netflix stand-up special and an appearance on HBO's "Night of Too Many Stars" autism special.
"What I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your (penis) isn't a question," he wrote. "It's a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly."
But Louis C.K.'s return is not without controversy — including whether venues should book him.
"I'm not shocked that people are buying tickets," said Chelsea Moroski, a 26-year-old comedian living in North Brunswick who has performed at venues throughout New Jersey.
"No matter what the industry, people who do bad things are usually not given the repercussions that they should," she said. "It's sad but it's not surprising. There is going to be an audience for everything."
But the box office bottom line doesn't lie.
Sarah Chaplin, president and CEO of State Theatre of New Jersey, said in a statement that having Louis C.K. acknowledged his failings and his performance provides a chance to continue discussing the issues.
"I do not condone Louis C.K.'s previous actions or behavior," Chaplin said in her email. "Instead of sweeping Louis C.K. and his conduct under the 'Cancel Culture' carpet, we must take the opportunity to continue the discourse and correct the environment, so this kind of behavior does not occur."
Longtime fan Lindsey Adams of Philadelphia, who has seen Louis C.K. several times in the past, will be among those in the audience when the comedian performs at the Met.
Adams said she read The New York Times report, and Louis C.K.'s statement, but that did not weigh on her decision to purchase tickets.
"He just did something that's like very perverted and probably (messed) up and he shouldn't do it," she said. "But I think that to hold someone accountable their entire life for something that they did in their personal life, I think that that can be separated from how you see that person as an entertainer."
"People should be free to enjoy whatever they want," said Philadelphia-based comedian Jesse Draham. "I'm going to the show with my own moral hang-ups about the guy, but if you try to make every dollar you spend 100 percent morally ethical, you will have no place to spend your money."
Draham also said he was happy to see the announcement of the current tour, "because the guy is like the best comedian of a generation. There's no way around that."
And Louis C.K. appears to fall into a category of entertainers who are able to come back after a #MeToo disgrace. Unlike Harvey Weinstein, who is on trial for sex crimes, and Bill Cosby, who is in jail after being convicted of sexual assault, Louis CK's path is similar to that of "A Prairie Home Companion" host Garrison Keillor, whom Minnesota Public Radio cut ties with after he was accused of inappropriate behavior. Keillor continues to tour and will host the "A Prairie Home Companion" Caribbean Cruise in March.
Louis C.K. did suffer professional consequences. Along with the canceled release of his film "I Love You, Daddy," FX Networks cut its professional ties with him, and his character from the 2016 animated children's film "The Secret Life of Pets" was voiced by Patton Oswalt for the movie's 2019 sequel.
But he's continued to perform live stand-up. Following a number of small-scale shows, he launched this international comeback tour in late 2019.
"Louis C.K. doesn't need Netflix and NBC and CBS so he can work again," said Deraney.
"He can go into Bob's Comedy Club in Toledo, Ohio, and make a couple thousand dollars, whereas for someone like Kevin Spacey to work, he needs to have some sort of a production company," Deraney said. "He has a luxury that other people don't in that he can perform to a half house or a full house and I don't think he cares if he is going to be protested or if one person out of 50 is going to say something."
Jess Alaimo, a 32-year-old comedian living in Asbury Park, shared Moroski's belief that, in the end, money trumps outrage. She will not support the State Theatre after its choice to book Louis C.K., she said.
"It's about money, and if people are going to see him, he's going to be booked. You can't expect people wanting to make money to have good morals," said Alaimo. "It's about our culture and why this matters for women and why it's not OK. Until we address the culture, people like Louis will be booked."
Patricia Teffenhart, executive director of New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said that people shouldn't be profiting off of sexual misconduct.
"I would like to see that we wouldn't be looking to profit off other people's trauma," she said.
According to Teffenhart, the 21 county-based sexual violence service programs that the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault works with served 19,000 victims and their loved ones last year, an increase from the average 10,000 victims per year and their loved ones over the past six years.
"In this scenario with Louis C.K., the most dramatic impact we can have is to not invest our financial resources see his performance," said Teffenhart. "I certainly would never intend to invest my money to sit in an audience where we are going to hear the traumatic effects he's had on other peoples' lives."
A 'tone-deaf' show During an early 2019 comedy show in San Jose, California, Louis C.K. joked, "I like to jerk off, and I don't like being alone," according to the Daily Beast and other news sources.
Throughout the years before Louis C.K. was accused by the five women, he also joked about masturbation — at least 17 times from 2005 through 2017, according to an article by The Cut.
But Louis C.K. is now taking measures to try to keep questionable material from his shows from being recorded or shared.
Last May, a strict policy for all of his shows was announced which does not allow audience members to bring their phones or share material from his performance in any way, shape or form without his express consent.
Upon arrival to the venues, all phones and smartwatches are secured in Yondr pouches — basically a bag that seals up your phone — that are opened at the end of the shows — a practice that's become increasingly common at concerts, film festivals and other events.
In the first shows of Louis C.K.'s new tour hosted in Richmond, Virginia, on Nov. 2, the comedian stuck to subjects that fans have come to expect from him, including Sept. 11, slavery, pedophilia and the Holocaust.
According to a New York Times review of one of the Richmond shows, "Those looking for any apologetic notes or reckoning with the damage he has done will be disappointed. He is not aiming for redemption onstage. If anything, he's doubling down on the comedic value of saying the wrong thing."
Teffenhart finds Louis C.K.'s ability to joke and profit off his past behavior perhaps most alarming of all.
"What's troubling about this scenario is the doubling down on the content in his bit — there doesn't seem to be remorse," she said. "He's using the experiences that have caused trauma to others to continue to make money, and that is to me where we have to draw a distinct line. I can't speak to whether he's changed his behavior, but the tone seems to imply that there's not a lot of remorse."
Keith Corcoran of Matawan said he will be attending one of the State Theatre shows with his mother and sister as a family celebration for his sister's 45th birthday. All three, Corcoran said, are fans of Louis C.K. dating back to his 2006 HBO series, "Lucky Louie."
He had bought his sister and mother tickets to see the comedian at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan a few years ago, but Corcoran's mother suffered an injury at the train station and had to miss the show.
"Yes, it's kind of strange to be taking both my 67-year-old mother and 45-year-old sister to this," Corcoran said via email, "but my mother is a retried psychiatric ward nurse and my sister runs a nursing home so they are well versed in the horrors of life and the human condition."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – On the day President Donald Trump was acquitted of “high crimes and misdemeanors” in the Senate impeachment trial, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted more than 80 times, taunting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and calling on the party to expel Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the sole Republican who voted to convict his father.
Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law and another ubiquitous campaign surrogate, posted three tweets. She barely mentioned impeachment.
As Trump's children take on an expanded role in his reelection campaign, they embrace different styles – and speak to different constituencies. From Trump Jr. ’s bombastic rally warmups and social media posts to Lara’s focus on women's issues and Ivanka Trump’s composed policy perch inside the White House, Trump’s family tailors its message to different voters.
“What would you do if you woke up on Nov. 4 and Bernie Sanders was your president?” Trump Jr. asked as he revved up a Phoenix crowd last week before a rally. “Guess what, guys: There are no do-overs. You get one chance to get this right. ”
Trump's stories: Cop to a crying businessman, what Trump’s anecdotes reveal
Polling: Poll shows Trump defeating all 2020 Democratic candidates in Wisconsin
Trump Jr. 's bomb-throwing is especially noticeable in his social media feed. The president's eldest son is far more likely than his siblings to use Twitter to attack Democrats, according to a USA TODAY analysis of nearly 4,500 tweets from the Trump family. He has referenced Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, for instance, in 8% of the tweets to his 4. 4 million followers since Oct. 1. That's a higher share than all of his siblings combined.
He is more likely to use the word “media” on Twitter, virtually always in an attack.
Republican observers said Trump Jr. 's red-meat style has made him a rising star among conservative voters within the president’s base.
By contrast, Lara Trump – who married Eric Trump in 2014 and who has taken on an increasingly high-profile role in the president’s election – is more likely than other family members to use the word “woman” on social media, according to the analysis. That syncs with her appearances at Women for Trump events in Iowa, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. A senior adviser on the campaign, Lara has been more likely to mention the words “employment” and “job” than other surrogates.
Lara Trump's pitch to suburban women
"The media tells us women don’t support Trump! WRONG!" Lara posted Jan. 17 to her 761,000-plus followers.
The approach has allowed her to reach out to women voters, particularly suburban women. Donald Trump narrowly won white women in 2016, exit polls showed, but that support has slipped. A new USA TODAY/Ipsos poll found that 54% of suburban women are more likely to say a Democrat would be better for the country.
Ivanka Trump, who has been a more sporadic presence on the campaign trail in 2020, has focused heavily on her efforts inside the White House on workforce development, rarely wading into politics on social media. While Trump Jr. shares memes of Romney with a “Mom Jeans” caption, Ivanka Trump is more likely to post images of her official trips overseas on behalf of the administration, or of her children.
“Since 2017, rural areas have had similar or better economic performance than urban areas as measured by GDP growth, housing value appreciation and labor market participation,” Ivanka Trump tweeted this month in a message that was similar to others she has posted.
Her husband, Jared Kushner, whose vast portfolio includes building the wall along the U. S. -Mexican border and Middle East peace, has never posted a tweet. Both have long been viewed as moderating forces, relatable to centrist Republicans and some swing voters who crossed from backing President Barack Obama to Trump in 2016.
Trump campaign officials declined to discuss the strategy behind the use of family surrogates, but spokeswoman Erin Perrine described their involvement in the campaign as "key to victory in 2016" and predicted the same would hold true for 2020.
"Who better to speak to voters about President Trump and his record of success than those who know him best?" Perrine said. "Members of the Trump family are valued advisers and an integral part of this campaign. "
Lara Trump said her work on behalf of the campaign has brought the Trump family together.
"Nothing can really prepare you for this," Lara Trump told USA TODAY in an interview. "We all became a lot closer because it almost feels like you go through a war with people. And I would say for all of us – including my father-in-law – we’re all a lot closer because of it. "
Dianne Bystrom, a former director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University, said some of the president’s adult children fulfill a campaign role more typically handled by a first lady. In the 2020 cycle, Melania Trump has been less active on the campaign trail than many of her predecessors, including Michelle Obama and Laura Bush.
“It is not unusual for presidential candidates to employ surrogates, including family members, to strategically target the campaign's message with a variety of groups,” Bystrom said. “I think we see so much more of the Trump children because Melania Trump has not been an effective spousal surrogate. ”
The 'star power' of family members
Few presidential candidates have been able to draw so heavily on their progeny as proxies, and few have been able to put their children so front and center. President George H. W. Bush brought in his family, including George W. Bush, in the 1988 election. Romney’s children often appeared on stage during his 2012 campaign.
The difference in Trump’s case is that many of his children were well known before he ran for president.
“If you want star power, add the Trump name, and you automatically have it,” said Jason Miller, who was a senior aide on the president’s 2016 campaign.
“In addition to the last name, they bring a sense of passion, a sense of insight into the policies,” Miller said. “It says something when the people who know President Trump the best are willing to get out there and work so hard for him. ”
The ubiquity of Trump’s children on the trail has had another impact: It has raised speculation about their own political ambitions.
Trump Jr. , who published a New York Times bestseller last year, is among Republican voters’ top picks for the nomination in 2024, according to a poll for the news site Axios last month. Ivanka Trump also made the list, along with Vice President Mike Pence.
That interest hasn’t been lost on Trump’s children or the crowds turning out to hear the president speak.
When the president recognized Trump Jr. during a rally in New Hampshire this month, his supporters chanted, “46” – as in the 46th president.
When Trump Jr. addressed an audience in San Antonio last fall, someone in the audience shouted out “2024. ” As many in the crowd laughed, Trump Jr. held a dramatic pause before his response.
“Let’s worry about 2020 first!” he said.

"You can just appear as someone and get paid and there are no contracts. It's not the same impact as 20 people saying, 'I'm not going to work with this person anymore.' "
Still, there was fallout for the popular comedian. After he confirmed the claims in a statement to the Times, his film "I Love You, Daddy," was cancelled, as was a Netflix stand-up special and an appearance on HBO's "Night of Too Many Stars" autism special.
"What I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your (penis) isn't a question," he wrote. "It's a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly."
But Louis C.K.'s return is not without controversy — including whether venues should book him.
"I'm not shocked that people are buying tickets," said Chelsea Moroski, a 26-year-old comedian living in North Brunswick who has performed at venues throughout New Jersey.
"No matter what the industry, people who do bad things are usually not given the repercussions that they should," she said. "It's sad but it's not surprising. There is going to be an audience for everything."
But the box office bottom line doesn't lie.
Sarah Chaplin, president and CEO of State Theatre of New Jersey, said in a statement that having Louis C.K. acknowledged his failings and his performance provides a chance to continue discussing the issues.
"I do not condone Louis C.K.'s previous actions or behavior," Chaplin said in her email. "Instead of sweeping Louis C.K. and his conduct under the 'Cancel Culture' carpet, we must take the opportunity to continue the discourse and correct the environment, so this kind of behavior does not occur."
Longtime fan Lindsey Adams of Philadelphia, who has seen Louis C.K. several times in the past, will be among those in the audience when the comedian performs at the Met.
Adams said she read The New York Times report, and Louis C.K.'s statement, but that did not weigh on her decision to purchase tickets.
"He just did something that's like very perverted and probably (messed) up and he shouldn't do it," she said. "But I think that to hold someone accountable their entire life for something that they did in their personal life, I think that that can be separated from how you see that person as an entertainer."
"People should be free to enjoy whatever they want," said Philadelphia-based comedian Jesse Draham. "I'm going to the show with my own moral hang-ups about the guy, but if you try to make every dollar you spend 100 percent morally ethical, you will have no place to spend your money."
Draham also said he was happy to see the announcement of the current tour, "because the guy is like the best comedian of a generation. There's no way around that."
And Louis C.K. appears to fall into a category of entertainers who are able to come back after a #MeToo disgrace. Unlike Harvey Weinstein, who is on trial for sex crimes, and Bill Cosby, who is in jail after being convicted of sexual assault, Louis CK's path is similar to that of "A Prairie Home Companion" host Garrison Keillor, whom Minnesota Public Radio cut ties with after he was accused of inappropriate behavior. Keillor continues to tour and will host the "A Prairie Home Companion" Caribbean Cruise in March.
Louis C.K. did suffer professional consequences. Along with the canceled release of his film "I Love You, Daddy," FX Networks cut its professional ties with him, and his character from the 2016 animated children's film "The Secret Life of Pets" was voiced by Patton Oswalt for the movie's 2019 sequel.
But he's continued to perform live stand-up. Following a number of small-scale shows, he launched this international comeback tour in late 2019.
"Louis C.K. doesn't need Netflix and NBC and CBS so he can work again," said Deraney.
"He can go into Bob's Comedy Club in Toledo, Ohio, and make a couple thousand dollars, whereas for someone like Kevin Spacey to work, he needs to have some sort of a production company," Deraney said. "He has a luxury that other people don't in that he can perform to a half house or a full house and I don't think he cares if he is going to be protested or if one person out of 50 is going to say something."
Jess Alaimo, a 32-year-old comedian living in Asbury Park, shared Moroski's belief that, in the end, money trumps outrage. She will not support the State Theatre after its choice to book Louis C.K., she said.
"It's about money, and if people are going to see him, he's going to be booked. You can't expect people wanting to make money to have good morals," said Alaimo. "It's about our culture and why this matters for women and why it's not OK. Until we address the culture, people like Louis will be booked."
Patricia Teffenhart, executive director of New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said that people shouldn't be profiting off of sexual misconduct.
"I would like to see that we wouldn't be looking to profit off other people's trauma," she said.
According to Teffenhart, the 21 county-based sexual violence service programs that the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault works with served 19,000 victims and their loved ones last year, an increase from the average 10,000 victims per year and their loved ones over the past six years.
"In this scenario with Louis C.K., the most dramatic impact we can have is to not invest our financial resources see his performance," said Teffenhart. "I certainly would never intend to invest my money to sit in an audience where we are going to hear the traumatic effects he's had on other peoples' lives."
A 'tone-deaf' show During an early 2019 comedy show in San Jose, California, Louis C.K. joked, "I like to jerk off, and I don't like being alone," according to the Daily Beast and other news sources.
Throughout the years before Louis C.K. was accused by the five women, he also joked about masturbation — at least 17 times from 2005 through 2017, according to an article by The Cut.
But Louis C.K. is now taking measures to try to keep questionable material from his shows from being recorded or shared.
Last May, a strict policy for all of his shows was announced which does not allow audience members to bring their phones or share material from his performance in any way, shape or form without his express consent.
Upon arrival to the venues, all phones and smartwatches are secured in Yondr pouches — basically a bag that seals up your phone — that are opened at the end of the shows — a practice that's become increasingly common at concerts, film festivals and other events.
In the first shows of Louis C.K.'s new tour hosted in Richmond, Virginia, on Nov. 2, the comedian stuck to subjects that fans have come to expect from him, including Sept. 11, slavery, pedophilia and the Holocaust.
According to a New York Times review of one of the Richmond shows, "Those looking for any apologetic notes or reckoning with the damage he has done will be disappointed. He is not aiming for redemption onstage. If anything, he's doubling down on the comedic value of saying the wrong thing."
Teffenhart finds Louis C.K.'s ability to joke and profit off his past behavior perhaps most alarming of all.
"What's troubling about this scenario is the doubling down on the content in his bit — there doesn't seem to be remorse," she said. "He's using the experiences that have caused trauma to others to continue to make money, and that is to me where we have to draw a distinct line. I can't speak to whether he's changed his behavior, but the tone seems to imply that there's not a lot of remorse."
Keith Corcoran of Matawan said he will be attending one of the State Theatre shows with his mother and sister as a family celebration for his sister's 45th birthday. All three, Corcoran said, are fans of Louis C.K. dating back to his 2006 HBO series, "Lucky Louie."
He had bought his sister and mother tickets to see the comedian at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan a few years ago, but Corcoran's mother suffered an injury at the train station and had to miss the show.
"Yes, it's kind of strange to be taking both my 67-year-old mother and 45-year-old sister to this," Corcoran said via email, "but my mother is a retried psychiatric ward nurse and my sister runs a nursing home so they are well versed in the horrors of life and the human condition."

Texto completo: Just over two years since Louis C.K. fell into disgrace, he's staging an audacious comeback tour.
The scandal began with a scathing November 2017 report in the New York Times that the comic masturbated in front of five women or while on the phone with them, or had asked to do so.
Now, Louis C.K. is selling out venues across the country, including two shows at State Theatre New Jersey in New Brunswick on March 4 and 5 and Philadelphia on March 6.
A representative for Louis C.K. declined to comment on the comedian's return to the stage.
It may be the boldest attempt at a #MeToo comeback the entertainment world has seen yet — at a time when society allows for few second chances, Louis C.K.'s loyal fans seem willing to condemn the conduct, but not the comedian.
And unlike performers who work for large corporations, he may be in a unique position to stage his own revival.
"What separates Louis C.K. from some of these other offenders is that when you work alone, you can go anywhere and your fans can have anonymity," said Danny Deraney, a Los Angeles-based public relations executive recognized as a top celebrity crisis communications expert.
"You can just appear as someone and get paid and there are no contracts. It's not the same impact as 20 people saying, 'I'm not going to work with this person anymore.'"
Still, there was fallout for the popular comedian. After he confirmed the claims in a statement to the Times, his film "I Love You, Daddy," was cancelled, as was a Netflix stand-up special and an appearance on HBO's "Night of Too Many Stars" autism special.
"What I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your (penis) isn't a question," he wrote. "It's a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly."
But Louis C.K.'s return is not without controversy — including whether venues should book him.
"I'm not shocked that people are buying tickets," said Chelsea Moroski, a 26-year-old comedian living in North Brunswick who has performed at venues throughout New Jersey.

"But I think that to hold someone accountable their entire life for something that they did in their personal life, I think that that can be separated from how you see that person as an entertainer."
"People should be free to enjoy whatever they want," said Philadelphia-based comedian Jesse Draham. "I'm going to the show with my own moral hang-ups about the guy, but if you try to make every dollar you spend 100 percent morally ethical, you will have no place to spend your money."
Draham also said he was happy to see the announcement of the current tour, "because the guy is like the best comedian of a generation. There's no way around that."

China returns to a darker age

Texto completo: Several years ago, in an overheated room in Beijing, I was forced to endure a stern lecture from a Chinese foreign ministry official. My sin: As the editor at The Wall Street Journal responsible for the paper's overseas opinion sections, I had apparently insulted the entire Chinese people by publishing the work of a "well-known terrorist" - courageous Uighur human-rights activist Rebiya Kadeer.
I had to clench my jaw to suppress the rejoinder that China's best-known tyrant, Mao Zedong, has his portrait overlooking the killing field known as Tiananmen Square.
I thought of that episode this week on hearing Wednesday's news that the Chinese government has decided to expel three Wall Street Journal reporters based in China - two Americans and an Australian - in retaliation for the headline of an opinion column by Walter Russell Mead, "China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia." In a style reminiscent of my own experience, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement claiming, "The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and smear China with malicious attacks."
Any reader of Mead's column, headline and text alike, will note that there isn't an iota of racism in it, though it makes a devastating case about the ways in which the coronavirus epidemic has exposed the broader fragility of the Chinese system. And those familiar with The Wall Street Journal will know that the paper, like The New York Times, enforces a strict separation between its news and opinion sections. But factual accuracy is irrelevant in a political scapegoating exercise. And this does more to underscore Mead's broader point about China's inherent weaknesses than it does to contradict it.
What are those weaknesses? Demographers point to China's falling birthrate, aging population and gender gap. Economists cite its faltering productivity, its made-up statistics and its giant debt bomb. And political analysts point to ever more repressive policies from Beijing, leading to ever greater discontent from Hong Kong to Xinjiang. But the coronavirus crisis has exposed a far-deeper weakness: The Chinese regime fears information.
It was just this fear that, as my colleague Nick Kristof pointed out, led the government to suppress news about the new virus - and punish whistleblowing doctors - when it should have done the opposite, swiftly, so as to better contain its spread.
This sort of behavior is nothing new for the Chinese government: It mishandled the 2003 SARS epidemic in much the same way. Nor is the problem specific to China: Any regime that depends on the manipulation or manufacture of "truth" for its own survival is bound to act in similar ways. That's one of the reasons Donald Trump's nonstop lying and misstatements of fact aren't just immoral but also dangerous. Truth driven underground doesn't vanish. It stalks. But the problem for the Chinese is much more acute, for the simple reason that they don't have genuinely independent domestic journalism. The result is rumor, which can be dangerous; ignorance, which can be fatal; and miscalculation, which can be catastrophic.
The move against The Wall Street Journal will compound the regime's problems, since reporting by foreign news organizations has often been critical in filling the omissions and straightening the distortions of China's official media. It was The Journal that did some of the most pathbreaking work to expose the scale of the country's environmental catastrophes, just as it was The Times that exposed the extent of graft at the top of the Chinese leadership pyramid. Suppress this kind of reporting, and the first people who will suffer information blindness are China's leaders. Every
It's always possible that the regime will think better of its move to expel the reporters or at least quietly let them return in a few weeks' time. Wise leaders, facing a monumental crisis brought on by their own irrational distrust of information, would at least learn the lessons of their folly. But there might be a truth in China even more frightening than the coronavirus - foolish rulers. For that, no vaccine has ever been invented.

WikiLeaks founder heads to court today

Texto completo: LONDON – His Ecuadorian hosts claim his indoor soccer games destroyed embassy equipment. And that he liked to ride a skateboard in the halls. Nearly a year after British police officers dragged him – heavily bearded, disheveled and resisting – into a waiting van, the cramped embassy quarters where he spent seven years avoiding the long reach of the U.S. Justice Department still retain the odor of cat litter from his trusted feline companion.
A court hearing that begins here Monday could determine whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who published classified U.S. government communications as well as emails hacked by Russia from Hilary Clinton's failed 2016 presidential campaign, will continue to be confined – and if so, where and how.
The hearing will decide if Assange is sent to the U.S. to face trial in a case that could have serious implications for First Amendment protections.
Since May, the 48-year-old Australian national has been locked up at Belmarsh Prison, which houses some of Britain's most dangerous lawbreakers.
Assange is there because he was found guilty of skipping bail in 2012; he fled to Ecuador's embassy rather than turn himself in to British authorities for possible extradition to Sweden. Investigators there wanted to question him over sexual assault allegations connected to two women.
Assange hid because he feared Sweden would, in turn, extradite him to the U.S. The Department of Justice has indicted him on 18 counts, alleging 17 forms of espionage and one instance of computer misuse connected to WikiLeaks' dissemination of caches of secret U.S. military documents provided to him by former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.
Assange denies all the allegations. The Swedish case has since been dropped. In Britain, he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for jumping bail, a period he has already served.
But there's more at stake than one anti-secrecy advocate's freedom.
John Kiriakou, a former CIA analyst who blew the whistle on a U.S. government-sanctioned torture program in 2007, said that Assange's U.S. case could set a precedent that would erode press freedoms for news organizations that publish classified information.
"If you are able to prosecute someone who has a strong case to be called a publisher, then who's next?" said Kiriakou, who served jail time after pleading guilty to leaking the name of an officer involved in waterboarding.
Assange describes himself as a political refugee. He maintains that as a journalist, he should be immune from prosecution and that his work revealed embarrassing and highly damaging facts about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the detainees held at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Assange's detractors say he doesn't write stories or interview anyone or provide explanatory context, and the dissemination of raw, unfiltered documents and data – the publication of stolen classified materials – should not count as journalism.
"WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service," then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo said in April 2017. Pompeo is now U.S. secretary of State.
Justice Department officials in President Barack Obama's administration ultimately decided they could not prosecute Assange for revealing national security secrets, described as one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history, because it risked criminalizing subsequent national security journalism.
"During the Obama administration it was called 'the New York Times problem,' " after the newspaper's record of publishing information on national security matters the U.S. government has deemed secret, said Stephen Rohde, a historian and constitutional law expert. "In other words, how can we indict him for espionage when we're confident he's a journalist, a publisher and enjoys First Amendment rights."
Generally speaking, the First Amendment restrains the government from jailing, fining or imposing liability for what the press publishes. It does not shield journalists from criminal liability.
The information Assange published contained about 90,000 Afghanistan War-related "significant activity" reports, 400,000 Iraq War-related reports, 800 Guantanamo Bay "detainee assessment" briefs and 250,000 State Department cables. The material illuminated U.S. military and diplomatic procedure and actions in far-flung places, and the light it shined was not flattering.
To his supporters, Assange is a champion of free speech and the public interest.
To his critics, he is a criminal who conspired to steal thousands of pages of national defense information that has risked the lives of U.S. forces, allies and collaborators.
If Assange is sent to the U.S. to stand trial, he could get a life sentence – 175 years – if found guilty on all 18 charges.
It is far from certain that Assange will lose his extradition case. And even if he does, it does not automatically follow he will be sent to the U.S., according to Anand Doobay, an expert in the rules governing extradition at London-based firm Boutique Law.
Doobay said if the judge decides "not to refuse" the U.S. request, then Britain's secretary of state will have to decide whether to order it, a call that involves scrutiny of factors such as whether there is a risk that by extraditing him Assange could face the death penalty. British law forbids extradition under such circumstances.
While none of the current charges carries the death penalty, Assange's supporters have argued that the Trump administration can't be trusted and could unveil additional charges that do carry a death sentence once Assange arrives on U.S. soil.
Doobay noted that most extradition requests the U.S. makes to the U.K. are granted. It's not clear what will happen if Assange prevails in the British court. Because he has already served 50 weeks for skipping bail, he could simply be free to go. But if he is deported to his native Australia, the U.S. could mount a new extradition case. It could also issue an international arrest warrant if he travels beyond Britain's borders.

Texto completo: Just over two years since Louis C.K.
fell into disgrace, he's staging an audacious comeback tour.
The scandal began with a scathing November 2017 report in the New York Times that the comic masturbated in front of five women or while on the phone with them, or had asked to do so.
Now, Louis C.K. is selling out venues across the country, including two shows at State Theatre New Jersey in New Brunswick on March 4 and 5 and Philadelphia on March6.
A representative for Louis C.K. declined to comment on the comedian's return to the stage.
It may be the boldest attempt at a #MeToo comeback the entertainment world has seen yet – at a time when society allows for few second chances, Louis C.K.'s loyal fans seem willing to condemn the conduct, but not the comedian.
And unlike performers who work for large corporations, he may be in a unique position to stage his own revival.
"What separates Louis C.K. from some of these other offenders is that when you work alone, you can go anywhere and your fans can have anonymity," said Danny Deraney, a Los Angeles-based public relations executive recognized as a top celebrity crisis communications expert.
"You can just appear as someone and get paid and there are no contracts. It's not the same impact as 20 people saying, 'I'm not going to work with this person anymore.'"
Still, there was fallout for the popular comedian. After he confirmed the claims in a statement to the Times, his film "I Love You, Daddy," was cancelled, as was a Netflix stand-up special and an appearance on HBO's "Night of Too Many Stars" autism special.
"What I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your (penis) isn't a question," he wrote. "It's a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly."
But Louis C.K.'s return is not without controversy – including whether venues should book him.
"I'm not shocked that people are buying tickets," said Chelsea Moroski, a 26-year-old comedian living in North Brunswick who has performed at venues throughout New Jersey.
"No matter what the industry, people who do bad things are usually not given the repercussions that they should," she said. "It's sad but it's not surprising. There is going to be an audience for everything."
But the box office bottom line doesn't lie.
Sarah Chaplin, president and CEO of State Theatre of New Jersey, said in a statement that having Louis C.K. acknowledged his failings and his performance provides a chance to continue discussing the issues.
"I do not condone Louis C.K.'s previous actions or behavior," Chaplin said in her email. "Instead of sweeping Louis C.K. and his conduct under the 'Cancel Culture' carpet, we must take the opportunity to continue the discourse and correct the environment, so this kind of behavior does not occur."
Longtime fan Lindsey Adams of Philadelphia, who has seen Louis C.K. several times in the past, will be among those in the audience when the comedian performs at the Met.
Adams said she read The New York Times report, and Louis C.K.'s statement, but that did not weigh on her decision to purchase tickets.
"He just did something that's like very perverted and probably (messed) up and he shouldn't do it," she said. "But I think that to hold someone accountable their entire life for something that they did in their personal life, I think that that can be separated from how you see that person as an entertainer."
"People should be free to enjoy whatever they want," said Philadelphia-based comedian Jesse Draham. "I'm going to the show with my own moral hang-ups about the guy, but if you try to make every dollar you spend 100 percent morally ethical, you will have no place to spend your money."
Draham also said he was happy to see the announcement of the current tour, "because the guy is like the best comedian of a generation. There's no way around that."
And Louis C.K. appears to fall into a category of entertainers who are able to come back after a #MeToo disgrace. Unlike Harvey Weinstein, who is on trial for sex crimes, and Bill Cosby, who is in jail after being convicted of sexual assault, Louis CK's path is similar to that of "A Prairie Home Companion" host Garrison Keillor, whom Minnesota Public Radio cut ties with after he was accused of inappropriate behavior. Keillor continues to tour and will host the "A Prairie Home Companion" Caribbean Cruise in March.
Louis C.K. did suffer professional consequences. Along with the canceled release of his film "I Love You, Daddy," FX Networks cut its professional ties with him, and his character from the 2016 animated children's film "The Secret Life of Pets" was voiced by Patton Oswalt for the movie's 2019 sequel.
But he's continued to perform live stand-up. Following a number of small-scale shows, he launched this international comeback tour in late 2019.
"Louis C.K. doesn't need Netflix and NBC and CBS so he can work again," said Deraney.
"He can go into Bob's Comedy Club in Toledo, Ohio, and make a couple thousand dollars, whereas for someone like Kevin Spacey to work, he needs to have some sort of a production company," Deraney said. "He has a luxury that other people don't in that he can perform to a half house or a full house and I don't think he cares if he is going to be protested or if one person out of 50 is going to say something."
Jess Alaimo, a 32-year-old comedian living in Asbury Park, shared Moroski's belief that, in the end, money trumps outrage. She will not support the State Theatre after its choice to book Louis C.K., she said.
"It's about money, and if people are going to see him, he's going to be booked. You can't expect people wanting to make money to have good morals," said Alaimo. "It's about our culture and why this matters for women and why it's not OK. Until we address the culture, people like Louis will be booked."
Patricia Teffenhart, executive director of New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said that people shouldn't be profiting off of sexual misconduct.
"I would like to see that we wouldn't be looking to profit off other people's trauma," she said.
According to Teffenhart, the 21 county-based sexual violence service programs that the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault works with served 19,000 victims and their loved ones last year, an increase from the average 10,000 victims per year and their loved ones over the past six years.
"In this scenario with Louis C.K., the most dramatic impact we can have is to not invest our financial resources see his performance," said Teffenhart. "I certainly would never intend to invest my money to sit in an audience where we are going to hear the traumatic effects he's had on other peoples' lives."
A 'tone-deaf' show During an early 2019 comedy show in San Jose, California, Louis C.K. joked, "I like to jerk off, and I don't like being alone," according to the Daily Beast and other news sources.
Throughout the years before Louis C.K. was accused by the five women, he also joked about masturbation – at least 17 times from 2005 through 2017, according to an article by The Cut.
But Louis C.K. is now taking measures to try to keep questionable material from his shows from being recorded or shared.
Last May, a strict policy for all of his shows was announced which does not allow audience members to bring their phones or share material from his performance in any way, shape or form without his express consent.
Upon arrival to the venues, all phones and smartwatches are secured in Yondr pouches – basically a bag that seals up your phone – that are opened at the end of the shows – a practice that's become increasingly common at concerts, film festivals and other events.
In the first shows of Louis C.K.'s new tour hosted in Richmond, Virginia, on Nov. 2, the comedian stuck to subjects that fans have come to expect from him, including Sept. 11, slavery, pedophilia and the Holocaust.
According to a New York Times review of one of the Richmond shows, "Those looking for any apologetic notes or reckoning with the damage he has done will be disappointed. He is not aiming for redemption onstage. If anything, he's doubling down on the comedic value of saying the wrong thing."
Teffenhart finds Louis C.K.'s ability to joke and profit off his past behavior perhaps most alarming of all.
"What's troubling about this scenario is the doubling down on the content in his bit – there doesn't seem to be remorse," she said. "He's using the experiences that have caused trauma to others to continue to make money, and that is to me where we have to draw a distinct line. I can't speak to whether he's changed his behavior, but the tone seems to imply that there's not a lot of remorse."
Keith Corcoran of Matawan said he will be attending one of the State Theatre shows with his mother and sister as a family celebration for his sister's 45th birthday. All three, Corcoran said, are fans of Louis C.K. dating back to his 2006 HBO series, "Lucky Louie."
He had bought his sister and mother tickets to see the comedian at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan a few years ago, but Corcoran's mother suffered an injury at the train station and had to miss the show.
"Yes, it's kind of strange to be taking both my 67-year-old mother and 45-year-old sister to this," Corcoran said via email, "but my mother is a retried psychiatric ward nurse and my sister runs a nursing home so they are well versed in the horrors of life and the human condition."
Chelsea Moroski is a 26-year-old comedian living in North Brunswick. "I'm not shocked that people are buying tickets" for Louis C.K.'s shows, she says. "No matter what the industry, people who do bad things are usually not given the repercussions that they should."

'Politics of hate' take a toll on German mayors Some towns unable to field candidates for leadership at all

Texto completo: COLOGNE, Germany - The last time Henriette Reker ran for mayor, she was nearly killed.
Reker was handing out flowers to voters at a bustling market in Cologne, Germany, in 2015 when a man took a rose with one hand and rammed a kitchen knife into her throat with the other. He wanted to punish her for her pro-refugee stance.
Five years later, Reker is running again. But she is an exception. Since she recovered from a coma to find herself elected, far-right death threats have become an everyday reality, not just for her but for an increasing number of local officials across Germany.
The acrimony is felt in town halls and village streets, where mayors find themselves the targets of threats and intimidation. The effect has been chilling.
Some have stopped speaking out. Many have quit, tried to arm themselves or taken on police protection. The risks have mounted to such an extent that some German towns are unable to field candidates for leadership at all.
"Our democracy is under attack at the grassroots level," Reker said in a recent interview in Cologne's City Hall. "This is the foundation of our democracy, and it is vulnerable."
The trend, local officials and analysts said, reflects a worrying breakdown of civility and political discourse in a polarized Germany, where the insidious influence of an angry far right is changing the rules of behavior.
Mayors have not been the only ones to suffer as Germany's political and social fabric has strained. The shootings last week in the western town of Hanau, near Frankfurt, that left 11 people dead were just the latest attacks aimed at ethnic minorities.
Germans who openly support immigration have been targeted, too. Given the decentralized nature of Germany's political system, local officials like mayors may be the most important among them. Attacks against them take on outsize significance.
Over the last year, there were 1,240 politically motivated attacks on politicians and elected officials in Germany, according to preliminary figures released this year by federal police.
A study conducted by the German Association for Cities and Municipalities showed that 40% of the country's city governments had to contend with stalking, harassment or threats. Of the 11,000 mayors in the country, at least 1,500 reported concrete threats.
And people have died. In June, Walter Lübcke, a regional official, was killed on his front porch by a known extremist, the first far-right assassination of a German politician since World War II.
Supporters of far-right ideology were responsible for more than one-third of the reported episodes, nearly twice as many as were committed by supporters of the extreme left, the government said.
But nearly half of all politically motivated attacks could not be attributed to any specific group, reflecting what experts said showed the erosion of civil norms.
Experts and local officials who have been affected said the violence started when the 2008 economic crisis began to bite. But it took on new dimensions in 2015 after Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the borders to more than 1 million asylum-seekers, most of them Muslim and many fleeing wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Andreas Zick, director of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence at the University of Bielefeld, has been tracking the mood of German society for decades.
He said he first noticed groups of people calling themselves "concerned citizens" who were critical of politicians emerge more than a decade ago.
One of their concerns has now grown into a concerted campaign of hate against local politicians and representatives, he said, driven by populist forces such as the far-right Alternative for Germany, a party known by its German initials, AfD.
"The populists have declared the 'elites' as their enemy, and now we are seeing the rise of this politics of hate which has infected the center of society," Zick said.
Barbara Lücke, the mayor of Pulsnitz in the eastern German state of Saxony, has been targeted by hate campaigns.
"The arrival of the refugees was a catalyst," she said, "but it would have happened regardless."
She attributed the rise in violence to a toxic cocktail of an "anything goes" culture on social media, a dearth of social services and a lack of understanding among Germans in the former Communist East about how a representative democracy works.
"We as a society have lost the ability to respect one another, or those in government," said Lücke, an independent.
"There are no boundaries anymore and no understanding for how to respond when my idea of freedom is in conflict with someone else's idea of freedom," she said. "We have forgotten how to resolve conflicts."
By some accounts, the atmosphere has become particularly toxic in eastern Germany, where the AfD wins on average 1 in 4 votes and many more in rural areas.
Burkhard Jung, the mayor of Leipzig, another eastern city, said that in his first nine years as mayor, he did not get a single threat. But that changed when the country took in the refugees.
"Something broke open then - something came out," he said. "These threats would come. We had to install a security system in our house. Police would sometimes be outside.
"How do you explain that to your children?" he added.
In the five years since she was stabbed, Reker, the mayor of Cologne, said anonymous death threats and constituents writing to say they understand those who want her murdered have poured in.
Shortly after the murder of Lübcke, Reker received a letter signed, "Sieg Heil und Heil Hitler!"
"The phase of cleansing has started," it stated. "Many more will follow him. Including you. Your life will end in 2020."
Last month, she buried a City Hall employee who had been stabbed while on the job.
But Reker has refused to change her message. Just recently she asked the Cologne City Council to approve of a plan to welcome 100 additional refugees and 16 unaccompanied child refugees who are stuck in a camp on the Greek island of Lesbos.
The motion was passed. But in response, a representative of the far-right Alternative for Germany, Sven Tritschler, immediately took to the microphone.
"You have blood on your hands," he said.

Friends and relatives hold up photos of victims of a shooting in Hanau on Friday. The rampage is Germany's third deadly far-right attack in a matter of months.

WH OFFICIAL DISMISSES ELECTION MEDDLING REPORTS

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, dismissed reports Sunday that intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Russia is again looking to interfere in the U.S. presidential election with the aim of boosting Trump's reelection bid.
O'Brien, in appearances on CBS' "Face the Nation" and ABC's "This Week," said he had not "received" any intelligence that the Kremlin's election meddling efforts were meant to aid Trump, but also acknowledged that he had not sought out such information.
"There's no briefing that I've received, that the president has received, that says that President [Vladimir] Putin is doing anything to try and influence the elections in favor of President Trump," O'Brien told "Face the Nation" host Margaret Brennan. "We just haven't seen that intelligence. If it's out there, I haven't seen it."
Special counsel Robert Mueller's 22-month investigation into Russian election interference found that Russian operatives "interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion." Adding to Mueller's findings, intelligence officials and FBI Director Chris Wray, in public hearings before lawmakers, have asserted that Russia will look to repeat its efforts in the upcoming presidential election.
The White House in the past week has stepped up its pushback of claims that Russia is trying to aid Trump following reports by The Washington Post and The New York Times indicating that a senior intelligence official told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing last month that Trump was Russia's preferred candidate.
Trump on Twitter called reports that Russia's election meddling was intended to help his candidacy "a hoax" and accused House Democrats of launching "another misinformation campaign."
This past week Trump replaced Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire, with a longtime loyalist, U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grennell, reportedly because Trump was angry about the claim made at the House briefing indicating that Russia sought to aid his reelection.
On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, rejected reports that McGuire's removal was retaliatory.
"The president's frustration was that he wasn't briefed before they were briefed," Short told NBC's "Meet the Press." "So you had midlevel people going up into a very partisan environment that's supposed to be behind closed doors. ... The president's concern was exactly to say, 'Look, if you do that, they're going to say that the Russians are trying to help Donald Trump,' which is exactly what the leak said."
O'Brien, appearing on ABC's "This Week" said all the reports surrounding Russia's preference for Trump were based on "leaks" that came out of the Democrat-controlled House Intelligence Committee, and he had not viewed any information that supported the underlying claims made at the meeting.
Pressed by the show's host, George Stephanopoulos, to state whether he had a "responsibility as national security adviser to find out" directly from intelligence officials about the information that was offered at the House meeting, O'Brien reiterated, "I haven't seen the intel, and I haven't seen that analysis."
"Have you asked for it?" Stephanopoulos said.
O'Brien respond

Texto completo: Is Big Tech "downgrading humanity"? So says former Googler and podcaster Tristan (rhymes with "twist-on") Harris, director of the weirdly named Center for Humane Technology. Mr. Harris and many of his fellow tech skeptics describe humans as little different from pets, believing everyone who uses Facebook or an iPhone is a manipulatable idiot. He couldn't be more wrong.
Mr. Harris preaches about an "attention crisis." OK, you have my attention. Testifying before the Senate last year, he said tech companies are in a "race to the bottom of the brain stem." He also claimed humans in the 21st century still have "Paleolithic emotions." Basically, "we're chimpanzees with nukes." Wait, did he just call you a chimp?
Elsewhere he has claimed that social networks are delivering "outrage that works on the piano key of your nervous system." The man can certainly turn a phrase. He explains that "technology is getting better and better at hacking human weaknesses." And you'd better put down that glass, because "we're drinking from the Flint water supply of information."
Mr. Harris's most fevered claim is that social media has taken over politics. "We're not really in control of world history anymore," he says. "The technology companies that are shaping our information sense-making environment are in control of every major electoral outcome, and whether people believe conspiracy theories." And there it is. It isn't Hillary Clinton's fault she lost in 2016. It was maybe the Russians and certainly Big Bad Tech. Mr. Harris insists "one side is currently winning by there not being regulation." You can probably guess which one he means.
Mr. Harris believes "we've been manipulated into this multiyear-long hypnotic trance," and that "we need someone to snap their fingers and wake all of us up out of this." A savior, a messiah. Might that someone be Mr. Harris?
Alarmism can be a lucrative business. In 2018 Mr. Harris received funding from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. He also has a deal with the brother of climate scold Tom Steyer to spend $7 million and use $50 million of donated media from Comcast and DirecTV, which have their own bone to pick with Big Tech. Maybe that's why Mr. Harris insists that "human downgrading is the climate change of culture." Uh boy.
Last month Mr. Harris asked Congress to launch a massive public-awareness campaign -- "an inoculation campaign," similar to those run in the 1940s by the Committee for National Morale and the Institute for Propaganda Analysis. I'm not kidding.
Every generation goes through tremors when something new arrives. Elvis's hips. Pinball. TV. Rock 'n' roll. Videogames. For the most part, everyone turned out OK. Sure, we've all gone down the rabbit hole of hyperlinks and insect-fighting videos. So what? We're bored.
Mr. Harris is right to say we "need to upgrade human capacity," but the question is how. Social media, which he would kneecap through regulations like banning microtargeted ads, is actually doing that upgrading: training the next generation of knowledge workers, teaching them how to multitask, think in several dimensions, click and swipe their way to information, and find knowledge and solutions in a noisy world. Free 21st-century training.
Most important, users of today's media platforms are getting used to identifying fake news. Sorry, but people aren't stupid. Our internal defenses against deceit and bias go up when inundated and irradiated with nonsense.
News flash: There are charlatans and hucksters in the real world -- in "meat space" -- too. President Trump used a sharpie to fudge hurricane paths. Susan Rice blamed a video for the murders in Benghazi, Libya. The New York Times recently said "mourners" stormed the U.S. Embassy in Iraq last year, much as "students" took over the U.E. Embassy in Iran in 1978. There are free-trade agreements that aren't free. And if you like your doctor . . .
Yes, those under 16 need to limit their use of technology as their brains develop, but not cold turkey. Isn't that the job of parents rather than government or nonprofits? Remember when movies and TV were damaging our minds? Me neither. If anything, traditional media drives conformity, whereas social networks at least allow freedom of expression. Somehow that's now inhumane?
The cries of Mr. Harris and other aggravated social-media critics sound like demands to turn back the clock to simpler times. But there's no putting the toothpaste back in the tube. Only fools will try. For all its flaws, social networks and artificial intelligence keep delivering value and utility to users, training people for a world that moves in nanoseconds. Better to teach the next generation how to keep up. That's humane.

A right to live in a clean place?

Texto completo: VtDigger
MONTPELIER — Fifteen Vermont senators are sponsoring a proposed amendment to the state’s constitution that would give residents the right to “a clean environment.”
Sen. Chris Bray, D-Addison, the chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee and the lead sponsor of the amendment, said he is proposing the amendment to block the Trump administration’s drastic roll-back of environmental regulations in the past few years.
President Donald Trump has restricted 95 environmental rules and regulations since he took office, according to The New York Times, including those governing air pollution and emissions, water pollution, and drilling and extraction.
Bray said the amendment could serve as a “bulwark against many kinds of erosions” of Vermont’s environmental rules, which, in many cases, are stricter than federal regulations.
“As the federal laws recede, this is a perfect time for us to pause, and say ‘Let’s affirm this in the most fundamental way we can,’ which is to express it in our Constitution,” Bray said.
Bray said he doesn’t want to move forward with an amendment that is only symbolic in nature. In the coming weeks, his committee will take testimony on how the constitutional change could protect the state.
He believes it would help shield the state’s environmental rules from future court challenges seeking to weaken them.
“If someone challenges a rule there will be a legal foundation to point to to say ‘Look we have already made explicit and guaranteed to each other the right to clean air and clean water,’” he said.
Two states, Pennsylvania and Montana, have constitutional amendments designed to explicitly protect environmental rights.
As of last year, 13 other states were considering similar “Green Amendments,” according to the environmental publication Grist.
James Ehlers, an environmental advocate and former Democratic candidate for governor, has been pushing for the constitutional changes for four years, and said ongoing water and air pollution in the state demonstrate that added protection is needed.
“Nobody has a right to poison one another and we’re looking forward to that being assured right up there with your right to private property,” Ehlers said.
Sen. President Pro Tem Tim Ashe, D/P Chittenden, expressed skepticism about the amendment.
He pointed to Pennsylvia, which adopted a similar amendment in the 1970s, but has still seen environmental damage from the fracking industry.
“Pennsylvania, I believe, is the state that’s often pointed to and their fracking process leaves one to wonder what the impact of that constitutional language has given, since many people there do not have clean air or clean water,” he said.
Ashe said he was still open to considering the amendment.
“It’s a late-in-the-game one and we will have internal discussions about how and whether we can move it forward in light of everything else going on.”
In order for the Constitution to be amended, the proposition would need to pass the Senate and House once this legislative biennium and again in the next biennium.
It would then go directly to voters for approval on the ballot.
In the last year, the Legislature has already passed two constitutional amendments: one protecting abortion rights in the state, and one that would clarify that slavery and indentured servitude are prohibited “in any form.”

'The Call of the Wild' Is Heard at the Box Office

Texto completo: A new adaptation of the Jack London tale had a good opening this weekend, though it didn't unseat "Sonic The Hedgehog."
The domestic box office was a race between two computer-generated creatures this weekend, as "Sonic the Hedgehog" and "The Call of the Wild" jockeyed for first place.
Paramount Pictures's "Hedgehog," an action-comedy with a blue, fur-covered digital protagonist, had an impressive opening last weekend, and it was expected to hold its lead. While the movie did top the box office this weekend -- with an estimated $ 26.3 million in domestic sales Friday through Sunday -- it was a closer contest than expected.
That was thanks to a surprisingly good showing from the second-place movie: "The Call of the Wild," an adaptation of the Jack London novel that pairs a scruffy Harrison Ford with a digital Bernard-Scotch shepherd mix. Distributed by 20th Century Studios, the film opened to an estimated $ 24.8 million in domestic sales this weekend. That figure is above expectations (prerelease projections had placed it in the teens), though because of the movie's reported $ 135 million budget, it has a long way to go to be profitable.
"The Call of the Wild," directed by Chris Sanders, has a recognizable leading man in Ford, who plays the novel's central human, a rugged outdoorsman. But like the novel, the movie is primarily the story of Buck, a California house dog that finds its way into the wild. This version's fully digital canine received a fair amount of online mockery -- though perhaps not as much as the digital title character of "Sonic the Hedgehog," which was redesigned after audiences ridiculed its appearance in an early trailer.
In his review of "The Call of the Wild" for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that "pondering this interspecies communion -- between a craggy star and a digital dog (based on a man playing a dog) -- may prompt howls into an existential void." But, he added, "as the basis for a family crowd-pleaser, the pairing is often irresistible." Critical response was lukewarm; "The Call of the Wild" currently holds a 63 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

In third was "Birds of Prey" (Warner Bros.), a DC Comics superhero movie in its third weekend. It sold an estimated $ 7 million in tickets according to Comscore, which compiles box office data.
The only newcomer in the top five other than "The Call of the Wild" was "Brahms: The Boy II," a poorly reviewed horror sequel distributed by STX. Its weak opening brought in an estimated $ 5.9 million in domestic sales, placing the movie in competition with Sony's "Bad Boys for Life," which is comparatively ancient (this was its sixth weekend in theaters) but also managed around $ 5.9 million. Final counts on Monday will determine which landed in fourth and which placed fifth.

Texto completo: The iPhone maker, which depends on both factories and consumers in China, could be a bellwether for other big tech companies.
Hello, New York Times tech readers. I'm Nellie Bowles, the tech and culture reporter, here now with the roundup of the news.
It was a week that captured the central issues of tech in 2020: privacy versus the convenience of smart home devices, dependence on the smooth running of China's manufacturing industry, battles over regulation in Europe and the lockdown on internal dissent at Silicon Valley companies.
So to those wanting to take a break from the endless Democratic primary jockeying, settle into a good chair, because what the week brought you is a basket of beautiful tech features.
We begin:
Coronavirus is starting to affect tech production lines and demand for products. Apple cut its sales expectations for the quarter, citing the virus's impact on factories and stores. The warning was a clear indication of how big the company has bet on China and how the impact of the outbreak might ripple out into the global economy, explored in an article by Daisuke Wakabayashi.
Amazon executives are also preparing for coronavirus disruptions. An article by Karen Weise and Michael Corkery outlined the measures the company is taking to hedge against the potential that the impact of the virus gets worse. The Everything Store is "making larger and more frequent orders of Chinese-made products that had already been shipped to the United States," they wrote.
But at the same time, some suppliers are trying to lower demand, cutting back on advertising and promotions so they don't run out of stuff.
Privacy debates and doorbells
Speaking of Amazon: Not everyone agrees on where to draw the line between privacy and convenience, sometimes not even everyone in the same house. One couple fighting over whether to keep an Alexa-enabled Echo speaker in the home invented their own solution: a bracelet of silence that jams microphones. Wear it and it's like smart-home armor. The tale of the couple, two computer science professors, was brought to us by Kashmir Hill.
But if you do agree on getting something that records video and listens -- especially a Ring doorbell -- there are some privacy best practices, which Brian X. Chen outlined in his latest Tech Fix column. There are many, many steps required, including getting a burner phone number. And his conclusion: "If that all sounds like a lot of effort just to use a security camera, that's because the security concerns make Ring products impractical to own."
In Europe, leaders are very good at regulating technology, pioneering responses to issues of privacy and antitrust, but can it build tech giants of its own? My colleagues Adam Satariano and Monika Pronczuk wrote: "As Europe has created a reputation as the world's most aggressive watchdog of Silicon Valley, it has failed to nurture its own tech ecosystem. That has left countries in the region increasingly dependent on companies that many leaders distrust." Now it is trying to change that and reclaim "technological sovereignty."
Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley companies have been making more trips to Brussels recently to lobby against some of that regulation: a new digital policy, including first-of-its-kind rules on the ways that artificial intelligence can be used by companies, Adam wrote.
Some stories you shouldn't miss
Noam Scheiber and Kate Conger had a big story in the The New York Times Magazine on the Great Google Revolt: what happened when a group of employees tried to make the company stop doing work they saw as unethical.
Mostly, they were fired. Dive into the article to understand how Google went from an ultra-transparent company that encouraged employee dissent to, well, not.
The Style section's Penelope Green took us to deathbeds. As more people choose to die at home and more families have smartphones, deathbed photos are returning.
"What's happening now is that people are taking back that process," said Stanley B. Burns, 81, an ophthalmologist who runs the Burns Archive, a collection of post-mortem and medical photos. "But the impulse to photograph is the same as it was for the Victorians."
Our colleague in Opinion, Susan Fowler, shook the tech world in 2017 when she wrote a first-person account of working at Uber and suffering the indignities and discrimination of a sexist, start-up workplace.
Her memoir, "Whistleblower: My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber," is out now, and the Book Review called it "a powerful illustration of the obstacles our society continues to throw up in the paths of ambitious young women."
Marker, a new business site by Medium, is rolling out some great stories this week including a series on "The New Rules of the I.P.O."
Kickstarter officially voted to unionize. There have been large efforts to organize tech labor, but many have faltered.
San Diego is likely to recognize Instacart workers as employees rather than independent contractors, according to a story in Bloomberg Law.
A general reminder from The New York Times Magazine's Future of Work issue: Professional video game players are in high demand as the industry competes for talent, and now they make even more money.
According to Newzoo, a games-and-e-sports analytics company, competitive e-sports revenue last year was about $ 1.1 billion, an almost 27 percent increase from 2018, Robert Capps wrote. So, in conclusion, get in while the getting is good.

Texto completo: Acclaimed in London, the two-part play about gay culture and the legacy of AIDS drew a chillier response in New York, where it is set.
"The Inheritance," an ambitious two-part play exploring contemporary gay life, will end its Broadway run on March 15 after a twisty journey that saw the show soar in London but sink in New York.
The play, written by Matthew Lopez and directed by Stephen Daldry, was inspired by E.M. Forster's masterful novel "Howards End," and similarly explores issues of class and real estate through the intersecting relationships of a small group of people. In "The Inheritance," which is set in and around New York City, the intergenerational relationships are shadowed by differing experiences of the AIDS epidemic.
The play, which began previews Sept. 27 and opened Nov. 17, is presented in two parts, each running nearly 3 hours and 15 minutes. At the time of its closing, there will have been a total of 46 previews and 138 regular performances (each part is counted as a single performance).
The play, with Tom Kirdahy, Sonia Friedman and Hunter Arnold as lead producers, was capitalized for about $ 9.1 million, according to a spokesman, and will close at a loss. It opened in New York to mixed reviews, and struggled at the box office; during the week that ended Feb. 16 it grossed $ 345,984, which is just 33 percent of its potential, and played to houses that were only half full.
The New York failure came as a surprise because the show was hailed as a triumph in London, where it first opened. It won four Olivier Awards -- the British equivalent of the Tonys -- including one for best new play. And some of the reviews were rapturous; in The Telegraph, the critic Dominic Cavendish described it as "perhaps the most important American play of the century so far" and said, "Star ratings are almost beside the point when confronted by work of this magnitude but hell, yeah, five."
The reception in New York was polarized but chillier. Ben Brantley, writing in The New York Times, said, "Its breadth doesn't always translate into depth." And although many theatergoers found the play profoundly moving, others were quite critical.
Lopez, writing in The New York Times, explained his thinking. "I wanted to write a play that was true to my experience, my philosophy, my heart as a gay man who has enjoyed opportunities that were denied Forster," he said. "It was my attempt to explain myself to the world as a gay man of my particular generation. I wasn't attempting to create a generationally defining work of theater that spoke for the entire queer experience."

Reid Calls For Nevada To Switch To Primary

Texto completo: "They don't work for a multitude of reasons," the former Senate majority leader said, adding to the push for Democrats to switch to primaries in all states.
LAS VEGAS -- Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader who remains the functional head of the Nevada Democrats, said on Sunday that caucuses should no longer be used to nominate candidates for president of the United States.
"Our Democratic Party did a good job," Mr. Reid said in an email to The New York Times. "All caucuses should be a thing of the past. They don't work for a multitude of reasons."
Mr. Reid's call to end caucuses adds to the growing momentum around the push for Democrats to shift their presidential nominating contests from caucuses to primaries.
It follows the fiasco this month in Iowa, when state party officials failed to report any results until 22 hours after caucuses began, and the slow-going count in Nevada, where just 60 percent of precincts have reported results in the more than 24 hours since most caucuses closed.
A few hours after his email exchange with The Times, Mr. Reid released a statement reiterating his call last week for Nevada to jump ahead of Iowa and New Hampshire on the presidential nominating calendar.
"I firmly believe that Nevada, with our broad diversity that truly reflects the rest of the country, should not just be among the early states," Mr. Reid said. "We should be the first in the nation."
He added, "I believe it's time for the Democratic Party to move to primaries everywhere."
The Democratic National Committee will not take up the matter of which states will get to go first in the next presidential contest until at least 2021, and no vote on the issue is likely until 2022.
The party began to move away from caucuses during the aftermath of the nasty 2016 race between Hillary Clinton, the eventual nominee, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
After Mr. Sanders and his allies claimed he was cheated out of a caucus victory in Iowa because of irregularities in the reporting process, the Democratic National Committee incentivized caucus states to shift to primaries. Only Iowa, Nevada, North Dakota and Wyoming, along with three territories, are holding caucuses this year.
Still, Mr. Reid's call to end caucuses is a remarkable statement from the man who is single-handedly responsible for Nevada's caucuses occupying the third slot on the Democrats' presidential nominating calendar.
He engineered Nevada's shift to earlier in the year, just behind Iowa and Hampshire, for the 2008 presidential cycle. Nevada has since become ensconced, with those two states and South Carolina, at the beginning of both parties' nominating processes.
The Nevada Democrats have been slow to count and report caucus results partly thanks to new D.N.C. rules that require caucus sites to report not just the number of delegates won by each candidate, but also the raw number of supporters for each candidate.
The presidential campaign of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., on Sunday cited "irregularities" in the results reported by Nevada Democrats and called on the state party to release a raft of new data. The results reported so far show Mr. Buttigieg in third place.
Both the Sanders and Buttigieg campaigns voiced grievances after Iowa's caucuses and pointed to math errors in the allotment of delegates from precincts across the state. Iowa Democratic Party rules, however, declared that the caucus worksheets served as the official records, even if the math was incorrect.
Mr. Sanders, who lost Iowa to Mr. Buttigieg by a fraction of a delegate, claimed victory anyway because the raw supporter totals -- recorded and released for the first time this year -- showed him with 6,000 more votes than Mr. Buttigieg on the caucuses' first alignment.
Nevada Democrats have previously sought to shift from a presidential caucus to a primary, but Republicans in control of state government have refused to fund presidential primary elections. Democrats now control every level of state government in the state, after Gov. Steve Sisolak won the governorship in the 2018 midterm elections.

Texto completo: The 18th season of the singing competition debuts on NBC. And Netflix releases a vibrant comedy-drama about a Mexican-American restaurant owner.
What's on TV
THE VOICE 8 p.m. on NBC. This singing competition is back for its 18th season, with Nick Jonas replacing Gwen Stefani as a coach. Episode 1 kicks off the competition's blind auditions. Here, singers vying for the chance to be on the show -- and mentored by Jonas, John Legend, Kelly Clarkson or Blake Shelton -- will audition only with their voices. Later stages of the competition include singing battles and rehearsed performances, with the guest artists Dua Lipa, Ella Mai and Bebe Rexha, as well as Kevin and Joe Jonas.
BLACK IN SPACE: BREAKING THE COLOR BARRIER 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Smithsonian. On Aug. 30, 1983, the astronaut Guion Bluford embarked as a crew member of the Space Shuttle Challenger, making him the first African-American in space. This documentary features him alongside Edward Dwight, an Air Force pilot edged out of a position with NASA, and Frederick Gregory, the first African-American to command a NASA mission, to examine the complications of sending a black man into space during the Cold War. Also included are Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez, the first Cuban astronaut sent into space by the Soviet Union, and Ronald McNair, an African-American pilot who died in the Challenger disaster in 1986.
What's Streaming
GENTEFIED Stream on Netflix. At the center of this show tackling gentrification is Casimiro (Joaquín Cosío), a struggling Mexican restaurant owner in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. He's aided by his grandchildren, who aim to strike a balance between tradition and modernity: Chris (Carlos Santos), an aspiring chef; Ana (Karrie Martin), an ambitious artist; and Erik (J.J. Soria), who helps Casimiro run the restaurant. In his review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik wrote that the series sometimes "wants to be a sharp-elbowed satire." But "sometimes -- more effectively," he adds, "it's a working-class family dramedy, conscious of the cascading effects of small financial setbacks and the code-switching involved in moving across cultures."
HUNTERS Stream on Amazon. "The show has us at Al Pacino," Mike Hale wrote in his review for The Times, noting a star-studded cast in this new series about World War II vigilantes. After the grandmother of 19-year-old Jonah Heidelbaum (Logan Lerman) is killed, he crosses paths with Meyer Offerman (Pacino), a concentration camp survivor who has assembled a group of Nazi hunters. The show takes place in the 1970s, and Meyer has reason to believe the Reich is again attempting world domination; this time, in America. The moral dilemma of the plot is easy enough to predict: Is vigilante killing, even of Nazis, really justified?

Wall Street Journal's China staff protests the newspaper's 'sick man' headline

Texto completo: The Wall Street Journal's China staff is urging the newspaper to apologize for a headline that prompted the Chinese government to expel three of its journalists last week.
The email from the Journal's China bureau to the top officers of the paper's parent companies, in effect, sides with the Chinese, who have demanded an apology and retaliated with the expulsions last week.
The headline in question " 'China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia' " appeared on an opinion column written by academic and foreign affairs specialist Walter Russell Mead in the Journal on Feb. 3. The column was a commentary on the health of China's financial markets, rather than a reference to the coronavirus outbreak there.
Chinese officials and ordinary citizens have protested that 'sick man' is a racist phrase once used by Westerners to denigrate China during and immediately after the era in which colonial powers dominated and exploited the nation.
The protests led the government on Wednesday to revoke the press credentials of three Journal reporters, giving them five days to leave the country in the largest such action against Western journalists since 1989.
The Journal has expressed 'regret' over the headline but has not apologized or amended it.
'We . . . ask you to consider correcting the headline and apologizing to our readers, sources, colleagues and anyone else who was offended by it,' said an email sent on behalf of Journal employees by Jonathan Cheng, the Journal's bureau chief in Beijing, to William Lewis, the Journal's publisher and chief executive of Dow Jones - Co., and Lewis's boss, Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corp.
The email added, 'This is not about editorial independence or the sanctity of the divide between news and opinion. It is not about the content of Dr. Mead's article. It is about the mistaken choice of a headline that was deeply offensive to many people, not just in China.
'We find the argument that no offense was intended to be unconvincing: Someone should have known that it would cause widespread offense. If they didn't know that, they made a bad mistake, and should correct it and apologize.'
The email, sent Thursday, was signed by 53 members of the Journal's China staff and 'other colleagues involved in our coverage,' it said. Cheng was not among its signatories but sent a separate email endorsing the staff's stance.
In a separate email, also obtained by The Washington Post, Cheng told the two senior executives that their 'proper handling of this matter is essential to the future of our presence in China.'
Journal spokesman Steve Severinghaus indicated Saturday that the Journal's position has not changed.
'We understand the extreme challenges our employees and their families are facing in China,' he said in a statement. '. . . The experience of working through coronavirus and the expulsion of close colleagues is in credibly difficult, and we have encouraged open conversations about their concerns so that we can offer support.'
He added, 'Dow Jones will continue to push for the unfair action against [the paper's journalists] to be reversed and for their visas to be reinstated.'
China has periodically punished Western journalists by denying them entry to the country or by not renewing their visas. But expulsions are rare. Until acting against the Journal this week, the government hadn't kicked out a credentialed journalist since 1998, according to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China.
The government's action brought a rebuke from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said in a statement, 'Mature, responsible countries understand that a free press reports facts and expresses opinions. The correct response is to present counter arguments, not restrict speech.' Pompeo himself recently booted a reporter from NPR off his media plane in apparent retaliation for questions he didn't like in an earlier interview with another NPR journalist.
The staff-written email said the Journal has been attacked for weeks for the headline by Chinese state media and by ordinary people its reporters have met. The state-run Global Times, for example, called the headline 'racist' on Wednesday and demanded that the Journal apologize, as did a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
In a statement issued hours after the expulsions were announced, Lewis, the Journal's publisher, expressed regret but did not offer a formal apology. 'It was not our intention to cause offense with the headline on the piece,' he said. 'However, this has clearly caused upset and concern amongst the Chinese people, which we regret.'
Lewis said in his statement that 'the need for quality, trusted news reporting from China is greater than ever' and that the decision 'to target our News department journalists greatly hinders that effort.'
The Journal is owned by News Corp., whose executive chairman and principal shareholder is media baron Rupert Murdoch.
The controversy comes amid steadily rising tensions between the United States and China over media issues.
China moved against the Journal reporters a day after the Trump administration designated five major Chinese news organizations with U.S. operations as official government entities, effectively labeling them propaganda outlets for Beijing.

Texto completo: When Donald Trump was elected, the media spent months figuring out how to cover a far-from-ordinary presidency.
Some will argue that many journalists never rose to that challenge " that they normalized Trump at every turn and never successfully conveyed to the public a clear and vivid picture of how he has toppled democratic norms and marched the country toward autocracy.
To be sure, they made adjustments.
Big Journalism began to call a lie a lie. It began to call racism by its name. It began to offer fact-checking in real time.
In other words, journalists adapted " within the framework of their tried-and-true beliefs.
We're not 'part of the resistance,' said New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet; 'We're not at war with the administration; we're at work,' Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said. These were thoughtful, reasonable remarks, and they set the tone for much of how the mainstream media " from NPR to the broadcast nightly news to regional newspapers " has proceeded.
And then came Trump's impeachment. And his acquittal. And now, a new era for this president who chooses to believe he's been vindicated.
Call it Trump Unbound.

In this new era, Trump has declared himself the nation's chief law enforcement official. He has pardoned a raft of corrupt officials. He has exacted revenge on those he sees as his impeachment enemies " Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the decorated military veteran and national security staffer; and Gordon Sondland, Trump's own handpicked ambassador to the European Union " simply because they testified under subpoena to what they knew about the White House's dealings with Ukraine.
In other words, we are in entirely new territory now. Should the news media continue as usual? Should it retain its own traditions as the nation slides toward autocracy? Should it treat the Trump presidency as pretty much the usual thing, with a few more fact-checks and the occasional use of a word like 'lie'?
No. We need a new and better approach if we're going to do our jobs adequately.
First, we need to abandon neutrality-at-all-costs journalism, to replace it with something more suited to the moment. Call it Fairness First.
I'm talking about the kind of fairness that serves the public by describing the world we report on in honest and direct terms " not the phony kind of fairness that tries to duck out of difficult decisions by giving 'both sides' of an argument equal time, regardless of their truth or merit.
Now more than ever, with a president feeling empowered and vindictive after his acquittal, we need to apply more scrutiny and less credulity to his increasingly extreme actions and statements.
Second, we need to be far more direct in the way stories are put together and presented.
I often talk to news consumers " citizens by another name " who insist that they want 'just the facts' reporting. They're understandably frustrated that they can't seem to find that when so many news organizations, especially cable news, seem to have chosen political sides for commercial purposes. They want news that is unbiased " that doesn't come with a side helping of opinion. Just tell me what happened, they say. I'll make my own decisions about what it means.
That sounds good in theory. In practice, every piece of reporting on national politics is unavoidably the product of choices: What's the angle? Who is quoted? What's the headline? How much historical context is there? How prominent is it on a front page, a home page, an app?

It's in these small but crucial decisions that mainstream media often fails its audience: We simply are not getting across the big picture or the urgency. This happens, in part, because those news organizations that haven't chosen up sides " those that want to serve all Americans " fear being charged with bias.
And so they soften the language. They blunt the impact.
Take the story of Trump's angry reaction to the warning that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election to help his reelection. After hearing this, he reportedly moved to dump the acting director of national intelligence.
That's big news that ought to be told with real urgency, right?
But not all of mainstream journalism saw it that way. On Friday morning, I searched and scrolled the home page of ABC News, whose evening news show attracts millions every night, the most-watched program of its kind. There were stories about the coronavirus, about the 'mom of Idaho kids arrested in Hawaii,' and even a breathless in-case-you-missed-it piece about new fish sandwiches at Arby's and Bojangles as Lent approaches. I could find the story in question only after a search for the term 'Russia.'
And even those news organizations that did emphasize the story were using words that failed to get the importance across " headline after headline used the word 'meddling' to describe the reported Russian intrusions into America democracy.
Meddling sounds like your nosy neighbor getting involved, over the backyard fence, in your family's squabble.
The Daily Beast was more straightforward: 'Russia Is Helping Elect Trump Again, Intel Official Says.'
There are dozens of examples every day. Too often, news organizations are cautious to a fault, afraid of their own shadows, and worried about being labeled anti-Trump or biased.
In this new era, my prescription is less false equivalence, more high-impact language and more willingness to take a stand for democracy.
With Trump unbound, the news media need to change. Yes, radically. The stakes are too high not to.

Texto completo: For much of the past two decades, the question of how to resolve America’s acute shortage of affordable housing has been strikingly absent from the dominant national discourse.
Even after a trillion dollars in bad mortgages nearly blew up the nation’s financial system, presidential candidates in the 2012 and 2016 elections did not release detailed housing plans. The fact that America’s urban landscape was undergoing a radical shift – in which millions of young and middle-class Americans were being priced out of large cities because of runaway housing prices – was still overshadowed by more immediate concerns, like rising health care costs and the loss of factory jobs.
That changed abruptly over the past year, as the consequences of the nation’s affordable housing crisis became too visible to ignore. Rents had jumped so high in some cities that firefighters and schoolteachers could no longer afford to live near their work. Large homeless camps were sprouting up near the centers of once-affordable cities, from Austin, Texas, to Minneapolis to Seattle. Suddenly, housing was on the national agenda.
Anyone seeking a political remedy to the housing problem would do well to read Conor Dougherty’s “Golden Gates: Fighting for Housing in America,” a painstakingly researched and penetrating analysis of the economic and political forces behind America’s most dysfunctional housing market: San Francisco. Dougherty traces the dire scarcity of affordable housing to warped policies dating back to World War II, as well as to exclusionist ordinances closely intertwined with America’s obsession with single-family homeownership.
Dougherty, an economics reporter at the New York Times, makes a persuasive case that America’s affordable housing shortage cannot be explained by market forces alone; rather it is, at its core, a problem of politics and power. A major culprit is the widespread use of exclusionary zoning – local government ordinances that designate entire communities solely for those who can afford single-family homes, often with minimum lot sizes.
The local restrictions have conspired to limit the supply of housing in large cities – the very places where jobs and economic opportunity have become increasingly concentrated, Dougherty writes.
The results are soaring rents and an unconscionable housing gap: In America’s cities, there are only 37 affordable apartment units for every 100 low-income renters. Between 2011 and 2017, nearly 4 million low-cost units that rent for under $800 a month have vanished from the nation’s housing stock, according to an annual report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
These nationwide trends have been magnified in California – where anti-growth movements and “Not-in-my-backyard” (NIMBY) activism have been a fixture of the political landscape since the 1970s. But Dougherty avoids the tendency, common in books about economic hardship, to portray people as passive victims of forces beyond their control. Instead, he provides us with richly layered portraits of people seeking, in different ways, to correct the injustices caused by ruthless speculation and exclusionary housing policies. They include a young math teacher so frustrated by sky-high rents that she builds a national movement of pro-housing agitators, known as YIMBY (Yes-in-my-backyard); a Catholic nun who battles real estate speculators; and a city manager who quits his job rather than continue to support exclusionary zoning measures.
Dougherty does not shy away from the complexity of his subject matter, and he illuminates the many contradictions of national and local housing policies. Lost in the debate on rent control, for instance, is the recognition that America has long sought to protect homeowners from wild swings in housing prices by subsidizing fixed-rate mortgages. Rent control, he notes, is little more than an attempt by tenants to get the same kind of protections as homeowners.
Ultimately, Dougherty concludes, “There’s no way to rectify a housing shortage other than to build housing, and there’s no way to take care of people whom the private market won’t take care of other than subsidies or rent control, or both. The details are democracy.”

Texto completo: ELY, NEV. - Sen. Amy Klobuchar returned to Minnesota on Saturday to regroup as voters started caucusing in Nevada, a state where she was not expected to be competitive with the leaders in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Trailing in early results, Klobuchar told supporters in Las Vegas and Minneapolis that she was focused on the critical March 3 Super Tuesday contests, which will include Minnesota and 14 other states and territories and award more than half of the delegates needed to head the party's fall ballot.
Speaking to reporters before leaving Nevada, Klobuchar said she had deployed staff "quickly here as well as other places" after the contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, which boosted her hopes of breaking into the top tier of contenders.
"We knew we also wanted to not put everything here because we have all these Super Tuesday states" on the horizon, she said.
While Klobuchar faced steep odds in Nevada, her caucus strategy mirrored that of the previous states where she focused on rural, small-town precincts where she might pick up support from moderate Democrats, independents, and even former supporters of President Donald Trump.
With the next primary on Saturday in South Carolina, a state with a large black electorate, Klobuchar planned to travel instead on Sunday to North Dakota and the Super Tuesday states of Arkansas and Oklahoma, where she is more likely to win delegates.
As the votes were being counted in Nevada, Klobuchar rallied with supporters at her national headquarters in northeast Minneapolis before attending a fundraiser across town to replenish her campaign coffers.
"As usual, I think we have exceeded expectations," Klobuchar said, vowing to go on to South Carolina and Super Tuesday. "A lot of people didn't think I'd be standing at this point."
Elizabeth Weilandgruber, a 44-year-old teacher from Minneapolis, said she's "still optimistic" about the senator's prospects, despite the disappointing finish in Nevada. "I think the more people get to know her and hear what she has to say and what she can represent, the more people are going to realize what a great candidate she is," she said. "I really believe she could take on Trump, and that's priority number one."
In an interview, Klobuchar emphasized her campaign's recent strides. "We were at very little support even a month ago," she said. "So we've been going up slowly but surely and our real focus right now is on Super Tuesday and of course South Carolina. We always knew when we had that surge in New Hampshire and got a lot of money only two weeks ago, we were not as well known in Nevada, but we feel good we got a significant percentage of the vote."
Her strong showing in New Hampshire helped raise more than $12 million, but the race has gone nationwide, forcing her to scale up her staff and volunteer presence from coast to coast.
Voters' lack of familiarity with Klobuchar was evident in some parts of Nevada. At a caucus in Ely, in the desolate, northeastern part of the state, Sanders supporters seemed to predominate.
Amber Purinton Lani showed up to caucus for Sanders and admitted she didn't know much about Klobuchar, who had to play catch-up to other candidates campaigning in Nevada after spending most of her time and resources on Iowa and New Hampshire.
"She's cool, too. I like a lot of the things she has to say," said Purinton Lani. "Honestly, I like a lot of the candidates because our country is going to hell in a handbasket and we need a change, but I agree with Bernie on basically everything he says."
Ely is the largest town for more than 60 miles in all directions, and some voters drove more than an hour to caucus at its high school Saturday.
Janielle Baker drove 65 miles from her cattle ranch in Baker to caucus for Klobuchar. She said she was raised Republican and identifies as Libertarian, but she's worried about the direction of the country and she likes Klobuchar's moderate views.
"I'd have an incredibly difficult time voting if it were Bernie Sanders or Trump," she said.
But for others, Klobuchar's centrist positions were a turnoff. Arla Ruggles from Cherry Creek said she couldn't caucus for Klobuchar because of her record on the environment. "She's pro-corporate, pro-mining, anti-wolf," she said. "I just can't."
Klobuchar said that her national reputation is still building. She cited endorsements from large newspapers, including the New York Times, the Houston Chronicle and the San Francisco Chronicle.
"The newspaper endorsements are going to help me in states that don't know me as well," Klobuchar told reporters in Las Vegas.

We are living in post-integrity America

Texto completo: Back during the scandal over his sexual exploitation of a young intern, Bill Clinton was pilloried in this space for his moral defects.
To which many liberals responded with derision. Morality? What did that matter? The economy was good, we were at peace and Clinton was hardly the first man to fool around and lie about it. As one reader put it, he was hired to be a president, not a pope.
At the time, that felt like a rationalization. A generation later, it feels like a portent. Indeed, it is often said that we are living now in Post-Fact America but truth is, we are also living in Post-Integrity America.
No, that’s not breaking news. But it’s been brought into painfully clear focus these last few days.
One watched not with surprise anymore, but surely with dread and fascination as Donald Trump launched his post-impeachment purge of aides deemed insufficiently sycophantic. But that was just a prelude.
Last week, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 people, most of them guilty of lying, fraud, corruption, tax evasion and similar crimes. In other words, the kinds of things of which Trump has often been accused.
The power to soften or wipe away criminal convictions is one of the nicer perks of the presidency, allowing compassion to be shown to those who deserve it. And in fairness, several of those who benefited last week seem to meet that standard. Crystal Munoz, for instance, had been sentenced to almost 20 years for dealing pot.
But it is worth noting that every person Trump pardoned or gave clemency came to his attention not through the normal machinery of government, but through inside connections or else, as The New York Times noted, “were promoted on Fox News.” Some were championed by aides and allies. Some had donated big money to his campaign. And again, most had breached the public trust.
Like former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who had served eight years of a 14-year sentence for trying to sell Barack Obama’s vacated Senate seat. Trump, who has opined how unfair it is that U.S. companies are not allowed to pay bribes to do business overseas, had called that sentence “ridiculous.”
It’s no great leap to suggest that he sees himself in Blagojevich. Or in former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and financier Michael Milken, whom he pardoned for tax fraud and securities fraud, respectively.
If granting clemency and pardons opens a window upon a president’s moral priorities and it does the view offered here suggests an unfortunate affinity for scammers and grifters, an empathy for those on the make, cutting deals, cutting corners, living the dream, until they got caught up by pesky rules designed to enforce integrity. And if those same people happened to give him money or had their names whispered into his ear by a friend, so much the better.
That’s not how this is supposed to work.
Trump has stamped himself upon this era while ignoring the very idea of personal authority or moral suasion and daring us to care. But we had better. By his lack of personal character, Trump threatens our national character. And he stamps this era with the signature lesson of his life:
Once you give up integrity, it’s easy to give up everything else.

Texto completo: When Marc Morgan tried lysergic acid diethylamide, better known as LSD or acid, for the first time as a teenager, he noticed that he could emotionally disconnect from traumatic memories of the sexual abuse he had suffered as a child.
"It allowed me to dissociate from the sharp pain that a lot of these memories can bring up, which caused me to shy away from processing them," said Morgan, who has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the abuse. "I was able to confront the topic in a more analytical way that felt healthier."
Years later, Morgan learned about microdosing - taking tiny portions of psychedelic substances, as little as a 20th of a recreational dose, to get positive effects, such as more focus and emotional balance, without negatives such as hallucinations and disorientation. He realized that taking small doses allowed him to process his emotions without the stronger, visual effects and looping thoughts.
"It's basically like taking a cup of coffee," said Morgan, now 30. He said that he takes a full dose once or twice a year, and microdoses about four times a year. "You're just able to be a little more free and a little more honest with your emotions without breaking down. There's more of a mental clarity."
Morgan, who has lived in Philadelphia for a decade, is part of a group of people who use both full doses and microdoses of psychedelic substances to process trauma, and better deal with depression. For some, it's because conventional antidepressants haven't worked for them. Others choose psychedelics because it's a more affordable option than therapy or medication.
However, medical experts don't recommend self-medicating.
"For people interested in a treatment who can't get into a trial, this is not the only thing out there," said Matthew Johnson, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who has studied psychedelics for more than 15 years. "It's one promising thing, and it's important for people to stay in treatment."
The brain on psychedelics
In recent months, the use of psychedelics for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD - meaning patients do not respond to medication or therapy - has become a hot topic in the mental-health field. The Food and Drug Administration approved a nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) last March, which uses a derivative of the hallucinogenic ketamine called esketamine. It is the first new antidepressant in decades. (It's currently offered at a handful of clinics in the Philadelphia area.)
In November, the FDA gave psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound found in magic mushrooms, its second "breakthrough therapy" designation in just more than a year. The designation fast-tracks the development and review of drugs.
In a 2017 study of psilocybin and depression, researchers at Imperial College London gave psilocybin therapy to 20 patients with treatment-resistant depression, who reported benefits as long as five weeks after treatment. The study found that psilocybin decreased activity in the amygdala, which processes such emotions as fear and anxiety.
"We know that when someone is on a therapeutic dose of a psychedelic, there's a dramatic increase in communication across brain areas," Johnson said. "My theory is that what we're seeing with psychedelic therapy is more like what we normally associate with talk therapy. Psychedelic therapy prompts a therapeutic process, and people learn something by transcending their sense of self and getting out of their own way."
Much less is known about the science behind microdosing psychedelic substances, but a 2019 study by researchers at the University of California-Davis found that the practice can provide relief for symptoms of depression and anxiety in rats.
In addition, a 2019 survey of more than 1,000 people from across the world who microdosed on LSD found that repeated microdoses were followed by "improvements in negative moods, especially depression," as well as increased positive moods and energy levels.
"There really hasn't been substantiation of the claimed benefits of so-called microdoses," Johnson said. "That's not to say the claimed benefits aren't possible."
The benefits people feel from microdosing might be from a combination of a strong placebo effect and some possible benefit from "tinkering with the serotonin system," Johnson said. But he's open to the potential benefits of microdosing, particularly for depression.
As a result of their research on how psychedelics can be used to help smokers and cancer patients, Johnson and others at Johns Hopkins have suggested that psilocybin's FDA classification should be changed from Schedule I, which means that it has no known medical benefit, to Schedule IV, similar to prescription drugs.
Victor Pablo Acero, a 24-year-old bioengineering doctoral candidate and executive director of the Penn Society for Psychedelic Science, said that accepting both full doses and microdoses as mental-health treatments is an important step in destigmatizing the substances.
"Having a mystical experience is correlated with actually getting more clinical effects," Acero said. "Microdosing doesn't recapitulate the mystical experience or ego death. Also, psychedelic use ... does not magically heal you; you have to put in work and effort to integrate your experience."
Acero said that he became interested in psychedelics once he began reading research papers about how the substances can be used in clinical settings. But he said that research in this area is still lacking.
"Funding is nonexistent," Acero said. "Scientists are having to argue that they need funding to study the medical purposes of a substance that's classified as having no medical purposes."
Most people suffering from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, or PTSD won't be able to access the new treatments for at least a few years, as research groups run clinical trials. The trials have a limited number of spaces - the Usona Institute, a nonprofit medical research group in Wisconsin, recruited just 80 participants for a study that's part of a Phase 2 clinical trial for psilocybin. Similarly, LSD is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial as a treatment for depression in Switzerland. MDMA, better known as ecstasy or molly, is currently in a Phase 3 large-scale clinical trial for PTSD. Upon FDA approval, the SoundMind Center, based in West Philly, will open a clinic in Cedar Park offering MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to populations with higher rates of PTSD.
While patients wait, self-medication without the aid of a therapist or medical professional is much more common, although it is not recommended. Johnson said that there are risks to psychedelic therapy for people with existing psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia.
"Even if this stuff is approved, it's not going to work for everyone," Johnson said.
Changing perceptions
Aysha Ali, who struggles with depression and anxiety, began using full doses and microdoses of magic mushrooms about two years ago. Ali, 21, said antidepressants caused such side effects as appetite loss, decreased libido, and nausea. She also found that mushrooms are more accessible and cheaper for her.
"It's definitely easier to go to bed at night," said Ali, who lives in Wilmington and works in King of Prussia. "I'm a little more focused, and I feel like I can smile and giggle in the moment. I can feel myself going through my day a little bit better, and the days after feel so much better."
She said that it refreshes her brain and allows her to wake up with a positive attitude.
"It helps me see that I'm not going to be stuck where I am," Ali said. "It's not a cure for everything, but the scientific information we're getting now is helping people get out of this mind-set of 'This is bad.' "
Mike Allebach, a photographer who lives in Montgomery County, first learned about magic mushrooms for mental health through a New York Times article last year.
"It didn't really quite match up with my understanding of mushrooms," said Allebach, 37.
Allebach, who was struggling with depression when he read the article, said that he later tried magic mushrooms in California, where psilocybin mushrooms are decriminalized in Oakland and Santa Cruz. The trip brought him out of his depression. Since coming home, Allebach uses breath work and meditation to maintain his mental health.
"As a society, we're in a place where the new rich is feeling calm and having peace," he said. "And if antidepressants don't work for someone, this could be great for someone who wants to be happy again and work on themselves."

Texto completo: In 1999, I traveled to Afghanistan when the Taliban controlled the country.
Swathed in shawls, exiting my taxi only when sneaking into buildings, I visited secret girls' schools in private apartments, where 10-year-olds braved beatings to learn how to read. I interviewed former female university professors who, under the Taliban, could rarely leave their homes, and then only when shrouded beneath a tentlike burka.
And I interviewed then-Taliban deputy health minister Mohammed Abas Stanekzai, who is now one of the negotiators of a "peace deal" with the United States that will probably be signed on Feb. 29, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
So, it is useful to recall what Stanekzai said at the time. He firmly defended excluding girls from schools and women from any Kabul hospital except the sole facility where the Taliban permitted female doctors to work. Moreover, women could seek treatment there only if accompanied by a male relative, even though many war widows had none.
I can't help recalling Stanekzai's remarks as this "peace process" plays out. Much has changed in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, but there's little sign the Taliban has changed its core positions - on women or much else. So don't be fooled by any upbeat administration rhetoric - U.S. talks with the Taliban are still in for a very bumpy ride.
The deal Pompeo cited depends on a precondition: The Taliban must hold to a seven-day significant reduction in violence nationwide, beginning this weekend. That is meant to test whether Taliban leaders can control their fighters.
If the truce holds, intra-Afghan talks will supposedly begin between the Taliban and the elected Afghan government, along with representatives of civil society groups. The process is meant to devise a new political arrangement that would include the Taliban. (As if this isn't sufficiently daunting, the Afghan government is mired in a dispute over election results, which could delay the talks.)
If the United States is satisfied with progress over the next four months, it will start drawing down its 14,000 military personnel according to an agreed-upon timetable, beginning this year. Supposedly, a final withdrawal will depend on the outcome of the talks and on proof the Taliban will prevent any terrorist resurgence.
Yet it's highly unlikely that the Taliban (or its fighters) will be willing to become one political party among many. Its leaders demand a restoration of their former Islamic Emirate, where religious law would replace the Afghan constitution with its guarantees of basic human rights, including for women. They want all U.S. troops out soon, which would mean the Afghan army would collapse.
"The Taliban is poised to take it all," says Marvin Weinbaum, head of the Afghanistan-Pakistan program at the Middle East Institute in Washington. "They know the U.S. is desperate to get out." And the Taliban hopes it can ride U.S. impatience to the victory it can't win in the field.
Toward that end, the Taliban is already trying to airbrush its history. On Friday, the New York Times ran an op-ed by its deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is on the U.S. terrorist list, in which he claims "we were forced to defend ourselves" and "the killing must stop." He portrays himself as speaking for all Afghans.
You'd never know from this puff piece that his Haqqani network helped Osama bin Laden escape - and carried out horrendous suicide-bomber attacks on Afghan civilians in Kabul.
You'd never know that much of Afghanistan is fearful of a Taliban return - as I heard over and over when visiting Afghan villages during the 2000s - because they think the group and its fighters distort Islam. You'd never know that Afghan Hazaras - a Shiite ethnic group who make up 10% to 20% of the total population - are terrified, because the Pashtun Sunni Taliban slaughtered them under its rule.
And you'd never know that a new generation of educated Afghans, including female teachers, lawyers, judges, and journalists - who consider America an ally - don't want to return to the days of burkas, male guardianship, and limited religious education. Under such a regime, their choices would be flight, jail, or worse.
No wonder, the New York Times correspondent in Kabul, Mujib Mashal, tweeted that the Haqqani op-ed "omits the most fundamental fact: that Siraj is no Taliban peace-maker as he paints himself, that he's behind some of the most ruthless attacks of this war with many civilian lives lost."
(I'd add that I find it shocking the Times published this piece without a background note on Haqqani, or a matching piece that challenges his pretensions.)
This U.S.-Taliban deal may present an opportunity, but only if the White House has the patience to hold out for a negotiated solution that precludes a Taliban takeover. And if Trump isn't gulled by Taliban sweet talk and the urge to declare "victory" before November elections.
Bringing all the troops home too soon will destroy any U.S. leverage and hand victory to the Taliban. In that case, this "peace" plan will deliver more tragedy to Afghans and more security threats to the USA.

Texto completo: * Mickey Wright, one of the greatest golfers in the sport’s history, with a picture-perfect swing that enabled her to dominate the women’s game in the 1950s and 1960s, died of a heart attack following a fall Monday at a medical facility in Fort Pierce, Florida. She was 85.
From the late 1950s until her semiretirement in 1969, Wright was the preeminent figure in her sport, once winning 44 tournaments during a four-year span. She played infrequently after age 34, but her 82 tournament victories are the second most in women’s golf history, after Kathy Whitworth’s 88.
Wright was a four-time winner of both the Women’s U.S. Open and the LPGA Tournament, and her 13 wins in major tournaments of the Ladies Professional Golf Association are second only to Patty Berg’s 15.
Experts at Golf and Golf Digest magazines ranked Wright as the greatest female golfer of all time and among the top 10 in history, male or female.
"She was our Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods, Nancy Lopez all rolled into one," Whitworth told Golfweek magazine.
At her peak in the 1960s, Wright was such a popular draw that sponsors refused to hold tournaments unless they knew she would appear. In 1963, she won 13 of the 32 tournaments she entered. Only one male golfer in history — Byron Nelson in 1945 — has won more tournaments in a single year.
But Wright’s influence on the game went beyond the number of her victories. She had a swing and style of play that approached the platonic ideal of golfing perfection.
"Mickey Wright, greatest golf swing I ever saw," Ben Hogan, a star of the 1940s and 1950s, told golf historian Rhonda Glenn in 1988. "Boy, what a swing."
Nelson, Tom Watson and other golfers said the same.
Using a driver with a small, wooden clubhead, Wright could routinely drive the ball 225 to 250 yards. "I can outhit many men — much to their embarrassment," she told Time magazine in 1963.
* Dan Radakovich, who starred as a linebacker at Penn State in the 1950s before winning two Super Bowls as an assistant with the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1970s, died Thursday. He was 84.
* Jean Daniel, a leading intellectual of the French left whose cameos in history included a trip to Cuba in 1963, where he extended to Fidel Castro a tentative overture from President John F. Kennedy and learned while dining with the Communist leader that Kennedy had been fatally shot, died Wednesday at 99.
Once described by the New York Times as a "father confessor to French socialism," Daniel was one of his country’s most prominent journalists for more than half a century — from the Algerian war for independence in the 1950s and early 1960s to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that strained relations between the French and American governments.
* Hair Club for Men founder Sy Sperling, famous for the TV commercials where he proclaimed "I’m not only the Hair Club president but I’m also a client," died Wednesday in Florida after a lengthy illness. He was 78.
* Owen Bieber, who led the United Auto Workers union from the auto industry’s dark days of the early 1980s to the prosperity of the mid-1990s, died Monday. He was 90.
* Ja’Net DuBois, who played the vivacious neighbor Willona Woods on a hit 1970s sitcom and composed and sang "Movin’ on Up" for "The Jeffersons," has died. She kept her age to herself, former "Good Times" co-star and good friend BerNadette Stannis said.
Police in Glendale, California, said they received a report about DuBois’ death late Monday. She appeared to have died of natural causes and no investigation is ongoing, police said.
DuBois won two Emmy Awards for her voice work on the WB series "The PJs."
* The former Manchester United goalkeeper who was called the "hero of Munich" for rescuing two teammates, as well as a baby and her pregnant mother, from the burning fuselage in the 1958 air disaster that killed 23 people died Monday. Harry Gregg was 87.
A former Northern Ireland international, Gregg spent nine years with Manchester United after joining as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper in 1957. He played 247 times for the club, including in a victory in an FA Cup match against Sheffield Wednesday 13 days after the air crash in February 1958.
The team was returning from a European Cup game when their airplane crashed after refueling in Munich. Gregg escaped the wreckage, having sustained only a bloody nose, but returned on two occasions to help teammates Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet and then a 20-month-old girl and her badly injured mother.
Gregg also helped revive United manager Matt Busby, who survived the disaster. Eight United players died in the crash.
* Novelist Charles Portis — a favorite among critics and writers for such shaggy dog stories as "Norwood" and "Gringos" and a bounty for Hollywood whose droll, bloody Western "True Grit" was a best-seller twice adapted into Oscar nominated films — died Monday at his home in Little Rock, Arkansas. He was 86 and had been suffering from Alzheimer’s in recent years.
* British music producer and DJ Andrew Weatherall, who helped bring the underground sounds of acid house to a mass audience, died in a London hospital Monday from a pulmonary embolism. He was 56.
* The four-time Tony Award winner who brought humanity to larger-than-life characters — including the dotty schoolteacher Miss Jean Brodie, aging opera star Maria Callas and the betrayed, murderous Medea — died Feb. 16 at her home in Pound Ridge, New York. Zoe Caldwell was 86 and had suffered from Parkinson’s disease.
The Australian-born actress played in regional theaters around the English-speaking world before becoming the toast of Broadway in 1968, and winning her second Tony, for "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie."
Among her other characters were Cleopatra, Saint Joan, Mother Courage and authors Colette and Lillian Hellman. As she matured, she accepted only roles that offered a particular challenge. If she thought, "Oh, I can do that," she didn’t want to do them, she said in 1986.
Three of her four Tonys came in collaborations with her husband, Robert Whitehead, who was one of Broadway’s most prolific producers of serious drama.
* Tony FernÃ¡ndez, a stylish shortstop who made five All-Star teams during his 17 seasons in the major leagues and helped the Toronto Blue Jays win the 1993 World Series, died Feb. 16 after complications from a kidney disease. He was 57.
FernÃ¡ndez had been in a medically induced coma and had waited years for a new kidney.
He won four straight Gold Gloves with the Blue Jays in the 1980s and holds club records for career hits and games played.
* Kellye Nakahara Wallett, a film and television actress best known for playing Lt. Nurse Kellye Yamato on "M*A*S*H," died Feb. 16 at her Pasadena, California, home after a brief battle with cancer. She was 72.
* Larry Tesler, the Silicon Valley pioneer who created now-ubiquitous computer concepts such as "cut," "copy" and "paste," died Feb. 16. He was 74.
He made using computers easier for generations as a proponent and pioneer of what he called "modeless editing." That meant a user wouldn’t have to use a keyboard to switch between modes to write and edit, for example.
"The inventor of cut/copy & paste, find & replace, and more was former Xerox researcher Larry Tesler. Your workday is easier thanks to his revolutionary ideas," Xerox said in a tweet Wednesday.
* JosÃ© Zalaquett, a Chilean lawyer who was jailed and ultimately expelled from his country for his efforts on behalf of political prisoners and "disappeared" people during the Pinochet dictatorship, a campaign that brought him international renown as a champion of human rights, died Feb. 15 at his home in Santiago. He was 77.
His death was announced by Amnesty International, where he had served as chair of the international executive committee and later as deputy secretary general. The cause was complications from an atypical Parkinsonism disorder, said his wife, Dianora Contramaestre.
Zalaquett — known to friends as Pepe — devoted nearly his entire adult life to the cause of human rights, particularly in his home country, where Gen. Augusto Pinochet led a dictatorship from 1973 to 1990.

Texto completo: "Along the way, he has always been a beacon of light for his family, too, because he always tried to uplift them ... Some of it worked out, some of it failed, but he never, ever turned his back on them. "
Julius Franks
Grew up with Fred Walker
Fred Walker learned how to survive at a young age.
His mother was a drug addict who didn't come home for days at a time. His father wasn't around.
Three younger half-brothers became the responsibility he shouldered before he was 10 years old.
"I always worried about them coming up with a mother on drugs," said Walker, now a York businessman. "My mom would be gone for days, for a week at a time. How do you feed your brothers?"
He vowed early in his life that he wouldn't follow her path, a trail of alcoholism to marijuana use to hard drugs.
But homelessness, hunger and an unstable home life tested him.
He would rely on the kindness of a woman in Philadelphia he refers to as his Godmom, and her guidance. She led him toward a life story he could write himself.
'The only way out of this life' In his teen years in North Philadelphia, Walker grew so desperate for money at one point that he stole a car. A puny kid behind the wheel of a pickup truck, he headed to a chop shop for some cash. The cops spotted him instantly, and he landed in juvenile detention.
"It showed me consequence, number one," he said. "It turned my life around. It showed me I never want to be in this situation."
It also gave him a chance to be a good student in the school residence program, to play basketball, and to not worry about home and the next meal.
"I could be a kid," he said.
But when he got out, his mother didn't want him at home. "I think it was easier (for her) to have less responsibility," he said. Eventually, a friend's mother took him in, gave him a bed and helped him graduate from high school.
"I knew the only way out of this life is education," he said. "Even being homeless at points in my life as a kid, I went to school. People (at school) would say, 'You're dirty. You stink."
They didn't know he lived in abandoned buildings at times.
When Sharon Franks-Govans, "Godmom," took him in, he was a young teenager. Her son, Julius Franks, knew about Walker's situation through a friend, so they gave him a bed for a few days. He stayed for years.
"He was the nicest kid ever. He was just less fortunate than I was at that particular time," said Franks, who is the same age as Walker. Raised for years together, most people now think they are actually brothers.
"Along the way, he has always been a beacon of light for his family, too, because he always tried to uplift them, tried to bring them out of their predicaments. Some of it worked out, some of it failed, but he never, ever turned his back on them," Franks said. "Everything he's done and built for York, he tried to do for his own family."
Franks-Govans had been a nurse in the military, and service to country was a path she encouraged for both Walker and her son.
"She gave me direction and purpose," Walker said. "You go through this turbulent life, so you have to make decisions. I made a decision to go into the military."
Before entering in the Army, though, he needed to connect to a broken relationship in his life.
Father figure At 18, Walker sought out his dad, a man who hadn't been around through his childhood.
He found that he couldn't relate to him. His father had never learned to read and hadn't seen much of the world. Conversations were stale, he said.
The father figure in his life was Morris Gandy, one of Walker's stepfathers, a Vietnam veteran.
"He was so proud of me as a stepdad," he said. "I didn't have a father there, but I had someone who I could talk to."
Walker's mother died in 1998, shot in her apartment in Philadelphia, still an unsolved murder, while Walker was in Germany with the Army. But Gandy threw a protective wing over all the children in his life until he died.
Years later, Walker named his business after him, Gandy Real Estate.
Walker and his half-brother, Dale Roane, had been very close growing up, but the shadow of their mother's life moved over Roane. He became a drug addict as well.
"As kids growing up, we were very, very close," Walker said.
When Roane got out of jail in 2018, Walker tried to help him by calling in a favor. Walker was on the board of directors with a recovery center and paid his brother's way.
Roane never showed up. Then, he went missing.
"I would hear stories about him being a panhandler," he said. They all tried to find him, but it was fruitless.
He died last year as a homeless drug addict in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, described by the New York Times as "the epicenter of Philadelphia's opioid crisis."
Walker had buried many family members, but this was different.
"It was a shocking moment of my life, to see my brother in that space, remembering all those moments that me and him had," Walker said. "The decisions in a person's life can end up in this manner."
After 10 years in the Army, Walker taught college classes in Washington, D.C., but it was an expensive place to live. He thought he could "live like a king" if he moved north, so he did.
The home he chose was near Mount Wolf. The boy who was homeless at times in his life had found a place where he could see the Susquehanna River from his back door. Now 44, he has lived there about 15 years with his two daughters, 19 and 17, and his wife, Janique Washington-Walker, assistant executive director of the Children's Aid Society.
In York, he plugged into the community by running a music store downtown and managing some entertainers, booking venues and traveling with them. While he still has a hand in that, he's focused on real estate now.
This week, he can be found at one of his properties, 30 Eberts Lane, where he is helping a tenant get his restaurant off the ground. Skillet2Plate Soul Bistro is expected to open this week under the ownership of Terence Days. Juan Cruz, formerly of the Left Bank, will be the chef.
It's the same place where Walker once took a troubled young man to show what hard work can create.
"You know who owns this? I own this entire block," Walker told him.
Among his many volunteer efforts, Walker is a leader with The Movement, a resource for city residents, connecting people in need with solutions. People write Facebook posts looking for housing - or even a prayer. Just recently, someone donated a truck to The Movement for residents to use for moving furniture.
"We're a helping hand up for people who are in difficult situations," Walker said.
He knows there are struggles behind every door. The rest of the world can't see other people's troubles, just like they hadn't seen his.
But that childhood - now decades ago - doesn't leave a person's soul. He still has fears.
He said: "Those things haunt me to this day: not having, being broke and being homeless."
It drives him forward - along with all the people he takes under his wing.

Texto completo: Dan Glass believes that even in our worst moments, there are opportunities for positive things.
The Ephrata author has good reason for that belief. In 2015, he and his wife, Heather, were hiking outside Las Vegas when she slipped and tore her ACL. She was stuck on a particularly treacherous part of the hike, on jagged boulders with a significant drop nearby.
Thanks to the kindness of some well-prepared passersby, Heather was rescued from the scary spot and later fully recovered. Glass tells the story in an essay that appears in “Chicken Soup for the Soul: Believe in Miracles.” The book was published Feb. 4.
------------
DETAILS
“Chicken Soup for the Soul: Believe in Miracles.”
By Various Authors, featuring Dan Glass.
Published by Chicken Soup for the Soul.
352 pages ($11.96).
------------
The momentous hike was in Icebox Canyon, a Nevada trail known for its many shady spots and seasonal waterfalls. It’s considered a moderately difficult hike.
“She was in a spot where a normal person could walk up 10 feet and then down 12 feet over this boulder patch, but she couldn’t do it because she couldn’t put weight on her leg,” Glass says. “So I knew right away that I couldn’t get her out by myself.”
He grabbed the first person he saw: a tall, buff guy named Don. His occupation? Search-and-rescue instructor.
It gets better. Don’s wife, Theresa, was also able to help. She’s a registered nurse.
“He took charge,” Glass says. “He was really, really good. He was weeding out the people who couldn’t help, and tried to give everybody jobs. … My job was, go find the easier path to go down over all these rocks so we don’t have to go the hard way.”
The process took about five hours, Glass says. And through it all, Heather didn’t shed a tear.
“I was amazed by how she handled it,” Glass says.
Glass, 48, is a West Lawn, Berks County, native. He was stationed in England while serving with the Air Force as a young man. When he returned home in 1996, he enrolled at Reading Area Community College.
Two years later, during a summer trip across the country, he realized his calling was to be an English teacher. He did that for over a decade at the high school and college levels before transitioning to his current role as an adviser at RACC. He has lived in Ephrata since 2008.
His writing has taken many forms over his life, from poetry to science fiction, and his most recent focus is sharing his personal experience living with Parkinson’s disease for the website Health Union.
Glass was diagnosed in 2016. He has Stage 2, meaning he experiences tremors on both sides.
“I woke up the next day, and I told my wife, if this is what it is, I’m going to spend my life and I’m going to educate and advocate for this,” Glass says. “And I’ve followed through with that ever since.”
Glass’ next goal is to be published in the long-running New York Times “Modern Love” essay series.
As for the “Chicken Soup” piece, he hopes the story of his wife’s rescue leaves the reader feeling positive.
“I want people to believe that something good exists out there,” Glass says. “And sometimes when you’re not looking for it, sometimes you find it.”

With Bernie Sanders as nominee, Democrats face tough task of running against capitalism

Texto completo: In an otherwise disastrous debate performance ahead of Saturday’s Nevada caucuses, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg did make one solid point directed at Bernie Sanders: “What a wonderful country we have. The best-known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses.”
By giving him a victory in Nevada to go along with his win in New Hampshire and arguable triumph in Iowa, Democrats have put Sanders in a commanding position to be their party’s nominee as the race heads to South Carolina and then beyond. Sanders is the only candidate who has all of the attributes typical of a major party nominee: early state performance, money, organization, and national polling.
Though the fractured field and the Democrats’ system for splitting up delegates may make it difficult for him to amass an outright majority ahead of the July convention, Sanders is now in the strongest position to win the most delegates and states. Given how rabid his supporters are and how they still feel jilted from losing the nomination in 2016 (when Hillary Clinton had won a delegate majority), there is no way the Democrats can risk taking Sanders down on the convention floor should he arrive in Milwaukee with the most support.
So after Nevada, Democrats are now one step closer to having an avowed socialist at the top of their ticket. At a time when unemployment is at a 50-year low, they’ll be running against a capitalist system that is responsible for spreading more freedom, ending more hunger, and lifting more people out of poverty than any other system in world history.
If the time is ripe for Sanders’s socialist revolution, most American voters don’t know it yet. Contrary to his claim that vast swaths of workers aren’t “making a nickel more than they did 45 years ago,” people in the United States currently have record-high confidence in their personal finances, with nearly twice the same number of Gallup poll participants reporting that they’re better off financially now than they were a year ago than they did in 1977.
But it’s not just perceptions that have improved. Capitalism has elevated the American quality of life across the board. When accounting for personal consumption expenditures while adjusting for inflation, economists have found that the median worker has seen a 38% increase in real wages since 1970, with women nearly doubling their earnings. And Sanders and his ilk ought not to mourn the shrinking of the middle class, as it’s only because more than double the percentage of people earn more than $100,000 than they did in 1977, and 8% fewer earn less than $35,000, both adjusted for inflation.
Capitalism has incurred even greater gains on a global scale.
Although two-thirds of people in the U.S. believe global poverty is on the rise, extreme global poverty has plummeted, not just as a percentage of the world’s population, but in absolute terms. Two centuries ago, 94% of the planet lived on the equivalent of less than $2 per day. Today, fewer than 10% do. Less than half a century ago, two-thirds of the world’s population survived with fewer than $5.50 per day. Today, less than half do. And from 1990 to 2015, the absolute number of people living on under $1.90 per day fell by more than 1 billion.
Significant recent gains came almost entirely from free trade liberating capital in East Asia, where the poverty rate fell from 58.8% to 1.7% in about half a century. But even as the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty has stagnated in sub-Saharan Africa, that's only due to population growth: The percentage of the population living in extreme poverty has declined from 55% in 1990 to 41% in 2015.
“I wrote a best-selling book,” Sanders told the New York Times when asked about how he made so much money after his 2016 campaign. “If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.”
So great are the blessings of capitalism that it enabled Sanders to join the ranks of the top 1% by having established himself as the country’s most famous socialist. Yet now, he wants to become president so he can tear that system down.

John Ratcliffe: Adam Schiff is Russia's best asset in sowing election discord

Texto completo: No one has played into the Kremlin’s hands more than Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, according to a key Republican congressman.
Rep. John Ratcliffe, a former federal prosecutor and member of the intelligence panel, addressed disputed leaks about classified intelligence on Russian inference in the 2020 election.
“He's at it again by putting out, through his committee, information that is false,” the Texas lawmaker told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures. “Look, I'm not trying to be hyperbolic here, but I don't know anyone in the last three years who has done more to help Vladimir Putin and Russia with their efforts to sow the seeds of discord in American elections and American election security than Adam Schiff has.”

The controversial classified briefing happened earlier this month and was conducted by Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community election threats executive under then-Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. During the meeting, sources cited by the New York Times on Thursday claimed Pierson warned that “Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected.”

Ratcliffe said he could not provide specifics about “a classified briefing that was intended to remain secret,” but he did deny the accuracy of the reporting.
“We see when there's a story about — that is allegedly anti-Trump or negative for the president, it shows up in newspapers because either Democratic members or Democratic staffers leak it,” the Texas Republican said Sunday. “The problem is, in this case, they have leaked information that's not accurate.”
His comments echo denials made by a national security official cited by CNN’s Jake Tapper on Friday.
“What's been articulated in the news is that the intelligence community has concluded that the Russians are trying to help Trump again. But the intelligence doesn't say that,” Tapper’s source said. “The problem is Shelby said they developed a preference for Trump. A more reasonable interpretation of the intelligence is not that they have a preference; it's a step short of that.” The national security official added, “It's more that they understand the president is someone they can work with; he's a dealmaker. But not that they prefer him over” his Democratic opponents.
“So it may have been mischaracterized by Shelby,” the official said.

CNN reported Sunday that “one intelligence official said that Pierson's characterization of the intelligence was ‘misleading’ and a national security official said Pierson failed to provide the ‘nuance’ needed to accurately convey the U.S. intelligence conclusions.”

The Washington Post cited a source Thursday who claimed the briefing “was the catalyst” that led Trump to replace Maguire with U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell last week. But national security adviser Robert O’Brien said Trump did not make the personnel switch because of the briefing.
Still, Schiff seemed to embrace the hotly-disputed framing of the reports. When the New York Times published its story Thursday, Schiff tweeted in response: “We count on the intelligence community to inform Congress of any threat of foreign interference in our elections. If reports are true and the President is interfering with that, he is again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling.”

On Sunday, Trump disputed the claim that the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded Russia wanted him to win reelection in 2020.
“Nobody said it to me at all. Nobody briefed me about that all,” Trump said. “They leaked it, Adam Schiff and his group. They leaked it to the papers. And as usual, they ought to investigate Adam Schiff for leaking that information.”

Schiff called the comment a “nice deflection.”
“Your false claims fool no one,” the California Democrat tweeted. “You welcomed Russian help in 2016, tried to coerce Ukraine’s help in 2019, and won’t protect our elections in 2020. Now you fired your intel chief for briefing Congress about it. You’ve betrayed America. Again.”

CBS News's Catherine Herridge tweeted Friday her source “said briefers had none to offer” when pressed for details about whether there was signals intelligence, such as phone intercepts, to back up claims about Russia’s 2020 preference.
“I haven't seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to attempt to get President Trump reelected,” O’Brien said Sunday.

Ratcliffe, who was briefly Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence last year, said on Sunday the Russians “meddled in 2016” and “they're going to meddle in 2020.”
“That's not the issue: The issue is why Russia is being so successful in shaking American confidence in the integrity of our elections,” Ratcliffe argued. “And the reason is, it's because Democrats keep perpetuating and accentuating and proliferating Russian propaganda for their political gain and for their political motivation against Donald Trump.”
The congressman pointed to British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier being used in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to target Trump campaign associate Carter Page, as well as Schiff’s 2018 FISA memo, which defended the Page FISA process.
DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz identified at least 17 “significant errors or omissions” in the DOJ’s and the FBI’s use of FISA warrants in the Trump-Russia investigation. Schiff’s critics believe Horowitz’s FISA report demonstrated that Republican California Rep. Devin Nunes’s own 2018 FISA memo was almost entirely correct.
“All of these things have been done by Democrats for their political gain, but has promoted everything that Russia has tried to accomplish,” Ratcliffe claimed. “And the Democrats have been their biggest allies.”
Schiff said in December 2017 that there was “pretty damning” evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. And after special counsel Robert Mueller’s report was released in April, Schiff claimed there was “ample evidence of collusion in plain sight.”

Mueller’s report stated, “The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

FBI Director Christopher Wray testified earlier this month that Russia’s “efforts to sow discord on both sides of an issue” is “very much ongoing.”
Fiona Hill, the National Security Council’s former Russia expert and a Ukraine impeachment witness, testified last year that the Russians “seed misinformation” and “seed doubt.”

Texto completo: New York Times columnist Paul Krugman urged the Democratic establishment to drop its hostility toward Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and help make the avowed socialist more electable if he wins the party’s nomination.
Krugman said Democrats should be more concerned about Sanders’s electability than his policy proposals, arguing that it is the "job" of the party to make sure he appeals to general election voters.
“I’m more concerned about (a) the electability of someone who says he’s a socialist even though he isn’t and (b) if he does win, whether he’ll squander political capital on unwinnable fights like abolishing private health insurance. But if he’s the nominee, it’s the job of Dems to make him electable if at all possible,” he wrote Sunday.
Krugman’s piece marks a shift for some Democrats, who are adjusting to the prospect of a Sanders nomination after he won the New Hampshire primary and Nevada caucuses, putting him in a strong position heading into Super Tuesday when more than a third of delegates will be up for grabs.
Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said Sunday he was “not at all” worried about Sanders, who is not officially a member of the party, winning the nomination.
"He is certainly a polarizing candidate, but we have an incredibly polarizing person on the other side," Dean said of Sanders on CNN’s State of the Union, adding that the Vermont senator could could help the party turn out swing voters. "As I said before, he showed last night that he can energize our core base.”
“I've got news for the Republican establishment. I've got news for the Democratic establishment. They can't stop us,” Sanders tweeted ahead of his Nevada victory.

Joe Biden's malarkey problem

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden’s penchant for misstating the facts is so severe his opponents often question his mental acuity.

But they may want to consider the possibility that he is merely dishonest.

Biden told an audience at a recent campaign event in South Carolina that he was arrested decades ago in South Africa for attempting to meet with then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela.

“This day, 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid,” the former vice president said. “I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto, trying to get to see him on Robbens Island.”

Biden has told this story at least three times this month, including a version that pegs the year of his alleged arrest at around the time he proposed to his wife in 1977.

There is only one problem with the former vice president’s story: No one seems to have any idea what he is talking about, least of all the aforementioned U.N. ambassador, Andrew Young, who told the New York Times, “I was never arrested and I don’t think he was, either.”

The Times scoured for evidence of the supposed Soweto incident. It came up empty-handed, which is astonishing considering Biden was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1973, four years prior to his alleged arrest in South Africa. It should not be difficult to find evidence of a member of the U.S. Congress being forcibly detained in a foreign country during an overseas trip in the late 1970s. Also, there is the fact that Soweto is roughly 900 miles away from Robbens Island.

The Biden campaign declined to respond to five separate requests for comment from the Times, which obviously does not bode well for the credibility of the anecdote.

This is not the first time that the former vice president has told a story on the 2020 campaign trail that is almost certainly a load of malarkey.

In August 2019, Biden claimed a four-star general asked him when he was vice president to visit the Konar province in Afghanistan to personally recognize a Navy captain's heroism. Biden claimed the captain initially refused the Silver Star, saying he did not think he deserved it.

"He said, 'Sir, I don't want the damn thing!'" the 2020 candidate told a crowd in New Hampshire. "'Do not pin it on me, sir! Please, sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!'"

Biden got the year, the location, the heroism, the type of medal, the military branch, and the recipient's rank wrong. The anecdote, though loosely based on real-life events, never happened the way Biden told it. Or, as the Washington Post puts it, Biden seems to have “jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery, compassion and regret that never happened.”

Is it a false memory? Is it intentional dishonesty? Who knows!

All we know is that there is much more where this sort of thing comes from, including when Biden claimed last year that the survivors of the Parkland shooting “came up to see me when I was vice president." The Parkland shooting was in 2018. Biden left the White House in 2016.

The most alarming thing about the former vice president's dubious claims is that they are not minor “misspeaks” of verbal flubs, such as when he said, “Poor kids are just as bright, just as talented, as white kids.” Biden's claims about pinning medals and getting arrested in South Africa are statements of fact. They are about historical events he claims to have experienced, and they may or may not be complete fabrications.

There is also the smaller problem of Biden being just plain wrong on basic facts. This genre of falsehood is not as troubling as his apparently invented anecdotes, but it is no less disturbing for its factual inaccuracies.

Biden claimed last fall that “Bobby Kennedy and Dr. King” were “assassinated in the ’70s, the late ’70s when I got engaged.” King and Kennedy were both killed in 1968. Biden claimed his late son, Beau, served as "Attorney General of the United States." Beau Biden was the attorney general of Delaware. The former vice president claimed 40 people were killed in the 1970 Kent State shooting. Four students were killed. Biden claimed the 2019 El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, mass-shootings happened in "Houston" and "Michigan." He once referred to the Second Amendment as the First. Biden repeatedly confuses the cities and states in which he is speaking. The list goes on.

These and other false claims, including Biden’s tales from Afghanistan and meeting with Parkland students, happen with enough regularity that one is left to wonder whether it is mere sloppiness or intentional dishonesty. Perhaps, as the former vice president’s opponents suggest, it is an issue of mental acuity. Then again, perhaps Biden simply struggles to tell the truth.

Michael Milken deserved Trump's pardon

Texto completo: President Trump has taken some criticisms for the pardons he recently issued, so let’s take a look at one of them: Michael Milken. In 1990, Milken pleaded guilty to a technical securities offense, for which he was pardoned on Tuesday. Milken was an outsider who took on a cozy establishment, beat them at their own game, and then was chewed up and spit out by a shameful criminal law system. His pardon was well-deserved.
Milken came from a humble background. As a nerdy Jewish teenager, he attended a public high school in Encino, California, and his rise was a great example of the American Dream. He wasn’t a member of the club, but he got a job at the white-shoe, Philadelphia-based Drexel Burnham Lambert investment firm, where he was quickly recognized as a whiz.
He ran his operations through a Wilshire Boulevard office in Beverly Hills, California, run as a quasi-independent firm. He’d arrive at work at 4:00 a.m. to be ready for the New York markets when they opened at 6:00 a.m. Pacific time and simply beat the competition in picking undervalued companies. Back east, investment bankers focused on a firm’s historical earnings and physical assets and ignored better predictors of future earnings, such as the quality of management and prospects for growth, things Milken saw as more important. As his reputation for picking winners grew, Milken attracted some of the wealthiest venture capitalists as clients, people such as T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn, and Drexel became known as a firm that could raise billions of dollars to finance a takeover of a company within a matter of hours.
Soon, the Beverley Hills office was the tail wagging the Philadelphia dog.
None of this won him any friends back east, however — not on Wall Street, in the legal academy, or on the Securities and Exchange Commission. The high-yield securities he was pushing were junk bonds, and worse still, he wasn’t sharing his profits with Wall Street underwriters. There had been a tradition that lead underwriters on a deal would pass on part of the securities to be sold to other underwriters, but Milken wasn’t having any of that. Drexel found it could raise billions of dollars to finance a takeover all by itself, and it did just that.
None of this went down well with the country’s opinion leaders: Time, the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, and other establishment journals. Milken’s junk bonds were portrayed as a plague that every decent person should condemn. What Milken was really doing was helping to break up the oversized fat-cat corporate behemoths. They had wastefully sat on piles of money, and splitting them apart released billions of dollars into the economy. As such, Milken was an important contributor to the economic recovery during the Reagan years.
It’s easy enough to ignore the New York Review of Books. It’s harder for a businessman to ignore populist criminal law and grandstanding, politically ambitious prosecutors such as Rudy Giuliani. Milken had revitalized the country’s economy, but for his pains was fined $600 million, sentenced to 10 years (later reduced to two) in prison, and required to perform three years of community service.
The state had used all the pressure at its command to force Milken to plead guilty to victimless offenses that had previously not been thought criminal. Prosecutors changed the rules in the middle of the game and radically expanded the scope of the criminal law to include harmless practices. It offered very lenient plea bargains to notorious liars such as Ivan Boesky (“greed is healthy”) in exchange for their promises to implicate Milken. Further, it threatened to prosecute Milken’s brother and sent FBI agents to visit his 93-year-old grandfather, using them as bargaining chips to get Milken to plead guilty. The state also waved the prospect of a Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations order at Drexel, securing a guilty plea from it as well as the firm’s cooperation in the prosecution’s pursuit of Milken.
Since his release from prison, Milken has led an exemplary life and is a huge philanthropist, and that alone would merit a pardon. His foundation tackles medical illnesses, especially prostate cancer, from which he suffers. But simply as an innovator who took on a financial establishment, helped turn our economy around, and was unfairly prosecuted for his efforts, Milken deserved the pardon.

Texto completo: Back during the scandal over his sexual exploitation of a young intern, Bill Clinton was pilloried in this space for his moral defects.
To which many liberals responded with derision. Morality? What did that matter? The economy was good, we were at peace and Clinton was hardly the first man to fool around and lie about it. As one reader put it, he was hired to be a president, not a pope.
At the time, that felt like a rationalization. A generation later, it feels like a portent. Indeed, it is often said that we are living now in Post-Fact America but truth is, we are also living in Post-Integrity America.
No, that's not breaking news. But it's been brought into painfully clear focus these last few days.
One watched — not with surprise anymore, the capacity for that being long lost, but surely with dread and fascination — as Donald Trump launched his post-impeachment purge of aides deemed insufficiently sycophantic. But that was just a prelude.
Last week, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 people, most of them guilty of lying, fraud, corruption, tax evasion and similar crimes. In other words, the kinds of things of which Trump has often been accused.
The power to soften or wipe away criminal convictions is one of the nicer perks of the presidency, allowing compassion to be shown to those who deserve it. And in fairness, several of those who benefited last week seem to meet that standard. Crystal Munoz, for instance, had been sentenced to almost 20 years for dealing pot.
But it is worth noting that every person Trump pardoned or gave clemency came to his attention not through the normal machinery of government, but through inside connections or else, as The New York Times noted, "were promoted on Fox News." Some were championed by aides and allies. Some had donated big money to his campaign. And again, most had breached the public trust.
Like former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who had served eight years of a 14-year sentence for trying to sell Barack Obama’s vacated Senate seat. Trump, who has opined how unfair it is that U.S. companies are not allowed to pay bribes to do business overseas, had called that sentence “ridiculous.”
It’s no great leap to suggest that he sees himself in Blagojevich. Or in former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and financier Michael Milken, whom he pardoned for tax fraud and securities fraud, respectively. If granting clemency and pardons opens a window upon a president’s moral priorities — and it does — the view offered here suggests an unfortunate affinity for scammers and grifters, an empathy for those on the make, cutting deals, cutting corners, living the dream, until they got caught up by pesky rules designed to enforce integrity. And if those same people happened to give him money or had their names whispered into his ear by a friend, so much the better.
That's not how this is supposed to work. And that it is working this way right out in the open, before our very eyes, suggests — no, screams — Trump's imperviousness to any sense of ethical affront.
During Clinton's scandal, it was argued in this space that a president stamps himself upon an era "not simply by legislative accomplishment, but also ... by dint of personal authority and moral suasion."
Trump disproves that. He has stamped himself upon this era while ignoring the very idea of personal authority or moral suasion — and daring us to care. But we had better. By his lack of personal character, Trump threatens our national character. And he stamps this era with the signature lesson of his life:
Once you give up integrity, it's easy to give up everything else.

Texto completo: Several years ago, in an overheated room in Beijing, I was forced to endure a stern lecture from a Chinese foreign ministry official. My sin: As the editor at The Wall Street Journal responsible for the paper’s overseas opinion sections, I had apparently insulted the entire Chinese people by publishing the work of a “well-known terrorist” — courageous Uighur human-rights activist Rebiya Kadeer.
I had to clench my jaw to suppress the rejoinder that China’s best-known tyrant, Mao Zedong, has his portrait overlooking the killing field known as Tiananmen Square.
I thought of that episode this week on hearing Wednesday’s news that the Chinese government has decided to expel three Wall Street Journal reporters based in China — two Americans and an Australian — in retaliation for the headline of an opinion column by Walter Russell Mead, “China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia.” In a style reminiscent of my own experience, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement claiming, “The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and smear China with malicious attacks.”
Any reader of Mead’s column, headline and text alike, will note that there isn’t an iota of racism in it, though it makes a devastating case about the ways in which the coronavirus epidemic has exposed the broader fragility of the Chinese system. And those familiar with The Wall Street Journal will know that the paper, like The New York Times, enforces a strict separation between its news and opinion sections — meaning the reporters facing expulsion had absolutely nothing to do with the writing and publication of Mead’s column.
But factual accuracy is irrelevant in a political scapegoating exercise, which is what this strike on the Journal is all about. And this does more to underscore Mead’s broader point about China’s inherent weaknesses than it does to contradict it.
What are those weaknesses? Demographers point to China’s falling birthrate, aging population and gender gap. Economists cite its faltering productivity, its made-up statistics and its giant debt bomb. And political analysts point to ever more repressive policies from Beijing, leading to ever greater discontent from Hong Kong to Xinjiang.
But the coronavirus crisis has exposed a far-deeper weakness: The Chinese regime fears information.
It was just this fear that, as my colleague Nick Kristof pointed out, led the government to suppress news about the new virus — and punish whistleblowing doctors — when it should have done the opposite, swiftly, so as to better contain its spread. The result was the loss of the critical time in fighting the virus, all but guaranteeing the global health crisis that followed.
This sort of behavior is nothing new for the Chinese government: It mishandled the 2003 SARS epidemic in much the same way. Nor is the problem specific to China: Any regime that depends on the manipulation or manufacture of “truth” for its own survival is bound to act in similar ways. That’s one of the reasons Donald Trump’s nonstop lying and misstatements of fact aren’t just immoral but also dangerous. Truth driven underground doesn’t vanish. It stalks.
But the problem for the Chinese is much more acute, for the simple reason that they don’t have genuinely independent domestic journalism. That means that ordinary people have no access to timely, accurate and comprehensive information — and neither do China’s rulers. The result is rumor, which can be dangerous; ignorance, which can be fatal; and miscalculation, which can be catastrophic.
The move against The Wall Street Journal will compound the regime’s problems, since reporting by foreign news organizations has often been critical in filling the omissions and straightening the distortions of China’s official media. It was The Journal that did some of the most pathbreaking work to expose the scale of the country’s environmental catastrophes, just as it was The Times that exposed the extent of graft at the top of the Chinese leadership pyramid. Other news outlets, particularly Reuters, have done vital reporting on the frauds and scams endemic in China’s economy.
Suppress this kind of reporting, and the first people who will suffer information blindness are China’s leaders. Every dictator needs subscriptions to The Journal and The Times, even if they come — like smutty magazines of yore — in inconspicuous brown envelopes.
It’s always possible that the regime will think better of its move to expel the reporters or at least quietly let them return in a few weeks’ time. Wise leaders, facing a monumental crisis brought on by their own irrational distrust of information, would at least learn the lessons of their folly. But there might be a truth in China even more frightening than the coronavirus — foolish rulers.
For that, no vaccine has ever been invented.

Texto completo: I’ll let you in on a little secret about media coverage of prime-time political debates: What happens in the first half, even the first quarter, gets much more attention than what happens as the night drags on.
We all have deadlines bearing down on us and must produce our stories immediately after the debate’s end, so we start formulating thoughts and fashioning sentences before then. If there are fireworks early in the event, we say a cheer of gratitude and let them light up our commentary. So it was with Mike Bloomberg’s miserable performance in Las Vegas. He established his awfulness right off the bat. We ran with it. I know I did.
But in the case of this debate, what happened at the bitter end was probably most meaningful. All six candidates onstage were asked to envision a situation — utterly plausible this year — in which none of them went into the Democratic convention in Milwaukee in July with a majority of pledged delegates and, therefore, an unequivocal claim to the nomination. Should the politician with a plurality of delegates be the nominee?
Only Bernie Sanders, who currently has the best shot at being that person, said yes. The others said no. That would mean a brokered convention, in which the votes of uncommitted “superdelegates” or alliances formed among certain candidates are necessary to put someone over the top. And it would be a nightmare scenario for the Democratic Party, which is deep into a bad dream already, because it would invite further cynicism, second-guessing, cries of illegitimacy and irresolution in a country that’s paralyzed by all of that.
Something unsettling is going on in American politics — in America, period — and the chaotic Democratic race exemplifies it. The rules are all blurry. The processes are all suspect. Or at least they’re seen that way, so more and more judgments are up for debate and more and more defeats are prone to dispute. President Donald Trump is a prime player in this, but it didn’t start with him and isn’t confined to him. He’s exploiting and accelerating a crisis of faith in traditions and institutions, not causing it. He’s improvising, and he’s hardly alone.
Everywhere I look: incipient or latent pandemonium. The Iowa caucuses were a mess that motivated some candidates to press self-aggrandizing grievances, and there are concerns that the Nevada caucuses are headed for the same fate. Bloomberg’s rivals argue (understandably) that he’s using his billions to game the system and pervert the whole shebang. And in a reprise of four years ago, Sanders’ supporters fume that the media, the Democratic National Committee and other supposed pillars of the establishment are conspiring against him in some underhanded, corrupt way. I’m no soothsayer, but I foresee intensifying quarrels over whether whoever is leading the field deserves to be in that position and whether his or her competitors got a raw deal.
It’s 2016 all over again, except maybe worse. Back then both Sanders and Trump, who was braced to lose, insisted that the process was rigged. Sanders’ supporters questioned the legitimacy of Hillary Clinton’s victory in the Democratic primary before Clinton’s supporters questioned the legitimacy of Trump’s victory in the general election. There were good reasons all around, but it was striking nonetheless how fervently the disappointed rejected the denouement.
It was also corrosive. I’m not recommending a pliant surrender to injustice, but I see more value in plotting carefully for the next fight than in raging boundlessly over the last one. At some point, doesn’t everyone have to move on?
Not anymore. In Washington, there’s the prospect of impeachment beyond impeachment, of new hearings to supplement the old ones, of additional evidence that will spiritually nullify the president’s ludicrous acquittal by the Senate. John Bolton continues his national-security version of a striptease; he’s both a man of — and a metaphor for — an era in which nothing finishes, everything festers and all can be revisited and revised. Bill Barr junks sentence recommendations. Trump commutes sentences. There are investigations into investigators. Cries of cheating and fraudulence fly in every direction.
I blame the internet, because I like to and because it’s true. I mean that I blame the way it encourages people to choose their own information and curate their own reality, so that no official pronouncement competes with a pet theory. I blame a national epidemic of selfishness, too. It seems to me that fewer and fewer people are easily moved off their particular worries, their special wants. Any outcome that displeases them is ipso facto a bastardized one.
“The refusal to grant victors legitimacy bundles together so much about America today: the coarseness of our discourse; the blind tribalism coloring our debates; the elevation of individualism far above common purpose; the ethos that everybody should and can feel like a winner on every day,” I wrote during the last presidential election, and I wondered then if this were a passing phase.
Nope. It’s the context — aggravated if anything — for the current race for the Democratic nomination, which features a scrum of sharp-elbowed aspirants, room galore for recriminations and the very, very real possibility of a brokered convention.
Imagine that Sanders — with a plurality but not a majority of delegates — loses the nomination that way. He and many of his supporters would probably say that Democratic voters had been betrayed, and they wouldn’t be wrong. They could be furious enough to abandon the party’s pick, to the advantage of Trump.
Now imagine the opposite: Although Sanders lacks a majority, Democrats who aren’t on his train feel too intimidated not to ride it, and so rules and dynamics set up expressly to make sure that the nominee represents as close to a party consensus as possible aren’t properly applied. His nomination would be deemed unjust in some quarters, straining party unity.
What would salvage either set of circumstances is the acceptance and acknowledgment by Democrats who don’t get what they want that perpetually sore feelings serve little purpose. But that perspective — that maturity — is in retreat.
We certainly can’t expect it from Trump if (please oh please) he’s defeated in November. He’ll manufacture any and every argument to say that he was robbed. And in a country in which the messy guts of our institutions are increasingly conspicuous and the merchants of cynicism grow ever bolder, he’ll find takers aplenty.
After all, getting worked up is so much less tedious than getting along.

Texto completo: When it comes to religion, I am neither here, nor ... religious. I was raised in the predominant religion of our region, but have since left to find my own way.
My former husband is still a member, and I have supported our two boys in whatever religion they choose.
My younger son, who is autistic, as many of you know, recently got the priesthood. I was there when he served the sacrament for the first time. He was doing OK until he got to the back of the congregation. That’s when he got a little confused and lost track of his tray. I watched him as he threw his hands up, glanced around, then threw his hands up again, muttering, “What the—. What the—.” It was as if the tray, in his mind, had just vanished into thin air.
The next week he served the sacrament, he dropped off the tray at one end of the row, and then said loudly, “You have until the count of five and then I’m leaving.”
Don’t get me wrong. The kid loves serving the sacrament. In fact, he loves anything that comes with an age requirement. At 12, you serve the sacrament. At 16, you get your license. At 18 you are an adult.
But he also loves his own interests. Autism comes with a host of issues, both good and difficult. He can tell you what day your birthday will fall on, for any given year, but mostly he will tell you about cats, because cats are what he’s interested in right now.
Over a year ago (on Nov. 19, 2018, to be exact) I randomly mentioned to him that I’d seen a news story that scientists are working on a cure for peanut allergies.
He is allergic to peanuts. Little did I realize what this casual aside would mean to him.
Since then, he has tracked the scientists, tracked the stories, studied the FDA and talked about it to everyone from his aunts and uncles to the woman who works at 7-Eleven. (The other day, I picked him up from 7-Eleven, and the woman said he had lined up all of the Reese’s peanut butter products in order of which ones he would eat first when the cure came.)
Getting him to open up isn’t hard. But we have to make efforts to get him to take an interest in other people. Empathy often doesn’t come naturally in autistic kids.
“Say goodbye back,” we say.
“They asked you a question, ask one back,” we say.
“Remember it’s Tuesday, and Tuesday is the day we don’t talk to everyone about cats,” we say.
My father passed away from cancer eight years ago. My mother is a cancer survivor. The other day, my kid sent me a link to an article about a company that guaranteed a cure for cancer in a year. (Of course I hope it’s true, but I don’t believe it.)
Then he called me.
Him: “Did you get my text?”
Me: “Yes. Why did you send it?”
Him: “Because I knew that your dad had cancer and your mom had cancer and you were interested in cancer. So I Googled ‘cancer,’ but I didn’t like what I saw. So I Googled ‘cure for cancer’ and I found this.”
At this point my breath caught. He had done this not out of self-interest, but out of empathy. Empathy that wasn’t forced upon him. Empathy that wasn’t a reminder or an assignment.
Him: “If you were having a bad day, and I sent this to you, would it make you happy?”
Me: “Well, actually I was having a bad day because I burned my arm.” (It was a grease burn and it hurt like a... well, that’s a story for another column.)
Him: “So this made you happy?”
Me: “Yes. So happy.”
Him: “Read it and then text me your thoughts.”
Little does he know that I don’t think I’ll ever be able to put my thoughts about this particular act into words. Words aren’t adequate.

Leonard Pitts: Living in post-integrity America

Texto completo: Back during the scandal over his sexual exploitation of a young intern, Bill Clinton was pilloried in this space for his moral defects.
To which many liberals responded with derision. Morality? What did that matter? The economy was good, we were at peace and Clinton was hardly the first man to fool around and lie about it. As one reader put it, he was hired to be a president, not a pope.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-3835774" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/PITTS_LEONARD_2_TNS-249x300.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="300" />
At the time, that felt like a rationalization. A generation later, it feels like a portent. Indeed, it is often said that we are living now in Post-Fact America but truth is, we are also living in Post-Integrity America.
No, that’s not breaking news. But it’s been brought into painfully clear focus these last few days.
One watched — not with surprise anymore, the capacity for that being long lost, but surely with dread and fascination — as Donald Trump launched his post-impeachment purge of aides deemed insufficiently sycophantic. But that was just a prelude.
Last week, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 people, most of them guilty of lying, fraud, corruption, tax evasion and similar crimes. In other words, the kinds of things of which Trump has often been accused.
The power to soften or wipe away criminal convictions is one of the nicer perks of the presidency, allowing compassion to be shown to those who deserve it. And in fairness, several of those who benefited last week seem to meet that standard. Crystal Munoz, for instance, had been sentenced to almost 20 years for dealing pot.
But it is worth noting that every person Trump pardoned or gave clemency came to his attention not through the normal machinery of government, but through inside connections or else, as The New York Times noted, “were promoted on Fox News.” Some were championed by aides and allies. Some had donated big money to his campaign. And again, most had breached the public trust.
Like former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who had served eight years of a 14-year sentence for trying to sell Barack Obama’s vacated Senate seat. Trump, who has opined how unfair it is that U.S. companies are not allowed to pay bribes to do business overseas, had called that sentence “ridiculous.”
It’s no great leap to suggest that he sees himself in Blagojevich. Or in former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and financier Michael Milken, whom he pardoned for tax fraud and securities fraud, respectively. If granting clemency and pardons opens a window upon a president’s moral priorities — and it does — the view offered here suggests an unfortunate affinity for scammers and grifters, an empathy for those on the make, cutting deals, cutting corners, living the dream, until they got caught up by pesky rules designed to enforce integrity. And if those same people happened to give him money or had their names whispered into his ear by a friend, so much the better.
That’s not how this is supposed to work. And that it is working this way right out in the open, before our very eyes, suggests — no, screams — Trump’s imperviousness to any sense of ethical affront.
During Clinton’s scandal, it was argued in this space that a president stamps himself upon an era “not simply by legislative accomplishment, but also … by dint of personal authority and moral suasion.”
Trump disproves that. He has stamped himself upon this era while ignoring the very idea of personal authority or moral suasion — and daring us to care. But we had better. By his lack of personal character, Trump threatens our national character. And he stamps this era with the signature lesson of his life:
Once you give up integrity, it’s easy to give up everything else.

Krugman: Warren, Bloomberg and what really matters

Texto completo: Wednesday’s Democratic debate was far more informative than previous debates. What we learned, in particular, was that as a presidential candidate, Michael Bloomberg is a great businessman — and that Elizabeth Warren remains a force to be reckoned with.
Both lessons ran very much counter to the narrative that the news media has been telling in recent weeks. On one side, there has been a palpable eagerness on the part of some news organizations and many pundits to elevate Bloomberg; on the other side, complaints by Warren supporters about her “erasure” from news coverage and polling aren’t wrong.
What does all this mean for the nomination? I have no idea. But maybe the Warren-Bloomberg confrontation will help refocus discussion away from so-called “Medicare for All” — which isn’t going to be enacted, no matter who wins — to an issue where it matters a lot which Democrat prevails. Namely, are we going to do anything to rein in the financialization of the U.S. economy?
During the U.S. economy’s greatest generation — the era of rapid, broadly shared growth that followed World War II — Wall Street was a fairly peripheral part of the picture. When people thought about business leaders, they thought about people running companies that actually made things, not people who got rich through wheeling and dealing.
But that all changed in the 1980s, largely thanks to financial deregulation. Suddenly the big bucks came from buying and selling companies as opposed to running them.
In many cases, these financial deals saddled companies with crippling levels of debt, often ending in bankruptcy and job destruction — a process that continues to this day. There was also an epidemic of financial fraud and racketeering, exemplified by the career of Michael Milken, the junk-bond king Donald Trump just pardoned.
And the financial sector itself doubled as a share of the economy, which meant that it was pulling lots of capital and many smart people away from productive activities.
For there is no evidence that Wall Street’s mega-expansion made the rest of the economy more efficient. On the contrary, growth in family incomes slowed down as finance rose — although a few people became immensely rich. And the runaway growth of finance set the stage for the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
It also made Michael Bloomberg a billionaire.
Now, I wasn’t being sarcastic in calling Bloomberg a great businessman. He is. And to his credit, he himself hasn’t, as far as I know, engaged in destructive financial wheeling and dealing. Instead, he got rich by selling equipment to destructive wheeler-dealers.
For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, I’m referring to the famous Bloomberg terminal, a proprietary computer system that gives subscribers real-time access to large quantities of financial data. This access is incredibly expensive — a subscription costs around $24,000 a year. But it’s a must-have in the financial industry, because traders with Bloomberg terminals can react to market events a few minutes faster than those without.
It’s an extremely profitable business. But is it good for the economy? No.
After all, does getting financial information a few minutes earlier do anything significant to improve real-world business decisions that affect jobs and productivity? Surely not. Bloomberg has, in effect, made his billions off a financial arms race that costs vast sums but leaves everyone pretty much back where they started.
Which brings me to Elizabeth Warren.
Warren stumbled badly, making herself a long shot for the nomination, by trying to appease supporters of Bernie Sanders. She endorsed proposals for radical health care reform that have almost no chance of becoming reality, and she was raked over the coals about paying for those proposals even though Sanders himself has offered few clues about his own plans.
But before all that, Warren had made a name for herself as a crusader against financial industry fraud and excess.
It wasn’t just talk. One key piece of the reforms instituted after the 2008 financial crisis, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was Warren’s brainchild. Furthermore, by all accounts the bureau was wildly successful, saving ordinary families billions, until the Trump administration set about eviscerating it.
And here’s the thing: Financial reform, unlike health care, is an area in which it might make a big difference which Democrat becomes president. It’s true that other candidates — including Bloomberg! — have endorsed Warren-type reforms. But it is, I think, fair to ask how committed they would be in practice, and also whether they would squander their political capital on unwinnable fights, which is my big concern about Sanders.
Again, aside from the clear damage to Bloomberg, I have no idea how or if Wednesday’s debate will affect the Democratic race. But it may have helped remind Democrats that corruption, fraud and the excesses of Wall Street in particular can be potent political issues — especially against a president who is both personally corrupt and so obviously a friend to fraudsters.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden said Sunday that Russians have worked to block him from winning the Democratic nomination while favoring Sen. Bernie Sanders, though he admitted his claims were not based on anything he had been told by intelligence officials.
"The Russians don't want me to be the nominee," Biden said on CBS News' "Face the Nation," later adding, "they like Bernie. "
Biden made the comment after being asked about Sanders' momentum in the Democratic primary race to determine who will take on President Donald Trump in November.
After leading in virtually every poll on the national race for his party's nomination for most of 2019, Biden has fallen behind Sanders in most recent polls. And Sanders has won two of the first three primary contests, while Biden has yet to win a state and performed below expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire.

When asked if he could stop Sanders, Biden insisted he was still "the best guy to beat Trump" before claiming the Russians were working against him.
"They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook and they've been taken down saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running," Biden said of the Russians. "No one's helping me to try to get the nomination. "
On Friday, The Washington Post first reported that U. S. intelligence officials told Sanders that Russian President Vladimir Putin was interfering in the Democratic primary race and was trying to help his campaign. The Post report did not specify how the Russians were trying to accomplish that goal. But former special counsel Robert Mueller's report on 2016 election interference said Russian intelligence agents used social media as a major part of their effort.
"I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do," Sanders said in response to the report. He acknowledged he was told in an intelligence briefing "about a month ago" about Russia's latest meddling, though he said, "It was not clear what role they were going to play. "
Biden called for the other campaigns to be given the same information.
"I have not spoken to the intelligence community, but I think the intelligence community should inform the rest of us who are running what they told Sen. Sanders," he said.
When pressed about his claim that Russians had used bots on Facebook to attack him, Biden said he had been told by a campaign staffer that was what had occurred.
"All I know is what I've read and has been reported. Not one has confided in me. I have no inside information," Biden said.

Sanders also suggested that his supporters who have been accused of inappropriate and aggressive behavior online, often referred to as Bernie Bros, could be part of Russian "internet propaganda to sow division in our country. "
"Some of the ugly stuff on the internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters," Sanders said.
Biden appeared unconvinced.
"Well, look, the people that occupied my office, maybe they were Russians. I don't know," Biden said, referring to Sanders supporters who were arrested in January for refusing to leave Biden's Des Moines campaign headquarters. Citing that incident and attacks on the Culinary Workers Union after it didn't endorse Sanders, Biden accused the Vermont senator's supporters of engaging in "Trump-like stuff. "
"This is not the stuff that we've done in Democratic primaries before," Biden said.
On Friday, The New York Times first reported that Shelby Pierson, an aide to former acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, told lawmakers in a Feb. 13 briefing that Russian interference also aimed to help Trump secure his reelection. The Times reported that Trump's anger about the briefing contributed to his decision to replace Maguire.
Trump blasted the reports about Russian interference as "disinformation" at a campaign rally in Las Vegas on Friday.
On Sunday, Trump accused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , of leaking the briefing's contents to the news media. Schiff responded by tweeting that Trump had "betrayed America. Again. "
"The President is angry because the intelligence community, in fact, informed Bernie Sanders and I guess others and members of the Intelligence Committee that, in fact, the Russians want to see Trump reelected," Biden said. "And they like Bernie. "
On Sunday, national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on "Face the Nation" that he had not seen any intelligence to support the leaked details from the briefing regarding Russian election interference.
"There's no briefing that I've received, that the president has received, that says that President Putin is doing anything to try and influence the elections in favor of President Trump. We just haven't seen that intelligence," O'Brien said.
O'Brien said he understood why the Russians would favor Sanders, who would "spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military. " But he did not see why Russia would want Trump reelected.

"Why would they have a preference for President Trump, who is rebuilding our military, who is giving the Ukrainians lethal aid to fight Russian troops?" O'Brien asked. "That doesn't make sense. "
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. , said on CNN's "State of the Union" that O'Brien "should stay out of politics. "
"Of course, it stands to reason that they want Donald Trump reelected, because he has been a gift to Russia," Murphy said. "He has essentially ceded the Middle East to Russian interests. He has accomplished more in the undermining of NATO than Russia has in the last 20 years. And he continues to effectively deny that they have an ongoing political operation here in the United States that, by and large, is intended to support Donald Trump and his allies. "
Though O'Brien insisted the administration has done everything it can to prevent foreign election interference, Biden agreed with Murphy's assessment.
"Every intelligence agency has told them they continue to be engaged in this activity," Biden said of the administration's response to Russian meddling. "There is not any question anymore. There's never been a question for the last three years. And what's he doing? Zero. What is the Republican leadership in the United States Senate and Congress doing? Zero. "

Don't Buy Into Big-Tech Hysteria; An industry of alarmists exaggerates social media's risks and ignores its value.

Texto completo: Is Big Tech "downgrading humanity"? So says former Googler and podcaster Tristan (rhymes with "twist-on") Harris, director of the weirdly named Center for Humane Technology. Mr. Harris and many of his fellow tech skeptics describe humans as little different from pets, believing everyone who uses Facebook or an iPhone is a manipulatable idiot. He couldn't be more wrong.
Mr. Harris preaches about an "attention crisis." OK, you have my attention. Testifying before the Senate last year, he said tech companies are in a "race to the bottom of the brain stem." He also claimed humans in the 21st century still have "Paleolithic emotions." Basically, "we're chimpanzees with nukes." Wait, did he just call you a chimp?
Elsewhere he has claimed that social networks are delivering "outrage that works on the piano key of your nervous system." The man can certainly turn a phrase. He explains that "technology is getting better and better at hacking human weaknesses." And you'd better put down that glass, because "we're drinking from the Flint water supply of information."
Mr. Harris's most fevered claim is that social media has taken over politics. "We're not really in control of world history anymore," he says. "The technology companies that are shaping our information sense-making environment are in control of every major electoral outcome, and whether people believe conspiracy theories." And there it is. It isn't Hillary Clinton's fault she lost in 2016. It was maybe the Russians and certainly Big Bad Tech. Mr. Harris insists "one side is currently winning by there not being regulation." You can probably guess which one he means.
Mr. Harris believes "we've been manipulated into this multiyear-long hypnotic trance," and that "we need someone to snap their fingers and wake all of us up out of this." A savior, a messiah. Might that someone be Mr. Harris?
Alarmism can be a lucrative business. In 2018 Mr. Harris received funding from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. He also has a deal with the brother of climate scold Tom Steyer to spend $7 million and use $50 million of donated media from Comcast and DirecTV, which have their own bone to pick with Big Tech. Maybe that's why Mr. Harris insists that "human downgrading is the climate change of culture." Uh boy.
Last month Mr. Harris asked Congress to launch a massive public-awareness campaign—"an inoculation campaign," similar to those run in the 1940s by the Committee for National Morale and the Institute for Propaganda Analysis. I'm not kidding.
Every generation goes through tremors when something new arrives. Elvis's hips. Pinball. TV. Rock 'n' roll. Videogames. For the most part, everyone turned out OK. Sure, we've all gone down the rabbit hole of hyperlinks and insect-fighting videos. So what? We're bored.
Mr. Harris is right to say we "need to upgrade human capacity," but the question is how. Social media, which he would kneecap through regulations like banning microtargeted ads, is actually doing that upgrading: training the next generation of knowledge workers, teaching them how to multitask, think in several dimensions, click and swipe their way to information, and find knowledge and solutions in a noisy world. Free 21st-century training.
Most important, users of today's media platforms are getting used to identifying fake news. Sorry, but people aren't stupid. Our internal defenses against deceit and bias go up when inundated and irradiated with nonsense.
News flash: There are charlatans and hucksters in the real world—in "meat space"—too. President Trump used a sharpie to fudge hurricane paths. Susan Rice blamed a video for the murders in Benghazi, Libya. The New York Times recently said "mourners" stormed the U.S. Embassy in Iraq last year, much as "students" took over the U.E. Embassy in Iran in 1978. There are free-trade agreements that aren't free. And if you like your doctor . . .
Yes, those under 16 need to limit their use of technology as their brains develop, but not cold turkey. Isn't that the job of parents rather than government or nonprofits? Remember when movies and TV were damaging our minds? Me neither. If anything, traditional media drives conformity, whereas social networks at least allow freedom of expression. Somehow that's now inhumane?
The cries of Mr. Harris and other aggravated social-media critics sound like demands to turn back the clock to simpler times. But there's no putting the toothpaste back in the tube. Only fools will try. For all its flaws, social networks and artificial intelligence keep delivering value and utility to users, training people for a world that moves in nanoseconds. Better to teach the next generation how to keep up. That's humane.

Romance is alive and well in Pac NW

Texto completo: Romance isn't dead. Not by a long shot.
There's a universe of love stories out there, and this area is home to four authors who are well-known writers in the romance genre.
February, the month for celebrating romance, is the perfect time to meet the women who create the storylines behind such successful series and discover that you may have more in common with them than you think:
Katee Robert
Contemporary and suspense romance
Katee Robert grew up in Spokane and used the Running Start program to finish up her high school years as quickly as possible.
"I grew up wanting to write, but my plan did not include writing, really," Robert said. When her young marriage led her to living overseas in Germany with a pair of children under the age of 2, "Writing became a necessary outlet for my survival."
Robert's first book rode the wave of "50 Shades of Grey" popularity boom - "Although my books are not in that soft porn arena," she said.
While Robert's romances feature very modern characters of all genders, her storylines also feature real situations and conversations with regard to consent and protection. "That's an important part of the storyline."
Writing is Robert's job, and reading is a very important part of it. The "heavier the deadline," she said, the more she reads. Robert purposely picks reading outside the genre she writes - which, depending on the month, ranges from young adult horror ("The Hunter of the Dead") to fan fiction ("Desperate Measures") and science fiction and contemporary romance.
Asked if she reads the same books as her children (ages 14, 12 and 4 year old), she laughed as the anime genre is very popular in their world. Would she allow her children to read her titles? "They are sooo not interested," Robert laughed. "Which is fine because while we don't censor what they read, they shouldn't read any books I write until they are over 18."
Even in a town full of authors, people are surprised when finding out Robert's profession as a romance author. "There is a whole umbrella of patronizing comments that people make, like, 'Oh that's not real writing' and other insults, but you just learn to let it go." The New York Times bestselling author quips, "They aren't my audience, they aren't my readers."
Latest titles by Katee Robert: "A Worthy Opponent" ("Wicked Villians" series), "Her Vengeful Embrace" ("The Island of Ys" series)
Asa Maria Bradley
Paranormal romance and urban fantasy
"Spokane has an incredibly supportive writing community," Asa Maria Bradley said. "And to be able to get together with other romance writers, just to chat and have dinner once a month, is great."
Bradley splits her time between writing and teaching physics at Spokane Falls Community College. Before being contracted to deliver paranormal romances with modern-day Viking warriors, "Someone had to point out to me I was writing romance," Bradley said. To her, "I was writing a good story."
Bradley would write mostly during school downtime and breaks, switching hats between teaching and writing daily. However, the publishing industry deadlines don't line up neatly with the academic calendar. Now Bradley has structured her life to give time to each, working three long days on campus and two days a week devoted to "writing until there are no more words left in me."
If you had told her 10 years ago that this was what her life would look like as a writer, she would have scoffed. "I thought you went into a cave, wrote the book, gave it to the publishing company and then go back into the cave and work on another book," she said. The work that goes into the marketing and publicity for the books once they are delivered to the publisher was a surprise, as was the access to her personally that readers of her work requested.
"I think that in the romance genre, more than any other, perhaps because the readers are so voracious, and they want access and expect access to the author," Bradley said. "That part surprised me. Maybe because I'm Swedish, I don't think people want to talk to me."
Social media is a part of her writing life, and Bradley decided early on to only use channels she would use regularly herself. Readers do connect with her on Twitter and Facebook, and Bradley has recently embraced Instagram. Other authors have advised her to stay away from political postings, but Bradley remains true to who she is, using good "social media manners," she said. "It's important that the audience knows you are being authentic."
Latest Asa Maria Bradley titles: "Loki Asccending" ("Viking Warriors" series), "Flash of Fear"("Power of Lightning" trilogy, Book 1)
Lucy Gilmore
Contemporary romance
"I've lived in Spokane my whole life, so yes, why not use the area I know in my books," said Tamara Morgan, who writes under the pen name Lucy Gilmore for the "Forever Home" series.
Morgan writes under three pen names: Tamara Berry is the name for cozy mysteries, Tamara Morgan is the name under her contemporary romances, and Lucy Gilmore is the pen name created at the request of her publisher. "It was a branding decision," she said as the puppy romance genre presented the opportunity to start a brand new slate. While she has three genres to juggle with her names, Morgan writes one book a series at a time.
"Each genre requires the same amount of energy for me to write, whether it is a mystery or a romance. I have family that talks to me about my mystery titles but pretend that my romance titles don't exist, that it's fodder for jokes," Morgan said.
Morgan's background as an English literature major influenced her reading. In her "pre-Kindle college days," one didn't walk around with a mass market paperback without inviting snooty looks and comments. "One of my friends pointed out that I might be reading the classics for the love stories, and I thought, huh, maybe?"
Writing is second nature to Morgan. Graduating into the recession, she became a freelance writer creating blog posts and web content writing every day. Sidelined by a surgery that coincided with National Novel Writing Month, Morgan committed to participating in that, and those efforts launched her into an agent's orbit, which led to a publishing deal, which in turn led to another agent and forays around small publishers and ebooks.
Now, more than 20 books and another agent later, she runs her business in writing with the same stamina she learned with NaNoWriMo: She has a word count that she meets every day and then moves on with her day.
The biggest misconception she finds people have with being an author is that it's a glamorous lifestyle. "I don't fly to meet my publishers, I write in my pajamas!"
Lucy Gilmore titles: "Puppy Love" and "Puppy Christmas" ("Forever Home" series)
Rebecca Zanetti
Paranormal and suspense romance
Rebecca Zanetti professes to being very lucky, but it's obvious her work ethic also is a resounding factor in her success. "I just turned in a book last night at midnight," she said over the phone last week. "I might sound a tad tired."
The quiet author life is not one that Zanetti leads. Every day is filled with doing something that propels her bestseller career - promotion, research, writing, editing - it's always something different. Zanetti has more than 50 titles to her credit, with accolades from the New York Times, USA Today and Amazon.
Zanetti was on the partner track as an up-and-coming lawyer until she was snowbound during a storm in 2009. She then decided to write and completed a book. Zanetti had attended writing workshops and enjoyed reading since sneaking into her mom's bag of books as a young teen. Her writing then mirrored the suspense, mystery and, yes, romance she read.
"I went from being on the partner track to writing about vampires, and my family was very supportive of that," Zanetti said. Her husband reads everything she writes, as does her mother. Their children are too young and, she says, frankly not interested in her job.
Zanetti considers herself a mystery and suspense writer. "People think that sex is the main part of what I write, and it's not," Zanetti said. "Don't get me wrong, erotica is a great genre, but that's not what I write.
Zanetti uses music to help her juggle multiple projects in her pipeline. Listening to a playlist can transport her back into a novel she wrote five years ago, the music triggering her memories of the storyline arc and characters. "Some people use candles, scents help them recall things, I use music," she said.
"I worry sometimes when I'm talking about my writing out in public with other writers. A snippet of conversation like 'How do you kill somebody?' or 'The body doesn't take that long to decompose' could be very easily misunderstood," Zanetti said.
Latest Rebecca Zanetti titles: "Fallen" ("Deep Ops" series), "Knight Awakening" ("Scorpious Syndrome" series)

Read about each of the four authors who are going to be at Monday's Northwest Passages book club event. TODAY, 1
There are variations of similar jobs that happen to get way more attention - even respect and adoration - than others that essentially do the exact same thing. Maybe even at a higher level and with more success than the "stars" do.
For most baseball fans, it's hard to name a middle-relief pitcher for the Seattle Mariners. Yet they are major leaguers playing at the highest level on a national stage.
We might know that Mark Zuckerberg was initially a programmer behind Facebook, but few of us could name the computer programmers who helped invent the first web browsers that were the real reasons why the internet has exploded in popularity and use.
(Shout out to Tim Berners-Lee and Marc Andreessen. #DorksUnite)
Then there are romance authors. Academia teaches certain types of writers. Other novelists talk about the authors who have inspired them. Cable television anchors love to interview writers of the latest White House exposé.
Then there are the romance writers few can actually name who are outselling many of those other writers by massive amounts. They're the major-league middle relievers every team wishes it had.
That's what makes Monday's Northwest Passages book club event so fun. In two years of hosting our wildly popular community event series, we've had big names, yet we've rarely had a stage full of authors who have sold anywhere near the amount of books as Asa Maria Bradley, Katee Robert, Rebecca Zanetti and Lucy Gilmore have.
We're literally talking about millions of books. Yes, plural.
Being relatively obscure despite the relatively high nature of their work doesn't bother them. It's just the opposite. This is much more of a feature than a flaw for many of those who write steamy books filled with personal relationships and drama. And paragraphs describing a kiss with some level of detail. Well, and some other love-kinda-stuff that's probably better left for professionals to explain and not be attempted by a newspaper editor whose looks could be the model for the nerd emoji.
"That's the part many of us really love about it," Zanetti said with a little laugh from her home in Hayden, Idaho, on Saturday afternoon.
"Being able to run out to your mailbox while wearing your pajamas and no one caring is great. But we also still get to travel to conventions and book stores and meet fans who love our books and the characters we've created, so it really is the best of both worlds."
And people love their books. Really, really love their books. As in Robert and Zanetti both have written New York Times bestsellers. They both have national USA Today bestsellers. Bradley and Gilmore are building impressive resumes, as well.
And if you haven't read a modern romance novel before, you might be surprised. These aren't the old Harlequin Romances many of us may or may not have seen in our homes when we were younger.
Many of these books are extremely well done. They include fantastic research for settings, characters and details you simply don't know unless you put in hours and hours of effort. They're suspenseful. They're smart. The characters in them are uncomfortably relatable.
The Washington Post described Zanetti's work as "sexy and emotional." It's that second word Spokane young adult literature legend Chris Crutcher, who also knows a thing or two about selling millions of books and still being relatively anonymous in his own hometown, said is the key to these romance writers' success.
Explaining that success means looking at how his genre and romance have a few common characteristics.
"Young-adult books have long been the stepchild of literature," Crutcher explained. "Book stores and libraries never really knew where to put these books because they crossed so many genres. That was because YA authors were really taking chances."
Crutcher said it wasn't unusual for a young-adult book to better integrate the role of technology in people's lives, or be science fiction, or be a mystery or be historical. That's exactly the freedom Crutcher sees modern romance writers embracing.
"Two things really jump out at me when it comes to romantic fiction. First off, these writers are getting people to read. You know, eyes moving from left to right and then down the page. That's a hard thing to accomplish. Secondly, they've figured out how to make emotional connections with readers. Emotion is one of the most important parts of a good book that you don't want to put down.
"People need to feel something when they read, otherwise it's just a pain in the ass," Crutcher said. "A book that doesn't evoke emotion is like reading a textbook. No one wants to read a textbook. Good romance writers get people to feel emotionally connected through their words, which makes people want to read even more."
Getting people to care about reading again - especially in an age of an always-on internet connection in the palm of your hand, seemingly infinite libraries of streaming movies and shows, and more entertainment options than any of us can imagine - that means so much to Robert as an author.
"Think of how many people who hadn't read a book in years who decided to pick up a copy of '50 Shades of Grey,' because of how many people were talking about it" Robert said. "More importantly, look at the sheer amount of those people who rediscovered how much they loved reading books and began buying books again."
She's absolutely right.
The "50 Shades" books were far and away the best-selling books of the previous decade, having combined to sell more than 150million copies by 2015, according to the Guardian newspaper. At a high point, two copies of the first book in the series were being sold every second.
This was all happening at a time when book publishers were deathly concerned that e-books might actually kill printed books. Yet it was a provocative romance novel about a Washington State grad from Vancouver, Washington, that showed the business that books could be successful - and profitable - if they were bound (which seems like the wrong word here considering the subject), or read digitally or listened to as an audiobook.
In a fashion similar to what happened two decades earlier with the Harry Potter series, books - and more importantly, reading - had become cool again. All of that being said, there aren't a lot of people who would recognize E. L. James, the author of the "50 Shades" books, if she were walking down the street in Pullman. Or shopping at a local grocery store. Or traveling through Spokane International Airport.
That's part of what makes writing highly successful romance novels so cool for the authors who are a part of Monday evening's Northwest Passages event at the Montvale Event Center. There's a chance you've seen them at Fred Meyer. And also seen one of their books while in the checkout lane.
Which, in case you're wondering, is as awesome a feeling as you think it might be for a writer.
Zanetti vividly remembers the first time she saw a display for one of her books in a major airport. It was in Atlanta just a few years ago.
She was so excited that she knocked the display over, with her books flying all over the place. Others quickly rushed over to help her pick up all of the books. She told them she was just so excited to see the book that, well, she accidentally bumped into the display as she rushed to take a photo of it.
She was asked why she was so excited about this particular book.
"Because I wrote it," she said. Needless to say, they all bought copies and had her sign it.
You see, romance novels really do have a way of getting people to buy books again.
Who knows, maybe one of them might someday write a romance novel about a middle-relief pitcher and then this analogy will really seem like something. That being said, one of the best baseball movies of all time - "Bull Durham" - might actually be a romance novel disguised as a sports flick.
This might be a question for some great local authors on Monday.

Texto completo: In the context of coronavirus and impeachment, the bankruptcy of America's second-largest newspaper chain, could not be expected to receive much attention. But such matters are of importance.

McClatchy is the publisher of the Miami Herald, the Charlotte Observer, the Kansas City Star and other newspapers.

The traditional newspaper business is struggling. Last year, New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet bleakly predicted that "most local newspapers are going to die in the next five years."

That would merely represent an extension of what has already been occurring.

According to a recent report from PEN America, the industry lost 47 percent of its jobs. At least 225 counties nationwide lack a local newspaper, according to a recent story in the Washington Post, quoting data from Penny Abernathy, the Knight chair of journalism and digital media economics at the University of North Carolina.

Among the nation's remaining 7,200 newspapers, at least 1,000 are deemed to be ghost papers, meaning they have become so damaged by cutbacks that they produce little original reporting, according to PEN.

In response, one might suggest that this is merely the market speaking. And why would an economist argue against the workings of a free market? Because I believe this to be market failure.

The internet is at the heart of what is transforming the newspaper industry. By 2015, Google and Facebook comprised about 75 percent of new digital advertising dollars in America, according to a recent story in the Financial Times. But Google and Facebook are not news organizations, and certainly not local ones.

We are all at risk.

You might ask why if local newspapers are so valuable that they can't charge enough to make the numbers work. Indeed, there are apparently many people who think that newspapers are doing just fine. But just 14 percent have paid for a local news source.

The reason newspapers can't charge enough is because there is dishonesty, many people are free-riding on the subscriptions of others and newspapers have to compete with effectively free sources of information, including the nightly local news. Not enough of us are consistently interested in in-depth understanding of the daily workings of our communities.

Collectively, we don't pay enough for the value we derive from local newspapers.

We need local reporting because we need vetted information to help us improve our communities. This is not to say that we agree with everything written in these publications; quite the opposite.

But we are faced with a loss of these types of publications given the present trajectory of such things and that is not a loss we can afford -- not now, probably not ever.

A Heavy future Half of American adults will face obesity, dire projections show

Texto completo: Climate change is not the only source of dire projections for the coming decade. Perhaps just as terrifying from both a health and an economic perspective is a predicted continued rise in obesity, including severe obesity, among American adults.
A prestigious team of medical scientists has projected that by 2030, nearly 1 in 2 adults will be obese, and nearly 1 in 4 will be severely obese. The estimates are thought to be particularly reliable, as the team corrected for underestimates of weight given by individuals in national surveys. In as many as 29 states, the prevalence of obesity will exceed 50%, with no state having less than 35% of residents who are obese, they predicted.
Likewise, the team projected, in 25 states the prevalence of severe obesity will be higher than one adult in four, and severe obesity will become the most common weight category among women, non-Hispanic black adults and low-income adults nationally.
Given the role obesity plays in fostering many chronic, disabling and often fatal diseases, these are dire predictions indeed. Yet, as with climate change, the powers that be in this country are doing very little to head off the potentially disastrous results, obesity specialists say.
Efforts like limiting access to huge portions of sugar-sweetened soda, the scientists note, are effectively thwarted by industries able to dwarf the effect of educational efforts by health departments that have comparatively minuscule budgets. With rare exceptions, the sugar and beverage industries have blocked nearly every attempt to add an excise tax to sugar-sweetened beverages.
Claims that such a tax is regressive and unfairly targets low-income people are shortsighted, according to Zachary J. Ward, public health specialist at Harvard and the lead author of the new report, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in December. "What people would save in health care costs would dwarf the extra money paid as taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages," he said in an interview.
In Philadelphia, where a soda tax of 1.5 cents an ounce took effect three years ago, total purchases declined by 38% even after accounting for beverages bought outside the city, his co-author Sara Bleich said.
However, she quickly added, piecemeal changes like this are not enough to make a significant difference in the obesity forecast for the country. Rather, nationwide changes are needed in the ubiquitous food environment. As the new report clearly demonstrated, Americans weren't always this fat; since 1990, the prevalence of obesity in this country has doubled.
People who blame genetics are fooling no one but themselves, Ward said. Our genetics haven't changed in the last 30 years. What has changed is the environment in which our genes now function.
"Food is very cheap in the United States, and super easy to access," said Bleich, a professor of public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. We eat out more, consuming more foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt, and our portion sizes are bigger.
As Ward noted: "You don't even have to leave home to eat restaurant-prepared food - just call and it will be delivered."
As a society, we also snack more, a habit that starts as soon as toddlers can feed themselves. "People are snacking throughout the day," Ward said. "Snacking is the normal thing to do in the United States. In France, you never see anyone eating on a bus."
We also eat more highly processed foods, which have been shown to foster weight gain, thanks to their usually high levels of calories, sugar and fat.
A recent study showed that even when controlling for weight, consuming lots of processed foods raises the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.
"It doesn't take that many extra calories to result in weight gain," Bleich said. "Through marketing, we're constantly being sold on foods we didn't even know we wanted. We're all about immediate rewards. We're not thinking about the future, which is why we're going to see more than half the population obese in 10 years."
Unless something is done to reverse this trend, Ward said, "Obesity will be the new normal in this country. We're living in an obesogenic environment."
"While there's no one thing to throw at the problem," Bleich said, "if I could wave a magic wand, I'd make a tax on beverages a federal mandate because they're the largest source of added sugar in the diet and are strongly linked to weight gain and health problems. When people drink their calories, they don't feel as full as when they consume solid food, so they end up eating more."
This may also be true for calorie-free sweet drinks. Although the jury is still out on cause and effect, the link between beverage consumption and greater intake of calories may also apply to drinks flavored with no-calorie or low-calorie sweeteners.
With a third of meals now being eaten out, Bleich suggested that prompting restaurants to gradually, surreptitiously reduce the amount of fat, sugar and calories in the meals they serve could help put the brakes on societal weight gain. "Menus could make healthier, lower-calorie meals the default option," she said.
Controlling portion sizes is another critically important step. "Big portions are especially motivating for low-income people who reasonably want to get more calories for their dollar," she said. Low-income groups already have the highest rates of obesity and, the new projections show, they are most likely to experience a rising prevalence of obesity and severe obesity. "From a policy perspective," Ward said, "prevention is the way to go. Children aren't born obese, but we can already see excessive weight gain as early as age 2. Changes in the food environment are needed at every level - local, state and federal. It's hard for individuals to voluntarily change their behavior."

Texto completo: Sy Sperling, 78, a businessman who helped bring the hair-loss industry into the mainstream with ubiquitous, self-effacing ads, died Wednesday at a hospital in Boca Raton, Florida.
His death was confirmed by his publicist, Terri Lynn, who said it followed a lengthy illness but did not specify the cause.
Sperling achieved a kind of cult fame in the 1980s, as a late-night commercial for his business, then called the Hair Club for Men, started playing on televisions around the country.
The son of a plumber from the South Bronx, New York, he had no training as an actor and merely stood in a bland room, reciting memorized lines to the camera. But he added a winning kicker.
"Remember," he said, about to hold up an old photo of his own bald pate. "I'm not only the Hair Club president, but I'm also a client."
Calls started pouring in from men interested in his hair-restoration salons, which offered various "weaving systems." Sperling quickly became the face of male hair loss - however much sat on his head - and helped pave the way for a booming industry in male health and cosmetics.
Often called the Infomercial King of late-night TV, he appeared in bits on "The Tonight Show" and "Saturday Night Live," stepped into the ring at WrestleMania and made the rounds on TV talk shows and radio for years.
"Even to this day people stop me in the street," he told The Wall Street Journal nearly 30 years after the ad first ran. "My whole TV success had to do with the fact that it was believable and that I was able to afford good TV time by going on late at night."
Seymour Sperling was born in the Bronx, and his father, David, was a plumber, and his mother, Carrie, was a bookkeeper.
He served in the Air Force while attending college before finding work in sales and home improvement. He started his business out of personal need: He had lost most of his hair by the time he was 25, leaving him feeling insecure.
"I was really unhappy with my appearance," he told The New York Times in 1993. "And it was destroying my self-confidence."
With a hair weave, he told the Journal, he felt he could sleep, style his hair and go out on dates without confronting the question that comes with wearing a toupee: "How do you explain, I got to take my hair off now?"
So with about $5,000 and their credit cards, Sperling and his girlfriend bought a defunct salon in Manhattan. There, they developed a hair-replacement system that used a very fine nylon mesh, adhesives and hair colored to match the customer's.
He told the Times that he wanted to remove some of the stigma around baldness.
"For years, men have felt funny even discussing it, much less trying to do something about it," he said. "I think what I've done is remove some of the embarrassment associated with men wanting to improve their looks."
The commercial that made his career first aired in 1982. It was inspired by titans of industry like Frank Perdue of Perdue Chicken and Victor Kiam of Remington Products, who started appearing in their own ads.
"I said, 'If they could do it with chickens and electric shavers, I'll do one for hair,'" Sperling said in a 2007 documentary, "Roots: The Hair-Raising Story of a Guy Named Sy."

Texto completo: The Bloomberg-Bernie battle is almost like a comic book come to life. The two combatants cover almost every cliché on the right-wing scorecard.
The right couldn't have invented a better candidate than Bernie Sanders. In 1971, he was kicked out of a commune for talking too much. In 1987, he recorded a folk album. The following year, he got married and left the next day for a combination fact-finding trip and honeymoon in the Soviet Union. When he returned, he sounded a bit like Lincoln Steffens, the famous journalist who'd said of the USSR, "I have seen the future and it works."
In Mr. Steffens' defense, he visited in 1919, two years after its founding and before most of the inconvenient mass murder and starvation. Mr. Sanders thought the Soviet Union was the future three years before it collapsed.
Of course, this isn't why most of Mr. Sanders' fans like him. He was on the right side of the civil rights movement when it really mattered. He's been a consistent advocate of what he calls democratic socialism here at home. And he's an unreconstructed enemy of the economic elites, particularly the hated "billionaire class."
Which brings us to Michael Bloomberg, who sits atop the 1% of the 1%. Mr. Bloomberg is a perfect stand-in for a completely different kind of liberalism, one that doesn't even like to call itself liberal. He headlined the launch of No Labels, an organization dedicated to getting ideology out of politics. A lifelong Democrat, Mr. Bloomberg switched labels to become a Republican to run for mayor in 2001. By his third term he was an independent. Now he's a Democrat because he's running for president.
As mayor of New York, he was a poster boy for a kind of arrogant, progressive-post-partisan technocratic government that prizes data over feelings. The data showed that obesity cost the health care system money, and since sugary sodas contributed to obesity, Mr. Bloomberg clamped down on them. The data showed that young black men committed most of the gun homicides, so Mr. Bloomberg clamped down on them with stop and frisk.
"Ninety-five percent of murders, murderers and murder victims fit one M.O. You can just take a description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops," Mr. Bloomberg said in 2015.
In a video from 2011 that's going around, Mr. Bloomberg offered a quasi-endorsement of "death panels."
"If you show up with prostate cancer, you're 95-years-old, [we] should say 'go and enjoy, you've lived a long life, there's no cure. We can't do anything,'" Bloomberg said. "If you're a young person, we should do something about it. Society's not willing to do that yet."
This isn't why his fans like him. For a long time he was an icon of the credentialed upper class who saw ideological culture-war fights as so much boob bait. More recently, he's become the liberals' "Chicago way" response to Mr. Trump.
If the right comes at you with a billionaire would-be Putin, you come back with a bigger billionaire would-be Lee Kuan Yew.
Both men represent strands of liberalism with very long pedigrees. Mr. Sanders can trace his lineage back to antiwar socialists and populists such as William Jennings Bryan and Eugene Debs, as well as to reformers such as Jane Addams. Mr. Bloomberg's antecedents can be found in democracy-skeptical "disinterested" progressive pragmatists such as Walter Lippmann, Oliver Wendell Holmes and the "Wisconsin School" economists.
Like Trump, both men are beneficiaries of our hollowed-out political parties, which are incapable of performing the gatekeeper function of the nomination process.
And that raises the stakes of their contest. Mr. Trump has transformed much of the GOP in his image. Too weak to protect their own brand, the Republicans have adopted his.
If either Mr. Sanders or Mr. Bloomberg wins the nomination, it will be interesting to see if the same thing happens to Democrats. If it's Mr. Sanders, will they become a populist party of Social Democrats? If it's Mr. Bloomberg, will the Democrats become the party of bureaucratic authoritarianism?
Again, Democratic politicians normally straddle these two tendencies. There are, of course, other options for primary voters. But the choice between these two is zero-sum, and if either man wins, the Democratic Party could end up making a choice that will define it as much as Mr. Trump has come to define the GOP.

Texto completo: "Coffee," said Buzzy O'Keeffe, owner of New York's renowned River Café in Brooklyn, "is the last thing a restaurant diner tastes - so it better be good."
For O'Keeffe, it seems, it's never good enough. Every couple of weeks he assembles his chef and several staff members for a blind tasting of brews from around the world. Those that pass muster - typically under 20% - might find their way into the restaurant's ever-changing house blend, which typically contains beans from Colombia, Brazil, Sumatra and Costa Rica.
"I have been searching for the perfect coffee since my 30s," said O'Keeffe, now in his discriminating 70s. "I have found that even the perfect blend will vary from time to time, depending on the year's crop - something like wine but not quite as fickle."
Last year, when I learned that he was planning a trip to coffee plantations in Costa Rica, I asked if I could tag along, a caffeinated cohort one might say.
On a balmy Sunday evening we arrived in San José, the country's sprawling capital.
O'Keeffe was interested in comparing freshly roasted Arabica coffee (Arabica beans are the highest quality; robusta beans are generally for the mass market) with what he purchases once the beans are exported to New York. (They should be very similar if delivered promptly and shielded from air and sunlight.) Our first destination was a coffee company outside of San José called Café Britt. It was founded in 1985 by Steve Aronson, an American now living in Costa Rica and a world authority on coffee whose career dates to the early 1970s as an apprentice taster in Manhattan.
"At that time all of the good Costa Rican coffee was exported, and the inferior stuff stayed here," Aronson explained. He wanted to change that. He launched the first gourmet coffee growing and roasting company in the country and began domestic distribution while at the same time building his export trade. Today Britt coffee is sold throughout much of Central and South America.
The company conducts hourlong tours of its half-acre educational plantation, followed by a discussion and a short film. Guests are taken through the steps of coffee bean processing from planting seedlings to harvesting what are called "coffee cherries," large red pods that hold two coffee beans each. Newly planted coffee bushes require three to four years to produce cherries. Once removed the beans are dried, husked in a special machine, graded and packed for transport. Some operations, like Britt, roast their beans in house before shipping. At the end of our tour came a "cupping," the professional term for coffee assessments. (The cupping is not part of the basic tour; there is a $20 supplement per person.)
"OK, when we begin will the coffee still be hot?" O'Keeffe inquired, sitting at a big round table holding about 20 half-filled ceramic cups. As with wine, the temperature at which coffee is served at professional tastings alters its characteristics - hot coffee releases more aromatics.
The coffee cups on the table contained brews from Arabica beans cultivated at different altitudes. Among them: Tarrazu, which thrives in the high mountains southwest of San José (typically characterized as medium-bodied and high in acid, with hints of chocolate); Tres Rios, east of the capital (also with ample acid and a full, smooth body); Central Valley (the high altitude region west of the capital and known for smooth and full-bodied brews); and Orosí, to the southeast, said to be almost floral, although that eluded us amateurs.
Aronson called out instructions.
"Stir the coffee, then place your nose so it's almost touching it. Sniff. Then lift the cup over your lip and slurp." Expectoration optional.
O'Keeffe tasted each brew methodically, returning to several for another slurp. He said that, for the most part, the differences were more subtle than he had expected.
"Being down here, I thought I'd be tasting peaches or something," he laughed.
The Britt tour, about an hour, concludes with a Costa Rican buffet lunch.
Heading to Starbucks central
The following morning we drove 5,000 feet above the lushly carpeted valley on the slopes of the irascible Poás Volcano, to the 2-year-old Starbucks global agronomy complex and visitors center called Hacienda Alsacia. I would go for the view alone. Situated on a 600-acre working plantation, it is where the company conducts farming research and development, creates programs to help small-scale coffee farmers around the world boost their income and educates the public about what Starbucks calls sustainable coffee.
The 1 1/2-hour tour is similar to that at Britt but more hands-on. It starts with demonstrations on how seedlings are planted and allowed to mature, and on how to dry beans by raking them over hot cement. At one point the tour guide asked for a volunteer to help dry the beans under a wilting sun. There were no takers. He drafted O'Keeffe, who stepped forward wearing the bemused expression of someone called onto the stage by a magician. Four round trips with the rake was enough. A cupping followed, and O'Keeffe noted that, not surprisingly, the darker the roast the more intensely acidic and flavorful the coffee. Think of Starbucks' sharp and heavily roasted - some say over-roasted - product.
Winding down the mountain we happened upon La Casona de Doña Julia, two large barnlike structures with a sign reading "Comida Auténticamente Costarricense" (Authentic Costa Rican Cuisine). We sat at a long picnic table and sipped chilled Imperial, a Costa Rican beer. Actually, by the time it arrived it was only half chilled. A word about dining in Costa Rica restaurants: Service is slow, really slow, take-a-walk-between-courses slow.
A luxurious brew
If you're looking for a little opulence with your Arabica, it can be found half an hour from the airport at Finca Rosa Blanca Coffee Plantation Resort. It's snuggled amid 30 undulating acres of coffee - everything is assiduously eco-friendly and sustainable - with 13 tropically themed rooms and two suites (doubles around $350 with tax).
The daily 2 1/2-hour coffee program, which is open to non-guests with reservations ($40 per person), is as much about rainforest ecology and preservation as what you sip at breakfast. Those of an avian bent can roam the heavily shaded 30-acre property to seek out some of the nearly 250 species of tropical birds.
"We're all about being green and sustainable," said the farm supervisor and head roaster, Carlos Sanchéz. "Even the hotel - we built it with recyclable materials."
Our final stop was in the town of Naranjo, another short hop from the city, at the Espíritu Santo Coffee Tour. The coffee itinerary - by now I could moonlight as a tour guide - in a 600-acre plantation is unveiled in seven stages, from planting to merchandising. It can be a long lesson, but the engaging guides sense when to pick up the pace. And not least, they are great with children.
Hurtling through so many cups of coffee in four days was educational, O'Keeffe noted, as coffee, like wine, is a moving target - and the tasting never stops.
This reminded O'Keeffe of a little story he sometimes pulls out of his wallet when in the presence of wine connoisseurs, about a television skit about wine tasting. "One actor said 'I taste raspberries!' and another said 'I taste pears, peaches, cherries!' and so forth," he said. When it came to the final actor, "He said, 'I taste crushed grapes.' It's like that with coffee tours."

Texto completo: Zoe Kravitz is in the process of curating a pretty dope playlist.
After a few catchy early numbers and some recent jams like "Big Little Lies," the actor, singer, model and now producer is pumping up the volume on her career with new Hulu series "High Fidelity" and, of course, Matt Reeves' "The Batman," in which she co-stars as Catwoman.
Variety caught up with Kravitz, 31, to talk romantic comedies, playing opposite Robert Pattinson and those "Big Little Lies" behind-the-scenes issues.

Q: Your character in "High Fidelity" is someone who lives and breathes music. Is that something you relate to?
A: Her inability to fully see herself is something I've experienced, something I've gone through. Someone who's able to understand something like music so deeply and then struggle to understand how a relationship works is really interesting to me. I've had those moments in my life where I felt like I understand art and music really well, I can talk about that, I can do that - but love is more complicated.

Q: What romantic comedies, other than the original "High Fidelity," were you looking to for inspiration?
A: "Sex and the City" was a major influence for me. There was a certain element of comedy and true drama and authenticity, wit and fearlessness that always attracted me, and it's also just such a New York show; for someone who lives there, they did it correctly. I've always been drawn to the kinds of stories that revolve around people stuck in a place and the things they talk about, because it felt like what I do with my friends. You sit around, you smoke weed, you talk about movies, you argue about characters and actors and music. That's some of my favorite (stuff) to do. When it's written well, when it feels real, it's so fun to see.

Q: Talk to me about the regular fourth-wall breaks; what do they illuminate about your character?
A: When you do those, you have to break a habit, because your whole career you're told to not look at the camera, not acknowledge it, so I had to allow myself to have a new relationship with the camera, to think of it as my friend. It's good to imagine a person there, you're talking to your friend because it can feel stiff and performative otherwise, because that device lets the audience into the character, especially because Rob is so guarded, it's important that she's able to feel vulnerable in those moments. I would literally picture a friend of mine in front of the camera and say I'm talking to a person right now.

Q: Those coupled with the subject matter feel very reminiscent of "Fleabag."
A: I actually didn't watch "Fleabag" on purpose ... because when we were writing it and people learned I was talking to camera, the first thing they would say is "Fleabag!" I felt like if I saw the show I would either imitate, or be intimated by, or compare myself to Phoebe's performance. I did not watch the show until after, and then of course I loved it and thought it was ... perfect.

Q: Switching focus to "The Batman," DC films come with their own unique brand of pressure. Is that something you're nervous about?
A: Definitely, I was excited when I got the role, and usually when you get a job, the people who are excited about it are you, your parents, your agent, your friends and that's kind of it. But when the press release came, I got more text messages and calls than I've gotten on my birthday, on my wedding day. All of a sudden, the reality began to sink in about what this means not only to me but to everybody else culturally - and the fans of this universe are so dedicated and opinionated.

Q: You could certainly say that.
A: It was a little scary, but also whenever I get nervous about something, I feel it pushes me to a better place, so I welcome the nerves. If you start focusing too much on what people are going to think you're doing yourself a disservice. Of course, I want to honor the fans and hope they like what I do with the role, but in order to do what I think I need to do with Catwoman, I have to go internal and forget about the rest of the world.

Q: How do you feel about Robert Pattinson as Batman? What has it been like working with him so far?
A: I've never worked with him before, but we've been together for the last few weeks ... training together and rehearsing together, and he's just a delightful person and such a wonderful, thoughtful actor. I think he's perfect for the role, and it's going to be such an adventure. I'm excited to have him as my partner in crime and to be there to support each other, because it's intense. It's going to be a long shoot and there's a lot of pressure, and I know he has my back and I have his.

Q: Nicole Kidman said she would be open to doing another season of "Big Little Lies," but she pointed to your busy schedule to say that a potential Season 3 won't be here for some time.
A: Mine?! How about Meryl or Reese or Shailene? For wonderful reasons everyone's busy, but I think we would all make time to make another season happen. It really feels like priority No. 1 for a lot of us, because we love each other, and we love the story and we love culturally what it means to people. I feel like all of us would clear whatever we could to make that happen. But don't try and throw me under the bus, Nicole!

Q: Did you feel like Season 2 provided a satisfying ending to Bonnie's story?
A: I don't know if it felt like an ending, but it felt like there was a breakthrough, especially coming from Season 1 where she's seen as this picture-perfect, very Zen person. It was nice to break that all down this season. It's almost like we met Bonnie for the first time by the end of Season 2. It's always a delight to get the opportunity to go deeper into a character, because you don't always get a chance to do that.
Caption: Zoe Kravitz says "Sex and the City" was a big inspiration for her latest role in Hulu's "High Fidelity." "It's such a New York show," she said.

What Harvey Weinstein's lawyer fails to grasp Hollywood producer's lead defense attorney says she never put herself 'in that position' to be sexually assaulted Balancing Act

Texto completo: We should talk about minute 24.
It's the moment on "The Daily," the New York Times podcast, when reporter Megan Twohey asks Harvey Weinstein's lead defense attorney, Donna Rotunno, if she's ever been sexually assaulted.
"I have not," Rotunno answers. "I have not. Because I would never put myself in that position."
Twohey, co-author of "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement," which chronicles the Weinstein story from start to publication, pauses.
"So you're saying - actually, I'm sorry," Twohey says after a beat. "So you're saying that you have never been sexually assaulted because you would never put yourself in the position of being sexually assaulted?"
"No," Rotunno answers. "I've always made choices, from college-age on, where I never drank too much, I never went home with someone that I didn't know, I just never put myself in any vulnerable circumstance. Ever."
Rotunno has a role to play, and she's not going to go off-script during an interview with the reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize for the reporting that took down her client. Rotunno's job is to cast doubt on Weinstein's accusers. Her answer attempts to do just that.
But it also propels an ugly myth about assault that we need to push back on when it rears its ugly head.
Rape is not caused by poor choices. Rape is caused by rapists.
You can try to minimize your risks of being raped, just as you can try to minimize your risks of becoming the victim of any number of violent crimes. But that's not always enough. And if it has, for you, been enough, you are also the beneficiary of some very good luck.
Good luck to have been born into a home in which no one preyed upon you. Far, far too many children aren't so lucky.
Good luck to have never crossed paths with a predatory coach or mentor or youth group leader or priest or classmate or instructor or medical practitioner or boss.
Good luck to have not been the victim of spousal rape.
Good luck to have never been abducted.
Good luck to have gone through life, so far, without someone using their power - power in the form of a weapon, power in the form of physical size, power in the form of authority - to rob you of your bodily agency.
I wish every woman and man, girl and boy had such luck. They don't.
Maybe Rotunno subscribes to the just-world fallacy - the belief that we live in a morally fair society, and people who encounter misfortune likely had some hand in causing that fate. That's certainly easier than accepting that terrible things sometimes just happen. Unprovoked. Unjustly.
Or maybe she answered in the way that felt, to her, as honest as possible while still being as strategic as possible.
Regardless, her answer was toxic.
Because it adds to the already far too prevalent messages that assault survivors are slapped in the face with repeatedly: that they could have prevented their assault, that they had some hand in causing their assault, that they should have known better than to become a victim of assault.
It contributes to a culture of doubt and denial and blame that victims have to navigate when deciding whether to come forward with their stories - stories that, if they are heard and heeded, can save more people from being victimized. How many athletes may have been spared Larry Nassar's reign of terror if coaches and parents and college administrators acted as soon as the gymnasts in his care started speaking up?
And it slows us down from learning what we really need to grasp and understand about sexual assault: that it is, above all, an abhorrent abuse of power. It is a stripping away of another person's autonomy. It is a debasing of that person's humanity. It says, "I matter. You don't."
No one puts themselves in that position. To surrender their autonomy and humanity. To not matter.
Rotunno is doing her job. Maybe it will work in court; maybe it won't.
But when her words float into the national dialogue as they did on that podcast, the rest of us get to make our own judgment. The rest of us get to reject that (il)logic.

Texto completo: Italy, a country known for its language of love and for its men who publicly shower overtures on women, is often associated with romantic encounters of the kind portrayed in the movies, from "Roman Holiday" to "The Lizzie McGuire Movie." So some black women ask, why shouldn't it be the same for them?
Latrese Williams is one such black traveler. When Williams goes out in Chicago or pretty much anywhere else in the U.S., she said, she often feels ignored by men. But when she walks into a room in Italy, all eyes are on her -- and to her, that's a good thing. These polar reactions occur, she said, because she is black.
"Even though I would behave in the same way at home and abroad, in Chicago I felt invisible," Williams said in her home in the Monti neighborhood of Rome. "But in Italy I kept meeting guys."
In November, she moved in with her Italian boyfriend, whom she met on Tinder in Rome.
In recent years, Italy has become known for widely publicized episodes of racism against African migrants or dark-skinned people perceived as migrants, and even racial abuse toward Italy's own black soccer players. It may be surprising that there is a steady stream of black women who travel to Italy in search of amore.
Perhaps less surprising is that, amid the new crop of travel companies catering to black travelers and black women, in particular, there's a growing group of tour providers, blogs, Instagram accounts and Facebook groups that encourage black women to travel to Italy to find love. Unlike traditional tour operators, companies like Black Girl Travel and Venus Affect provide dating advice and assistance finding a romantic partner, along with sightseeing.
Online, Pinterest, Instagram and Tumblr posts show photos of black women with Italian men or black women with white men in Italy; Facebook groups and YouTube videos contain lengthy discussions about Italian men loving black women. Many of the posts are tagged with the word "swirl," a popular term describing a black person and a white person in a relationship.
Fleace Weaver, the founder of Black Girl Travel, said that she felt early on that African American women "do better in Italy," so, in 2006, after traveling to the country several times, she moved to Rome from Los Angeles and created Black Girl Travel, which offers romantic and nonromantic tours.
"No one was servicing us doing tours that were targeted solely to African American females," she said. "In fact, when we started, everyone in the industry was telling us it was impossible to do. Now you look ahead 13 years, and we have basically inspired a whole subculture of international travelers."
Weaver describes Black Girl Travel as a concierge and private club rather than a travel or dating agency, but her clients consider it to be both. In more than a dozen interviews, women who have been on her tours called her "the dream weaver" and the "black woman's Italian love guru," thanks to her ability to connect people and help women love themselves and find romantic love. Black Girl Travel has welcomed more than 1,000 black women from across the world to Italy, Weaver said.
She insists that her main goal is to encourage black women to love themselves first. In addition to the sightseeing, "I also always work in girlfriend talk time where we stop as a group and we talk about like: 'Why do you think your life is not going in the direction you want to go in? Why do you think that you're having problems with men?' "
Williams, 44, who felt ignored in the U.S., had studied abroad in Germany during graduate school and recalls visiting Rome and hating it at the time. She went home to Illinois to establish her career and, she thought, a relationship. Twenty years later, frustrated with her job and her romantic life, she booked a Bella Italia tour with Black Girl Travel. The tour cost about $2,500, excluding airfare, and visited popular cities and landmarks. There were about 50 other black, primarily American, women on the 10-day trip, and at its end Williams was seriously considering the idea of looking for love in Italy.
Three years later, Williams went on a second tour with Weaver, and each time she'd return to Rome she would see Weaver and seek advice about dating. Many women who go on the Bella Italia tour return for Weaver's Roman Holiday tour, a more personal experience that involves staying with Weaver while she helps with all aspects of dating. She manages her guests' dating profiles on apps like Tinder and "weeds out" the bad eggs. When a client goes on a coffee or dinner date, Weaver might be at a table nearby, observing, taking notes and planning to give feedback to the client afterward.
Venus Affect, created by celebrity wedding planner and event designer Diann Valentine in 2014, works exclusively with wealthy women and matches them with men who are well-off. About 75% of Valentine's clients are black; the rest are Hispanic or Middle Eastern, she said. In 2018, Valentine's company was the focus of a short-lived Bravo show, "To Rome for Love."
"As black women, we are told in the U.S. that we are too aggressive and too bossy and too loud and all these negative stereotypes we hear all the time," she said. "But you put us in Italy and we're perfect because you know who else is bossy and loud and aggressive? Italian mothers."
But what these companies are selling -- amore and la dolce vita -- is at odds with the everyday experiences of a number of black people who live or travel frequently in Italy. They point out that this is a country where populist politicians like Matteo Salvini have campaigned on the argument that illegal migration from Africa poses a threat; in 2013, the country's first black minister had bananas thrown at her. According to data from the International Organization for Migration, between 2014 and the first six months of 2017, Italy had a 600% increase in the number of potential sex-trafficking victims arriving in the country by sea. In 2017, a majority of those victims were black, from Nigeria.
"The whole idea of marketing Italy to black women as a place where they can find love is so problematic for so many reasons," said Moni Ufomata, who is black and has traveled to Italy and runs the blog Miles and Braids, about her adventures. "I loved Italy because of the food, the monuments, the history. That's the stuff that should be the goal of your travels."
Some black women who move to Italy for love say they have been told that they are being fetishized by Italian men intrigued by black culture and physical features but not interested in understanding more about being black or really connecting with the women as individuals.
Gichele Adams, a black woman who lives in Milan with an Italian partner and runs the short-term rental company Ghost Host Retreats, said that argument is a tool to shame black women from dating outside their race.
Three years ago, after moving to Paris, Adams decided to go on a solo trip to Italy for a few days. While in Milan, she met Matteo La Cognata, a man who spent two days showing her the city. Before she left Milan for Venice and Rome, he invited her to stay for good. She thought he was "completely crazy" she said, and passed.
When she returned to Paris, she realized that she didn't want to be there anymore. She flew to Milan, met La Cognata's family and moved in with him. They now have a 2-year-old son and are expecting their second child in the spring.
La Cognata said that they do get comments from Italians who assume Adams is a migrant from Brazil or Africa who somehow does not belong in Italy. The comments, he added, are worse when she is out alone.
"Luckily I tend to not give too much attention to these idiots," he said.

Stylish kitchens on a budget

Texto completo: People often assume that getting a gorgeous kitchen like the ones they see in design magazines would require draining their bank account. And often, they're right: Building a custom kitchen with upscale materials and finishes can easily run into six figures.
What they might not realize is that there are cost-saving alternatives that can deliver a high-end look for a fraction of the price. One of the most popular is building a kitchen with Ikea cabinets and then covering those cabinets with custom doors, drawer fronts and panels from companies like Reform, Semihandmade and Kokeena.
"Ikea makes a great box," said John McDonald, the founder and chief executive of Semihandmade, a company based in Monrovia, California. And inside its Sektion cabinets, he added, Ikea "uses the best hardware you can get."
Nathan Cuttle, an interior designer who founded New York-based Studio Nato, has built numerous kitchens with Ikea cabinets and custom doors from Reform and Semihandmade. "We've done some tight-budget projects," he said, "but still wanted them to be unique."
We asked designers and manufacturers to walk us through the process.

Find your inspiration
The first step in creating a kitchen you love is figuring out exactly what you want by searching for inspiration in design books, magazines and online sources like Pinterest, Instagram and Houzz.
Do you prefer upper cabinets or open shelves? Do you want an island? Do you like doors or drawers for the lower cabinets? Do you want custom panels to cover the dishwasher and refrigerator, to give them a built-in look?
Also consider the design and color you want for the finishing doors, drawer fronts and panels by browsing the offerings of custom door manufacturers, either online or in their showrooms.

Create a preliminary layout
Measure your kitchen floor and walls. Then begin designing the layout of your kitchen with Ikea's online kitchen planner.
"You can put the dimensions of your kitchen into it and play with all the different configurations," said Whitney Menefee, a founder of Townsend Interiors, in Portland, Oregon. "Even if you have no design experience at all, you can use that software to design your kitchen," she said, by selecting and placing cabinet boxes on a floor plan. It automatically generates a shopping list of parts.

Contact the door manufacturer
Once you have a preliminary design and a style of door selected, share your plans with the custom door manufacturer.
"We recommend the client give us an Ikea drawing with the Ikea fronts and side panels on because then we know exactly what is needed," said Jeppe Christensen, a founder and the chief executive of Reform. "We also tell them to include handles, so we can see where they want the doors hinged."
Then the company produces a quote for custom doors, drawer fronts, panels and other elements as replacements, while confirming the details of the design.
"There are always some small adjustments," Christensen said, so don't buy the Ikea components before making arrangements for the doors.

Place the orders
When your kitchen design is finalized with the door manufacturer, it's time to order the parts.
To ensure you have everything you need from Ikea, Christensen and Edwards recommended providing a complete kitchen design, with Ikea doors, drawer fronts and panels, to the retailer, and asking a sales associate to remove those finishing components from the order.
"When you go to order it from Ikea, you take your entire list but say, 'We're doing custom,' " Edwards said. "They'll eliminate just the doors and drawer fronts from the cabinets."
Ikea usually has its cabinet components in stock, so they can be bought and brought home on the same day.

Install the cabinets and doors
Ikea kitchens are based on a modular system that can be assembled and installed by a homeowner who is handy with tools, and putting on doors and drawer fronts is one of the most straightforward parts of the process. Whether the doors are from Ikea or a custom manufacturer, they come predrilled for hinges and screws.
For those who don't have the skill or inclination to build their own kitchens, there are plenty of options for finding a contractor who can do the work.

Finish up
While cabinet installation may be a do-it-yourself project, some of the finishing touches are best left to professionals. Licensed plumbers and electricians should complete any work on pipes or wiring, along with the installation of plumbing fixtures and built-in appliances.
There is also an opportunity to upgrade the look of your kitchen further with the counters. Choosing something different can add to a kitchen's custom look, and there is no shortage of choice, from natural stone like marble and granite to stainless steel.

India set to stage an epic show, with Trump as the star

Texto completo: The roads are a hive of activity: women hoisting buckets of sand, work crews laying down fresh tar, an army of sweepers attacking debris and a new wall going up in front of a slum, apparently to hide it from passersby.
President Donald Trump is scheduled to land in the western city of Ahmedabad on Monday for his first presidential visit to India, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has planned an epic spectacle. The city is being scrubbed clean, and thousands upon thousands of Modi loyalists have been drafted to stand for hours on the sun-baked streets, there to shake flags and cheer for a president who loves nothing more than to draw a crowd.
It is the second act of a budding friendship between the two men, leaders of the world's most populous democracies. Last year, Trump and Modi shared a stage in Houston at a rally called "Howdy, Modi!" This one is called "Namaste Trump," which translates roughly as "Hello Trump."
But beneath the projected bonhomie lies a pricklier reality. The United States and India are strategic partners, in no small part because of a mutual concern over China, but they still can't agree on crucial issues. Even a small trade deal that was supposed to be the centerpiece of this trip has collapsed.
"They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years," Trump said last week of India.
But he was quick to add: "I really like Prime Minister Modi."
Modi seems to have enticed Trump to fly 8,000 miles and spend two days in India by his promise to stage a huge, tightly controlled show, with Trump at its center. The president has repeatedly claimed that he has been guaranteed a crowd of 5 million to 7 million people lining the roads to greet him, and on Thursday he upped that to 10 million.
Ahmedabad officials said it would be nowhere near that, more like 100,000 along the road and another 100,000 waiting for Trump in a new cricket stadium, where he will hold a rally.
Trump is popular in India, where he is seen as a strong leader, tough on terrorism, pro-business and friends with Modi. The two share a similar brand of divisive, populist politics. Still, Modi is taking no chances, fielding tens of thousands of police officers and packing the crowds with people he can trust to cheer enthusiastically for his guest.
Just to stand along the road that Trump's motorcade will travel for a few minutes on Monday requires a special pass, given to carefully vetted party members, their allies and special groups hand-picked by the government. This is a level of control Modi can deliver in India that is very different from Britain, for example, where Trump treaded carefully to avoid the optics of hostile crowds.

How to build happy, healthy unions

Texto completo: Rather than fretting over whether straight America is ready to accept former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg's happy, loving, gay marriage -- as talk show host Rush Limbaugh has been doing -- straight America may want to take a cue or two from same-sex marriages, which are statistically some of the happiest around.
Social scientist Stephanie Coontz, director of research and public education for the Council on Contemporary Families, analyzed data from several recent studies on the satisfaction and stability rates of couples in heterosexual, gay and lesbian marriages. Men married to other men reported the lowest levels of psychological distress in their marriages. Women married to men reported the highest levels of strain.
Gay and lesbian couples, Coontz found, tend to approach conflicts with more humor and affection, spend less time criticizing and lecturing each other and offer each other more praise and encouragement, compared with their heterosexual counterparts.
"As a marriage historian," Coontz told me, "it seems to me we're totally entering uncharted territory. Never before in history have we tried to do marriage in a way that is totally free from dictation by our biology -- whether we can or can't have babies; whether we have to have babies -- or by legal assignments that only husbands can do this and only wives can do that. It's the first time we've really tried to build marriages that were not laid out for us by law and hundreds of years of customs."
Why not build them into the happiest, healthiest unions they can be?
"Since same-sex couples can't use imputed male-female differences to sort out who does what, they rely less on stereotypes," Coontz wrote in a recent New York Times opinion piece. "Heterosexual parents tend to see tasks such as child care and laundry as part of a package that is handed to one partner. Same-sex couples are far more likely to each take on some traditionally 'feminine' and some 'masculine' chores."
She cited a 2015 time-use survey that found 74% of same-sex couples shared routine child care equally, compared with 38% of straight couples.
"It's not a question of good or bad, villains or victims," Coontz told me. "It's a question of whether we can look at other models and say, 'Huh. How do you do it when you don't know that women's work is this and men's work is this?' "
The University of Texas sociologist Debra Umberson co-authored one of the studies Coontz analyzed. Umberson's work focuses less on the division of housework and child care and more on emotional labor.
Women spend more time taking the emotional temperature of their partners and their marriages than men do, Umberson found, and that's true whether women are married to men or women are married to other women. Men -- gay or straight -- tend to do less preemptive emotional wellness check-ins with their spouses. ("How are you feeling? Do you need to talk?")
Neither style is inherently good or bad. But conflict can arise when one partner's style differs dramatically from the other partner's, and that tends to happen more, statistically speaking, in heterosexual marriages.
"It's kind of stressful to constantly be aware of someone's emotional needs and respond to them," Umberson told me. "But even if it's a little bit hard and a little bit stressful, if it's reciprocated and there's love in the relationship, then it can be a really positive thing."
But not always an easy thing.
"Because of 200 years of rigid socialization, these roles have been around long enough that we fall into habits even if we want to do things differently," Coontz said. "We have 200 years of driving our wagon down exactly the same road, and the ruts have gotten pretty deep. So it takes some effort to pull into the new lane, so to speak."
Coontz says it's valuable to keep those centuries of socialization in mind when we're interacting with the opposite sex.
"Men have been told for 200 years that the way you show love is to explain things, to protect and to provide," she said. "And women have been told to listen and check in and do all these emotional care tasks. We've been socialized to think that we're so different from one another, and it's easy to slide into defensiveness."
Same-sex couples, on the other hand, are partnerships between two people who haven't spent their entire lives being told how mysterious and unknowable (and unreasonable) their partners are.
Now that same-sex marriages have been legal across the nation for close to five years, all marriages can benefit from research that explores their ins and outs, ups and downs.
"Relationships are so variable, and you can't say one group does it all better and one group does it all worse," Coontz said. "But the more we can look at each other's styles of problem-solving and relating and mix and match -- not try to imitate, just mix and match -- what works for us in our individual relationships, the better off we'll be."
Love is, indeed, a many splendored thing.

Texto completo: Everyone's a critic, even when it comes to your wedding. Especially when it comes to your wedding.
Maybe the groom chomped Bubble Yum as he recited his vows. Or the bridesmaids' flowers were shaped like baby Yoda. Or the minister yelled at photographers just for doing their job.
Whatever the blunder, on the Reddit thread r/weddingshaming or on a series of private Facebook groups dedicated to wedding disparagement -- most notably "That's It, I'm Wedding Shaming (Non Ban-Happy Edition)" -- matrimonial misanthropes can voice their opinions on everything from the bride's camouflage gown to the happy couple's first toke. (Yes, it was a pot-themed wedding.) According to another Reddit thread, top shame-worthy moments include a middle-age man pushing a child out of the way so he could catch the bouquet and hand it to his girlfriend; a best man who publicly confessed to sleeping with the bride two days earlier; and a couple whose dogs toddled down the aisle and left an unsavory gift.
"It's a never-ending source of entertainment," said Jessica Taylor, 31, a nursing assistant in Penacook, New Hampshire, and frequent commenter who was married in July. "I also loved learning what not to do."
The wedding-shaming trend grew in popularity in mid-2018, when "That's It, I'm Wedding Shaming (Non Ban-Happy Edition)" was born. The founders, Anton Justice and Hannah Chante, were planning their 2020 wedding and looking for ideas. But they couldn't find anything that spoke to them. "In other groups you get kicked out if you say something negative," said Justice, 22, a marketing student in Calgary, Alberta. "It's better to know what people think rather than lie and be nice about it."
So he and Chante, 19, decided to start a forum where people could speak their mind. The group gained traction in August 2018 after model Chrissy Teigen retweeted the story of a bride who allegedly canceled her wedding after guests refused to pay $1,500 to attend. The group has grown to around 147,000 members worldwide and receives about 2 million interactions every month, Justice said. Ancillary shaming groups -- targeting things like cakes, dresses, rings and sisters-in-law -- have also emerged.
Almost all have guidelines. On the Facebook wedding-shaming groups, faces are blacked out unless the person is in the public eye. Racism, sexism, homophobia and body shaming also are not tolerated. "You don't want to make anyone feel singled out or attacked personally," Justice said. "It's more about the wedding than the person."
Sometimes the shaming is reserved for the venue, like when a banquet manager interrupted the newlyweds' first dance to discuss their tab. Other times the shamer is shamed, as a woman was when she complained about a couple's choice of the secular "Here Comes the Sun" in a Roman Catholic ceremony. ("Someone has never seen 'Sister Act,' and it shows," one commenter wrote.) And sometimes people call themselves out. "I didn't realize till after how out of the place the groom looked with his pink dress shirt, jeans, and rubber shoes," one bride wrote of her betrothed. "He looked like he just casually strolled in and happened to get married."
But other times the masses are the chorus, and the comments can be downright mean. Aleisha McCormack, who runs a private non-shaming wedding group with about 10,000 members, recalled the time someone reposted a photo of one of her members in a shaming group. There were negative comments about the bride's dress and body shape. "I felt really upset that they promote that they won't body shame or promote mental illness or focus on these topics and so often they do," said McCormack, author of the "Bridechilla" guides. "Some of the comments were just revolting." She reached out to the administrator, who removed the offensive post.
Anna Bozman Thompson, a stay-at-home parent from Atlanta, had an even more upsetting experience. Now 39, she married Travis Thompson, a contractor for Federal Express, in October 2015. Earlier that year, her 8-year-old son from a previous relationship, Lake Bozman, had died of acute myeloid leukemia.
Bozman Thompson knew she wanted Lake to be a part of the wedding. How to do it? Through photographs. "Pictures are just everything," she said. "It's all that I have left of him. So the pictures for my wedding were the most important thing to me."
She contacted Brandy Hayes Angel, who operates Be the Change, Brandy Angel Foundation, which offers free photos to families facing life-threatening illnesses. Angel had taken pictures of Lake in October 2014, and the women had become friends. Angel's wedding photos included portraits of the couple, their two surviving children and a superimposed, ghostly image of Lake.
"To see him in the pictures with us gave me comfort," Bozman Thompson said. "And I did feel he was there. He was a huge part of our ceremony and everything we do. It would have been weird to have had a wedding picture that he wasn't in."
A few months later, she shared the image on his Facebook page, "Prayers for Lake Bozman." The photo went viral. And that's when the shamers got hold of it. One woman posted on "That's It, I'm Wedding Shaming (Non Ban-Happy Edition)" that she found the images with Lake "beyond inappropriate." The post received more than 3,000 comments, some of which also took issue with the photo. ("I'm from Texas and this is still really distasteful and disrespectful and tacky.") But many others shamed the shamer.
Justice acknowledged that policing the group can be challenging, so he tries to adhere to Facebook's code of conduct. "We're not there to control content -- we're a place to be expressive," he said. "Everybody has a different perspective on what's offensive."

Texto completo: Poisoning, verbal abuse, neglect, decapitation by piano wire: These are just a few of the sins committed by mothers in horror movies.
Whether harming their children or raising monsters of their own, these women eschew maternal expectation so thoroughly as to harm humanity. The anti-mothering in movies like "Psycho," "Carrie," "Antichrist" and "Hereditary" is so blatant it borders on sacrilege -- no accident, as each of these movies deals in zealotry as well as maternal abuse.
"The Lodge," from "Goodnight Mommy" directors Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, and the upcoming "Swallow," from Carlo Mirabella-Davis, present more complex takes on spurned motherhood. In both films, the central mother figures are unprepared for their new roles -- what's more, in a disturbing blow to the patriarchal nuclear family, these women are ambivalent about motherhood itself. But as the films' many terrors unfold, it seems they were right to be reluctant.
"The Lodge" centers on Grace (Riley Keough) and her soon-to-be stepchildren Mia (Lia McHugh) and Aiden (Jaeden Martell). The children are scarred by their mother's recent suicide, partly driven by the revelation that her husband intends to marry his mistress, Grace. At the same time, Grace is recovering from her childhood in a Waco-meets-Heaven's Gate death cult.
Young and awkward, Grace does her best to win over her fiance's children. But Mia and Aiden, determined not to let this woman replace their mother, set out to exploit Grace's trauma when the three are forced together for Christmas in their family vacation home. The results are gut-wrenching, as an addled Grace turns on her juvenile charges. Although one woman gets the most screen time, "The Lodge" is really about three mother figures: the children's dead mom, the Virgin Mary (via a foreboding portrait in the dining room) and Grace. A martyr, a saint and -- at least in the children's eyes -- a harlot.
So go three popular sexist tropes, with mothers -- stereotypically sexless figures -- usually falling into martyrdom or sainthood. In horror movies, where social comforts are upended for maximum disturbance, this idealism curdles into (often literal) demonization. In the Lars von Trier movie "Antichrist," the mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) does not prevent her child's fatal fall, portending her psychotic attempts to kill her husband in a forest called Eden. Ellen, the dead matriarch and closet occultist of Ari Aster's "Hereditary," invites a malevolent spirit to puppeteer her daughter and granddaughter, thus leading to the end of her entire family. Then there's Margaret White, the mother of Carrie, and Norma Bates, the mother of Norman, two obsessive, sexually obsessed Christian parents who smother their children to a fault. As Sady Doyle writes in her book "Dead Blondes and Bad Mothers," "At the heart of horror is a bad mother; the familiar and terrible vision of a woman corrupting the world, unleashing her own flaws upon it through her monstrous children."
"The Lodge" finds Grace struggling against a mother and father from her own past, in the form of the Virgin Mary and the priest who led her former cult (played, quite unsettlingly, by Riley Keough's real-life father, Danny Keough). But unlike other horror mothers, Grace's upbringing does not make her fundamentally violent, nor does she instigate the violence between herself and the children. Instead, Aiden and Mia put Grace through grueling emotional and physical torture, hiding her food, belongings and psychiatric medication and playing tapes of her old priest until they eventually trigger her cult programming.
There is no unending maternal love to save these three, as in horror films like "Bird Box" or "The Conjuring." Instead, "The Lodge" implies what other horror films are usually too afraid to say: Motherhood, with all its sacrifice and crushing expectation, might not be worth it for everyone.
That message is likely to be familiar to fans of "Rosemary's Baby," though the film's protagonist eventually accepts the malevolent force that invades her home (and uterus). Recent takes on the reluctant or terrified mother include "The Babadook," Jennifer Kent's debut feature about a mother troubled both by her misbehaving son and a demonic force; "Prevenge," Alice Lowe's slasher about a pregnant woman whose fetus compels her to kill; and "Swallow," about Hunter Conrad (Haley Bennett), a dutiful housewife who, once she learns she is pregnant, begins compulsively swallowing dangerous inanimate objects.
Hunter appears to have a charmed life. Wide-eyed and bubbly, she spends her days homemaking and playing games on her cellphone. She was a retail worker who bagged a rich man. Bearing his child is just another privilege, like en suite bathrooms or the latest iPhone. Her pregnancy gifts her life with purpose. Still, she swallows a thumbtack well before her second trimester.
Determined to have her produce an heir, her domineering in-laws shuttle her off to therapy to uproot the compulsion. There, placidly smiling, she reveals a family trauma that disassembles any preconceived notions about the film's relationship to gender, motherhood or even Hunter herself. She's no twit, and her destructive behavior -- inspired by that of Mirabella-Davis' own grandmother, who was lobotomized for a hand-washing compulsion -- becomes a savvy and tragic bid to retain her selfhood. What little independence she has as a wife can be distilled into the moments she steals to swallow objects, her private world as small as the tray on which she places a marble, an earring, a battery.
"The Lodge" and "Swallow" are so effectively disturbing because there are few Freudian terrors more primal than that of the mother figure who turns on her children, or the woman who violently rejects the very idea of maternity.
Grace and Hunter are not demons but martyrs, sacrificed to the feminine ideal of motherhood despite their independent desires. The disobedient mother is a horror trope because, as an idealized figure, she has so far to fall, and so many means by which to do so. In comedies like "Bad Moms," unruly mothers use cursing and alcohol. In chillers like "The Lodge" and "Swallow," they guzzle safety pins and play Russian roulette.

Texto completo: Sy Sperling, 78, a businessman who helped bring the hair-loss industry into the mainstream with ubiquitous, self-effacing ads, died Wednesday at a hospital in Boca Raton, Florida.
His death was confirmed by his publicist, Terri Lynn, who said it followed a lengthy illness but did not specify the cause.
Sperling achieved a kind of cult fame in the 1980s, as a late-night commercial for his business, then called the Hair Club for Men, started playing on televisions around the country.
The son of a plumber from the South Bronx, New York, he had no training as an actor and merely stood in a bland room, reciting memorized lines to the camera. But he added a winning kicker.
"Remember," he said, about to hold up an old photo of his own bald pate. "I'm not only the Hair Club president, but I'm also a client."
Calls started pouring in from men interested in his hair-restoration salons, which offered various "weaving systems." Sperling quickly became the face of male hair loss -- however much sat on his head -- and helped pave the way for a booming industry in male health and cosmetics.
Often called the Infomercial King of late-night TV, he appeared in bits on "The Tonight Show" and "Saturday Night Live," stepped into the ring at WrestleMania and made the rounds on TV talk shows and radio for years.
"Even to this day people stop me in the street," he told The Wall Street Journal nearly 30 years after the ad first ran. "People perceive me as the guy next door. My speech is imperfect. My whole TV success had to do with the fact that it was believable and that I was able to afford good TV time by going on late at night."
Seymour Sperling was born in the Bronx, and his father, David, was a plumber, and his mother, Carrie, was a bookkeeper.
He served in the Air Force while attending college before finding work in sales and home improvement. He started his business out of personal need: He had lost most of his hair by the time he was 25, leaving him feeling insecure.
"I was really unhappy with my appearance," he told The New York Times in 1993. "And it was destroying my self-confidence."
With a hair weave, he told the Journal, he felt he could sleep, style his hair and go out on dates without confronting the question that comes with wearing a toupee: "How do you explain, I got to take my hair off now?"
So with about $5,000 and their credit cards, Sperling and his girlfriend at the time -- a hairdresser -- bought a defunct salon in Manhattan. There, they developed a hair-replacement system that used a very fine nylon mesh, adhesives and hair colored to match the customer's.
He told the Times that he wanted to remove some of the stigma around baldness.
"For years, men have felt funny even discussing it, much less trying to do something about it," he said. "I think what I've done is remove some of the embarrassment associated with men wanting to improve their looks."
The commercial that made his career first aired in 1982. It was inspired by titans of industry like Frank Perdue of Perdue Chicken and Victor Kiam of Remington Products, who started appearing in their own ads.
"I said, 'If they could do it with chickens and electric shavers, I'll do one for hair,' " Sperling said in a 2007 documentary, "Roots: The Hair-Raising Story of a Guy Named Sy."
In 2000, Sperling sold his company to a private equity firm for $45 million, and it was eventually acquired by the Japanese company Aderans, which offers hair-loss treatments.
For the next 20 years, he lived in what he called semiretirement, hosting a radio show, giving speeches and helping run a charity, the Hair Club for Kids, which gives hair to children who have lost their own because of chemotherapy, alopecia or other conditions.
In those public events, he never appeared with anything less than a full head of hair -- though he acknowledged that male baldness was no longer considered the blemish it used to be.
But Sperling held firm to the end, his publicist said: "He always remained a Hair Club client."

Help for drowsy drivers

Texto completo: Fatigue comes with the job of driving an 18-wheeler, even with rules requiring rest stops and limiting driving hours. Now, new technologies are becoming available to alert drowsy drivers, sometimes even before they feel tired.
Such tech has been slow to enter big rigs' cabs, but that may be changing.
"The trucking industry is more of a wait-and-see group than an early adopter when it comes to technology because they run on thin margins," said Daniel Bongers, chief technology officer at SmartCap, an Australian company that makes industrial safety products.
In addition, the industry, which employs 3.5 million people in the United States, has been focused on a new law requiring the installation of electronic logging devices on most commercial trucks that is meant to help ensure drivers do not drive more than the legally allotted hours in a day and that they take required breaks.
Biometric sensors are getting lighter, cheaper and more accurate, and new software systems can connect driver and vehicle data. The feedback loops these systems create could make the roads safer for everyone.
Fatigue is highly underreported as an accident cause, said Bongers, who has a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering. For example, he said, a crash might officially be attributed to roadwork, but fatigue may have slowed the driver's reaction time and decision-making.
At National Transportation Services in Kent, Washington, Juan Ochoa, an 18-year industry veteran, manages a fleet of about 80 long-haul trucks. He believes most accidents are caused by fatigue. "I'd estimate 70%," he said.
One of the first drowsy-driving monitoring systems to appear in the truckers' cab was a driver-facing camera that alerted the driver when it registered eyelid and head droops. Privacy concerns kept this technology from going far.
New wearable technology monitors the drivers but in a more subtle way, and comes in a variety of forms, including caps, vests, wristbands and eyewear.
Glasses made by Optalert measure the driver's eye blinking with an LED light monitor. Eyelids that stay down too long might point to a sleepy driver. The real-time measurements are displayed on a dash-mounted device with alarms and notifications.
A headset made by Maven Machines detects if a driver is looking forward through the windshield, up, down or sideways, and measures mirror checks, which can decrease in frequency if a driver is getting tired. The headset detects head bobs and jerks, signs the driver is falling asleep.
This system also notices and can deliver notifications on "coachable" behaviors that can be improved, such as hard braking, and delivers audible routing, weather and other messages. The software behind these devices is complex, with data from a variety of sources, said Craig Campbell, vice president for marketing at Maven Machines.
His company's headset, for example, pulls data from accelerometers embedded inside, sensors in the truck's onboard computer and GPS data from nearby cellphone towers. The system can then discern whether a driver is driving at an unsafe speed, or perhaps just passing someone, going down a hill or crossing a highway overpass that runs above a surface street with a lower speed limit.
"It's easy to drown in a sea of data," so driver-monitoring systems must pick out the important events to report, Campbell said.
The SmartCap device is a headband that fits into trucker caps, beanies or other head gear. The band measures electronic brain waves and translates them to a measure of alertness or fatigue. It notifies the driver and a central monitoring system if the wearer appears drowsy.
The alerts sent to drivers are meant to encourage them to find their own best way to get back into a more alert state, such as stopping and walking around the truck, having a snack, drinking some water or taking a nap, said Bongers. The company says its case studies have shown that over time the number of drivers' alerts lessens, meaning they are changing schedules or learning to recognize their own drowsy warning signs.
Some truck drivers have cameras watching them from dashboard mounts. The Guardian from Seeing Machines, a black cylinder with a camera in it, is mounted on top of the dashboard. Face- and gaze-tracking algorithms monitor the driver and send audio alarms, vibrate the driver's seat and notify the monitoring station if safety parameters are not met.
Ochoa's company uses a camera and software system connected to both the truck and the insurance company for driver safety and monitoring. The system stores 10 seconds of driver and front-facing video before and after any unusual event such as harsh acceleration or braking or sharp turns.
Some devices try to predict drowsiness.
Software sold by Fatigue Science analyzes sleep data from wearables, such as the quality and quantity of a driver's sleep plus their sleep history or sleep debt, in order to project when they will feel tired. This works as a predictive tool, as well as a personal alert system, said Robert Higdon, Fatigue Science's vice president for product and corporate development. The predictions help drivers to be more aware of fatigue risk, he said.
Karen Levy, a Cornell University professor who is writing a book on truckers and technology, said that while she appreciated the safety goals of wearables and cameras, they were "just a Band-Aid" for the wider problem of truck driver fatigue.
Drivers sometimes need to wait hours at warehouse facilities for their cargo to be loaded or unloaded, Levy said. They don't always get paid for that waiting time, "but it does increase their fatigue." Companies should be given incentives to get drivers in and out of loading bays more quickly, she said, and drivers should always be paid for waiting time.

Texto completo: A former North Korean diplomat who fled his embassy posting has become the first defector to run for South Korea's Parliament, saying that he was motivated by Seoul's forced repatriation of two North Korean fishermen who wanted to defect to the South.
"This was so wrong, even if they were criminals," said the former diplomat, Thae Yong Ho, referring to the two North Koreans who were repatriated to the North in November after they were captured in waters off South Korea.
Thae was the No. 2 diplomat in the North Korean Embassy in London when he fled to South Korea with his wife and two sons in 2016.
South Korea's main conservative political opposition, the United Future Party, selected him to run in National Assembly elections in April.
Thae is the first North Korean defector to seek a popularly elected parliamentary seat in the South; another defector sat in Parliament from 2012 to 2016 as an expert nominated by a political party.
On Wednesday, Thae said he had never thought of seeking election until the two North Korean fishermen were sent home against their will.
"I could not sleep that night," he said during a news conference Wednesday.
South Korean navy commandoes seized the two North Koreans from their squid-fishing boat in early November after they had repeatedly resisted an order to surrender, according to South Korean officials.
After their capture, the two confessed that they were running from the law after murdering the captain and 15 other crewmen on their boat, South Korean officials said. They also said they wanted to defect to the South. South Korean authorities decided to treat them not as political refugees but as "heinous criminals."
Blindfolded and tied with ropes, they were escorted to the North Korean border. One collapsed when his blindfold was taken off and he realized that he was about to be handed over to the North, according to South Korean officials and lawmakers familiar with the episode.
Thae compared South Korea's actions to not rescuing a drowning man because he was considered a criminal. The men should have been accepted and then tried under South Korean law, he said.
A government report on the alleged crimes of the two North Koreans remains classified. But according to officials and lawmakers, the ship's boatswain, identified only by his last name, Woo, was the main instigator, persuading another deck hand to join him in killing the captain, who had treated them cruelly, often beating their heads with a food tray.
Eventually, the ship's chief engineer also joined the killing spree, which started late the night of Oct. 30 and continued until early next morning. The killers woke the 15 other crewmen one by one and lured them outside, butchering them with axes, hammers and knives and dumping their bodies into the sea. Officials and lawmakers briefed on the killings called them "scenes from a horror movie."
The three killers then steered their ship back to a North Korean port, hoping to flee inland. But when one of them was caught by the North Korean police, the other two fled to the sea. Their fate in North Korea is unknown, but people convicted of serious crimes there are often executed.
Thae pledged that if he were elected, he would try to enact a law to ensure that South Korea accepted all North Korean asylum-seekers regardless of their criminal backgrounds.
Thae said his candidacy could be eye-opening for members of the North Korean elite working or traveling abroad, who might watch his election campaign through their smartphones and spread the word to isolated relatives back in the North.
It would be a great opportunity to show the North Korean people "how democracy works," he said.

Texto completo: The field marshal stares from billboards into the wreckage of the Libyan city of Benghazi. His uniform is festooned with epaulets and honors, even as the civil war he is waging has stalled into a bloody stalemate.
His plainclothes security agents loiter and listen in cafes and hotel lobbies. He has handed control of the mosques to extremist preachers. And he has showered patronage on a tribal death squad called the Avengers of Blood, blamed for a long string of disappearances and killings of his political opponents.
"We are living in a prison," said Ahmed Sharkasi, a liberal activist from Benghazi who fled to Tunis because of threats on his life.
Khalifa Hifter, the 76-year-old commander known in his dominion as "the marshal," is the military ruler of eastern Libya. He has been fighting for nearly six years to take control of the country, and he has been waging an assault on the capital, Tripoli, for the past 10 months.
The United Arab Emirates, Egypt and others have lined up behind him, and Russia has sent mercenaries. The largely powerless United Nations-sponsored government in Tripoli is defended mainly by regional militias and, recently, Turkey, which has flown in hundreds of paid Syrian fighters.
Hifter has cut off Libya's oil production for the past month to try to deprive the Tripoli government of revenue. Last week he began shelling its civilian port, killing three people, narrowly missing a ship loaded with liquefied natural gas and derailing United Nations-sponsored cease-fire talks.
Hifter has promised to build a stable, democratic and secular Libya, but he has largely shut Western journalists out of his territory. A rare visit there by a New York Times correspondent and photographer revealed an unwieldy authoritarianism that in many ways is both more puritanical and more lawless than Libya was under its last dictator, Moammar Gadhafi.
Hifter's Benghazi stronghold is a half-ruined city beset by corruption, where security agents trailed foreign journalists, residents cowered in fear of arbitrary arrest, and pro-government militias answered to no one.
Aging and distracted, Hifter is seldom seen in Benghazi. He presides from his mountain home an hour's drive to the west. He holds salons with tribal elders and depends on family as his closest advisers. Two of his sons are among his top military commanders, as well as his caretakers.
"They make sure he is well fed," said Faraj Najem, a director of a government-run research center who is close to Hifter. "They make sure he takes his medicine. They provide him with security when they are around him."
The center of Benghazi is little different today than it was in 2017, when Hifter seized it after a four-year campaign of shelling and bombing.
Neighborhoods on the periphery now bustle with newly opened stores and cafes. But the streets of the city center are crumbling.
Libya is rich with oil, but it is a volatile prize. It has been in turmoil since an Arab Spring revolt and NATO's intervention toppled Gadhafi nine years ago. Its deserts shelter Islamist militants, and its Mediterranean coastline teems with migrants.
Hifter had served as an officer in Gadhafi's army but later fled to the United States where he lived for decades as a CIA client before returning to Libya during the uprising in 2011.
He began his drive for power by promising to save Benghazi. In 2014, when Islamist militias were terrorizing the city, he vowed to declare military rule and rid the country of Islamists.
Armed by foreign sponsors, he started by recruiting fighters from local tribes and welcoming the help of former Gadhafi officers and officials.
Then he won the support of Saudi-style Islamist fighters -- known as Salafists -- who saw a common enemy in the rival schools of Islamists that Hifter was battling. He has never acknowledged any contradiction between his avowed hostility to political Islam and his brigades of Salafists.
The deals he struck with tribal militias, Salafists and former Gadhafi henchmen in Benghazi now threaten to run over his promises of secular law and order.
Many Benghazi residents celebrate Hifter for restoring security to the streets, an attitude reinforced in his official media. Images of Hifter's face are ubiquitous. A pro-Hifter satellite television network broadcasts his propaganda and sometimes Salafist sermons. Weekly street demonstrations, organized by the government's Office of Supporting Decisions, recall Gadhafi-era displays of forced enthusiasm.
Access to Benghazi by foreign journalists or rights groups is severely restricted. Residents must obtain official permission to travel abroad, sometimes requiring interrogation by security agents. Some are forced to submit reports about who they met outside Libya -- or, sometimes, on friends and neighbors at home.
Opposition views are not welcome.
In July, a British-educated politician, Seham Sergiwa, 57, publicly questioned Hifter's assault on Tripoli. A group of armed men abducted her that night. They spray-painted a warning against criticizing the army on the wall of her house.
Her relatives outside Libya said the power was cut before the attack and police had ignored calls for help. Most family members now believe she is dead. But Benghazi authorities have told her husband that they believe she is alive and advised him to keep quiet.
"All the evidence points to Hifter," said her brother, Adam Sergiwa, a doctor living in Indiana. "We know that. Everybody knows that. He wanted to teach a lesson."
A spokesman for Hifter called the apparent killing an act of terrorism and said that his military had nothing to do with it.
Although no longer a battleground, Benghazi is hardly free of violence.
U.N. reports warn of frequent kidnappings, forced disappearances and assassinations by unknown assailants.
Responsibility for the violence is impossible to determine, but many Benghazi residents point to tribal militias that fought with Hifter.
One of the biggest sources of fighters was the Awaqir tribe. Members of the tribe now boast of their impunity, and some have claimed prime jobs in government-owned companies or even the local university.
Awaqirs formed the Avengers of Blood in 2013 to seek revenge after a deadly clash with an Islamist-leaning militia. The Avengers became known as enforcers for Hifter, widely blamed for disappearances and killings.
A spokesman for Hifter said the Avengers were unarmed civilians who collected info about "terrorists."
But during the abduction of Sergiwa, her attackers scrawled the name of the Avengers of Blood on the wall.

Texto completo: Lawrence Tesler, a pioneering computer scientist who in his work at Xerox and with Steve Jobs at Apple devoted himself to making it easier for users to interact with computers, died Feb. 16 at his home in Portola Valley, California. He was 74.
His wife, Colleen Barton, said that there was no known cause of death, but that in recent years Tesler had suffered the effects of an earlier bicycle accident.
During his career Tesler worked at a number of Silicon Valley's most important companies. But it was as a young researcher at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970s that he did his most significant work, helping to develop today's style of computer interaction based on a graphical desktop metaphor and a mouse.
Early in his Xerox career (he began there in 1973), working with another researcher, Tim Mott, Tesler developed a program known as Gypsy, which did away with the restrictive modes that had made text editing complicated. For example, until Gypsy, most text-editing software had one mode for entering text and another for editing it.
Tesler was passionate about simplifying interaction with computers. At Apple he was responsible for the idea that a computer mouse should have only one button. For many years the license plate on his car read, "NO MODES."
At Xerox PARC, his first breakthrough came when he took a newly hired secretary, sat her in front of a blank computer monitor and took notes while she described how she would prefer to compose documents with a computer. She proceeded to describe a very simple system, which Tesler then implemented with Mott.
The Gypsy program contained such innovations as the "cut and paste" analogy for moving blocks of text and the ability to select text by dragging the cursor through it while holding down a mouse button. It also shared with an earlier Xerox editor, Bravo, what became known as "what you see is what you get" or WYSIWYG printing, a phrase Tesler used to describe a computer display that mirrored printed output.
And it implemented the idea of opening a computer file by simply clicking on a screen icon while pointing at it with the mouse cursor. Before that, files had to be opened by typing the file name into a command line.
"At Xerox he pushed a lot for things to be simpler in ways that would broaden the base of users," said David Liddle, a veteran Silicon Valley venture capitalist who worked with Tesler at Xerox PARC. "He was always quite focused on users who weren't also Ph.D.s in computer science."
He continued to advocate for less costly computers. In 1978, with Adele Goldberg and Douglas Fairbairn, he designed a portable machine called NoteTaker, a forerunner of luggable computers like the Osborne, Kaypro and Compaq machines of the early 1980s. But Xerox declined to commercialize the NoteTaker; only a few prototypes were made.
It was Tesler who gave Steve Jobs the celebrated demonstration of the Xerox Alto computer and the Smalltalk software system that would come to influence the design of first Apple's Lisa personal computer and then its Macintosh.
Tesler left Xerox to work for Jobs at Apple in 1980.
Tesler left Apple in 1997 for a startup and later went on to work for both Amazon and Yahoo. He left Yahoo in 2008 and spent a year as a product fellow at 23andMe, the genetics information company. He was most recently an independent consultant.
Lawrence Gordon Tesler was born in the Bronx on April 24, 1945, to Isidore and Muriel (Krechman) Tesler. His father was an anesthesiologist.
At Stanford, where Tesler studied mathematics, he was involved in a number of early projects that prefigured personal computing. He had early access to a computer known as a LINC when he worked as a student programmer for the Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg. The LINC, designed by the MIT physicist Wesley A. Clark, is believed by many computer historians to have been the first true personal computer.
Tesler's first startup venture was a programming consulting company located in a mall adjacent to the Stanford campus.
In addition to Barton, a geophysicist, and his daughter, Lisa Tesler, he is survived by two brothers, Charles and Alan.

Heavy future Half of American adults will face obesity, dire projections show

Texto completo: Climate change is not the only source of dire projections for the coming decade. Perhaps just as terrifying from both a health and an economic perspective is a predicted continued rise in obesity, including severe obesity, among American adults.
A prestigious team of medical scientists has projected that by 2030, nearly 1 in 2 adults will be obese, and nearly 1 in 4 will be severely obese. The estimates are thought to be particularly reliable, as the team corrected for underestimates of weight given by individuals in national surveys. In as many as 29 states, the prevalence of obesity will exceed 50%, with no state having less than 35% of residents who are obese, they predicted.
Likewise, the team projected, in 25 states the prevalence of severe obesity will be higher than one adult in four, and severe obesity will become the most common weight category among women, non-Hispanic black adults and low-income adults nationally.
Given the role obesity plays in fostering many chronic, disabling and often fatal diseases, these are dire predictions indeed. Yet, as with climate change, the powers that be in this country are doing very little to head off the potentially disastrous results, obesity specialists say.
Efforts like limiting access to huge portions of sugar-sweetened soda, the scientists note, are effectively thwarted by industries able to dwarf the effect of educational efforts by health departments that have comparatively minuscule budgets. With rare exceptions, the sugar and beverage industries have blocked nearly every attempt to add an excise tax to sugar-sweetened beverages.
Claims that such a tax is regressive and unfairly targets low-income people are shortsighted, according to Zachary J. Ward, public health specialist at Harvard and the lead author of the new report, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in December.
"What people would save in health care costs would dwarf the extra money paid as taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages," he said in an interview.
In Philadelphia, where a soda tax of 1.5 cents an ounce took effect three years ago, total purchases declined by 38% even after accounting for beverages bought outside the city, his co-author Sara Bleich said.
However, she quickly added, piecemeal changes like this are not enough to make a significant difference in the obesity forecast for the country. Rather, nationwide changes are needed in the ubiquitous food environment. As the new report clearly demonstrated, Americans weren't always this fat; since 1990, the prevalence of obesity in this country has doubled.
People who blame genetics are fooling no one but themselves, Ward said. Our genetics haven't changed in the last 30 years. What has changed is the environment in which our genes now function.
"Food is very cheap in the United States, and super easy to access," said Bleich, a professor of public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. We eat out more, consuming more foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt, and our portion sizes are bigger.
As Ward noted: "You don't even have to leave home to eat restaurant-prepared food - just call and it will be delivered."
As a society, we also snack more, a habit that starts as soon as toddlers can feed themselves.
"People are snacking throughout the day," Ward said. "Snacking is the normal thing to do in the United States. In France, you never see anyone eating on a bus."
We also eat more highly pro-cessed foods, which have been shown to foster weight gain, thanks to their usually high levels of calories, sugar and fat.
A recent study showed that even when controlling for weight, consuming lots of processed foods raises the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.
"It doesn't take that many extra calories to result in weight gain," Bleich said. "Through marketing, we're constantly being sold on foods we didn't even know we wanted. We're all about immediate rewards. We're not thinking about the future, which is why we're going to see more than half the population obese in 10 years."
Unless something is done to reverse this trend, Ward said, "Obesity will be the new normal in this country. We're living in an obesogenic environment."
"While there's no one thing to throw at the problem," Bleich said, "if I could wave a magic wand, I'd make a tax on beverages a federal mandate because they're the largest source of added sugar in the diet and are strongly linked to weight gain and health problems. When people drink their calories, they don't feel as full as when they consume solid food, so they end up eating more."
This may also be true for calorie-free sweet drinks. Although the jury is still out on cause and effect, the link between beverage consumption and greater intake of calories may also apply to drinks flavored with no-calorie or low-calorie sweeteners.
With a third of meals now being eaten out, Bleich suggested that prompting restaurants to gradually, surreptitiously reduce the amount of fat, sugar and calories in the meals they serve could help put the brakes on societal weight gain. "Menus could make healthier, lower-calorie meals the default option," she said.
Controlling portion sizes is another critically important step. "Big portions are especially motivating for low-income people who reasonably want to get more calories for their dollar," she said. Low-income groups already have the highest rates of obesity and, the new projections show, they are most likely to experience a rising prevalence of obesity and severe obesity.
"From a policy perspective," Ward said, "prevention is the way to go. Children aren't born obese, but we can already see excessive weight gain as early as age 2. Changes in the food environment are needed at every level - local, state and federal. It's hard for individuals to voluntarily change their behavior."

Texto completo: BENGHAZI, Libya - The field marshal stares from billboards into the wreckage of the Libyan city of Benghazi. His uniform is festooned with epaulets and honors, even as the civil war he is waging has stalled into a bloody stalemate.
His plainclothes security agents loiter and listen in cafes and hotel lobbies. He has handed control of the mosques to extremist preachers. And he has showered patronage on a tribal death squad called the Avengers of Blood, blamed for a long string of disappearances and killings of his political opponents.
"We are living in a prison," said Ahmed Sharkasi, a liberal activist from Benghazi who fled to Tunis because of threats on his life.
Khalifa Hifter, the 76-year-old commander known in his dominion as "the marshal," is the military ruler of eastern Libya. He has been fighting for nearly six years to take control of the country, and he has been waging an assault on the capital, Tripoli, for the past 10 months.
The United Arab Emirates, Egypt and others have lined up behind him, and Russia has sent mercenaries. The largely powerless United Nations-sponsored government in Tripoli is defended mainly by regional militias and, recently, Turkey, which has flown in hundreds of paid Syrian fighters.
Hifter has cut off Libya's oil production for the past month to try to deprive the Tripoli government of revenue. Last week he began shelling its civilian port, killing three people, narrowly missing a ship loaded with liquefied natural gas and derailing United Nations-sponsored cease-fire talks.
Hifter has promised to build a stable, democratic and secular Libya, but he has largely shut Western journalists out of his territory. A rare visit there by a New York Times correspondent and photographer revealed an unwieldy authoritarianism that in many ways is both more puritanical and more lawless than Libya was under its last dictator, Moammar Gadhafi.
Hifter's Benghazi stronghold is a half-ruined city beset by corruption, where security agents trailed foreign journalists, residents cowered in fear of arbitrary arrest, and pro-government militias answered to no one.
Aging and distracted, Hifter is seldom seen in Benghazi. He presides from his mountain home an hour's drive to the west. He holds salons with tribal elders and depends on family as his closest advisers. Two of his sons are among his top military commanders, as well as his caretakers.
"They make sure he is well fed," said Faraj Najem, a director of a government-run research center who is close to Hifter. "They make sure he takes his medicine. They provide him with security when they are around him."
The center of Benghazi is little different today than it was in 2017, when Hifter seized it after a four-year campaign of shelling and bombing.
Neighborhoods on the periphery now bustle with newly opened stores and cafes. But the streets of the city center are crumbling.
Libya is rich with oil, but it is a volatile prize. It has been in turmoil since an Arab Spring revolt and NATO's intervention toppled Gadhafi nine years ago. Its deserts shelter Islamist militants, and its Mediterranean coastline teems with migrants.
Hifter had served as an officer in Gadhafi's army but later fled to the United States where he lived for decades as a CIA client before returning to Libya during the uprising in 2011.
He began his drive for power by promising to save Benghazi. In 2014, when Islamist militias were terrorizing the city, he vowed to declare military rule and rid the country of Islamists.
Armed by foreign sponsors, he started by recruiting fighters from local tribes and welcoming the help of former Gadhafi officers and officials.
Then he won the support of Saudi-style Islamist fighters - known as Salafists - who saw a common enemy in the rival schools of Islamists that Hifter was battling. He has never acknowledged any contradiction between his avowed hostility to political Islam and his brigades of Salafists.
The deals he struck with tribal militias, Salafists and former Gadhafi henchmen in Benghazi now threaten to run over his promises of secular law and order.
Many Benghazi residents celebrate Hifter for restoring security to the streets, an attitude reinforced in his official media. Images of Hifter's face are ubiquitous. A pro-Hifter satellite television network broadcasts his propaganda and sometimes Salafist sermons. Weekly street demonstrations, organized by the government's Office of Supporting Decisions, recall Gadhafi-era displays of forced enthusiasm.
Access to Benghazi by foreign journalists or rights groups is severely restricted. Residents must obtain official permission to travel abroad, sometimes requiring interrogation by security agents. Some are forced to submit reports about who they met outside Libya - or, sometimes, on friends and neighbors at home.
Opposition views are not welcome.
In July, a British-educated politician, Seham Sergiwa, 57, publicly questioned Hifter's assault on Tripoli. A group of armed men abducted her that night. They spray-painted a warning against criticizing the army on the wall of her house.
Her relatives outside Libya said the power was cut before the attack and police had ignored calls for help. Most family members now believe she is dead. But Benghazi authorities have told her husband that they believe she is alive and advised him to keep quiet.
"All the evidence points to Hifter," said her brother, Adam Sergiwa, a doctor living in Indiana. "We know that. Everybody knows that. He wanted to teach a lesson."
A spokesman for Hifter called the apparent killing an act of terrorism and said that his military had nothing to do with it.
Although no longer a battleground, Benghazi is hardly free of violence.
U.N. reports warn of frequent kidnappings, forced disappearances and assassinations by unknown assailants.
Responsibility for the violence is impossible to determine, but many Benghazi residents point to tribal militias that fought with Hifter.
One of the biggest sources of fighters was the Awaqir tribe. Members of the tribe now boast of their impunity, and some have claimed prime jobs in government-owned companies or even the local university.
Awaqirs formed the Avengers of Blood in 2013 to seek revenge after a deadly clash with an Islamist-leaning militia. The Avengers became known as enforcers for Hifter, widely blamed for disappearances and killings.
A spokesman for Hifter said the Avengers were unarmed civilians who collected info about "terrorists."
But during the abduction of Sergiwa, her attackers scrawled the name of the Avengers of Blood on the wall.

Texto completo: Tiffany Ruiz had tried various gyms, apps, workout routines and diets, all in an effort to get fit and lose some weight. "None of them worked because none of them kept my interest," she said.
Now, Ruiz is working out at least four times a week, thanks to a video game.
In her bedroom, she sprints, squats, stretches and performs other exercises like knee lifts and shoulder presses, all while battling a muscle-bound dragon and its toadies in "Ring Fit Adventure," a new game from Nintendo, the Japanese consumer tech giant.
"I am so focused on beating the high score or conquering an enemy that before I know it, 30 minutes have passed," said Ruiz, 26, who is studying to become a nursing assistant in Bakersfield, California.
"Ring Fit Adventure," created for the Nintendo Switch console, is the latest effort by the video game industry to try to entice consumers to get up off the couch and become more active.
Developers are folding fitness into games as part of a dual-pronged strategy: to retain players by offering a physical twist on traditional gameplay and to draw in new ones like Ruiz who are looking to break up the monotony of working out.
"Developers are trying to reach people who want fun and fitness at the same time," said Rik Eberhardt, a program manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Game Lab. "They know fitness is good for them, but it can feel like a chore in their busy lives."
Fitness games make up just 1% of the market, but the overall industry is steadily growing. Sales of games across all platforms generated $35.4 billion in the United States last year, up 2% from 2018, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.
"Exergaming," a portmanteau of exercise and gaming, has been around since the late 1980s, when Bandai introduced Power Pad, a gray mat with pressure sensors, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Games now use motion sensors, smartwatches and even virtual reality to track a player's movement.
Some games disguise fitness routines in the form of role-playing, dancing or other activities like running from zombies. Others are fitness and health apps that lead users through workouts with scoreboards, real-time feedback and multiplayer options. Nintendo's Wii game console brought exergaming into the mainstream in 2006. Its "Wii Fit" game incorporated a balance board so players burned calories through calisthenics and yoga.
"The Wii had the fastest adoption rate in the U.S. of any console in the first three years," Mat Piscatella, an industry analyst for NPD, said. "Wii Fit" remains one of the bestselling games in the United States, according to NPD.
Nintendo's two main competitors, Microsoft and Sony, followed its lead, adding motion-detecting cameras to their consoles. Games like "Just Dance" and "Zumba Fitness: Join the Party," which were available on Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony consoles, were "breakout successes" in the motion era, Piscatella said.
Since then, the industry has been overturned by the rise of mobile devices, which allow games to be played on the go.
Exergames are not without risks, said Eefje Battel, a project manager at the Sports Innovation Campus at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Bruges, Belgium. One element missing in "Ring Fit," she said, is a coach to ensure that players are performing exercises correctly and safely.
"If you are squatting, the system will measure movement up and down, but it won't track posture," she said.

Coronavirus On campus, fears cause the wrong reactions

Texto completo: It's been a hard year to be a student from China studying in the United States.
Between the Hong Kong protests, the trade war, and persistent fears aboutvisas, what may have started out as a fun and exciting study-abroad experience was already somewhatfraught and confusing.
But few anticipated how acutely the effects of coronavirus would be felt here, in Connecticut - even though not a single case has been identified.
It started last fall, as mainland students arrived to American campuses, happy to be back among friends, only to discover that they were treated with suspicion.
All summer, stories of heroic pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong filled American newspapers and Facebook feeds. Almost uniformly, our press painted the Beijing government as a tyrannous enemy and its citizens as complicit. When mainland students got to campus, sympathies heavily favored their compatriots from Hong Kong, but their own feelings about events were very complex - their American education led them to appreciate the value of democracy, but they didn't like the racism, violence and nationalism on display.
On campuses across the country and, indeed, around the world, events related to Hong Kong drew large crowds, generated high emotions and sometimes resulted in violence. We at Wesleyan were lucky. We too talked about the protests, but we did so in a way where all views were heard and respected. Students from the mainland were encouraged to share their perspectives, and Hong Kong students not only listened but also revealed that the conflict on in the territories was not simply a black-and-white, David vs. Goliath situation but actually was very complicated with many divergent and often conflicting points of view.
We not only held events featuring Hong Kong voices but also crafted safe ways for mainlanders to share their stories as well. They told heart-wrenching tales of internal conflict, torn families, struggles with immigration and experiences with racism. We all learned and grew from these conversations. By the winter break, tensions had eased, productive conversations were germinating and students could get back to being students - worrying about final exams, starting job searches and planning family holidays.
Then came the coronavirus, now called COVID-19. Once again, mainland students returning to campus were viewed with suspicion, especially after one student was monitored for the virus. Friends, professors, and supervisors kept their distance from Asian students, treating the whole community as if it were somehow infected. Never mind that very few (if any?) of our students come from Wuhan. Never mind that the chances that an American student would catch the flu from their school-age sibling was many thousands times more likely than that they would catch COVID-19 from anyone.
Being discriminated against wasn't enough; the uncertainty about the virus and the distrust of the official information coming out of China compounded the problem as Chinese students (from the mainland and Hong Kong alike) feared for family members and friends back home.
Weeks have now passed, and no one on campus has had the virus. In fact, no one in all of Connecticut has been infected to date. As it turns out, among the 15 million people or so who live in New England, there has been only 1 case and zero deaths among the handful of cases in the whole country. To put this in perspective, this year already there have been 26 million cases of the flu in the United States and more than 14,000 deaths.
As a community, we are not being rational. People are avoiding their favorite Chinese restaurants but are forgetting to wash their hands when visiting libraries, schools and church.
When reports of this discriminatory behavior reached me, I implored my colleagues to take three steps to help ensure that ours is a community that is welcoming and not practicing racial profiling: 1) Double-check your own behavior to make sure that you're not treating Asian people as if they're somehow contaminated. 2) Gently intervene if you witness others acting in that way. 3) If possible, take opportunities to talk about the problem of racial discrimination with others to reinforce our collective commitment to being a welcoming community.
Many of my colleagues responded to my call with dismay, sad that this was happening on our campus. One very brave soul wrote with a confession - she realized after getting my email that she had unconsciously and unintentionally been treating her Chinese students differently. She felt guilty and vowed to change her behavior.
There are thousands of Chinese and Chinese-Americans in Connecticut who may have families who are directly affected. They are scared enough for their loved ones who live far away. We cannot heal people on the other side of the planet, but we can offer compassion and support to our friends and neighbors here.
Let's not act out of irrational fear and instead build the kinds of communities in which we want to live.

Have you hired a hustler? How about a hipster or hacker?

Texto completo: How does your company stack up when considering these pivotal personalities?
From the local barbershop to the giant, multinational corporation, businesses of all shapes and sizes desperately want one thing: growth. Regardless of industry, geography, or scale, a company's ability to grow is directly linked to the inherent enterprise value.
In working closely with organizations around the world, I've noticed that the ones who really savor consistent growth have three critical archetypes in their leadership ranks: The Hipster, The Hustler, and The Hacker. In smaller companies, a single person may have two or three of these traits. In larger businesses, each role may be filled by an entire team. But if you're missing one or more of these mission-critical personality types, you're undercutting your ability to grow. Let's examine each of them:
The Hipster. Our first key role understands the times. They're up to speed with new trends, know what's relevant and what's yesterday's news, and is deeply connected with the zeitgeist of the day. The Hipster ensures the organization is catering to today's — and tomorrow's — customer needs, helping to avoid complacency and ultimately irrelevance. Picking up on subtle cues and understanding the convergence of macro-trends, it's the business equivalent of being fashion-forward.
The Hustler. Every business needs a promoter, and hopefully yours has the wizardry of legendary boxing promoter Don King. Ensuring that the message cuts through the noise to customers, investors and employees, this person paints a compelling vision and communicates with passion. The role may be a traditional rainmaking role such as VP of Sales or Chief Marketing Officer, or it could be something more progressive such as Chief Evangelist. Someone has to really embrace the core message, and then scream it from the mountaintops.
The Hacker. What organization can grow without a figure-it-out czar? Business is all about tackling insurmountable challenges in creative ways — from sales and marketing obstacles, to production and manufacturing pitfalls. The Hacker believes that every code can be cracked, wasting no time saying it can't be done. Deconstructing existing approaches, defying traditions and sticking a finger in the eye of conventional wisdom are the hallmarks of this important role.
How does your company stack up when considering these pivotal personalities? If you're down one, it's time to recruit or promote quickly. If you lack two or more, you're in danger of stalling or losing ground. Instead of ensuring traditional roles such as CFO, CMO and CIO fill your leadership ranks, make sure you've got these three growth drivers staffed with A-plus talent.
Your biggest leaps forward in growth will occur with the formidable combination of The Hipster, The Hustler and The Hacker.

Texto completo: Once you give up integrity, it's easy to give up everything else.
Back during the scandal over his sexual exploitation of a young intern, Bill Clinton was pilloried in this space for his moral defects.
To which many liberals responded with derision. Morality? What did that matter? The economy was good, we were at peace and Clinton was hardly the first man to fool around and lie about it. As one reader put it, he was hired to be a president, not a pope.
At the time, that felt like a rationalization. A generation later, it feels like a portent. Indeed, it is often said that we are living now in Post-Fact America but truth is, we are also living in Post-Integrity America.
No, that's not breaking news. But it's been brought into painfully clear focus these last few days.
One watched – not with surprise anymore, the capacity for that being long lost, but surely with dread and fascination – as Donald Trump launched his post-impeachment purge of aides deemed insufficiently sycophantic. But that was just a prelude.
Last week, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 people, most of them guilty of lying, fraud, corruption, tax evasion and similar crimes. In other words, the kinds of things of which Trump has often been accused.
The power to soften or wipe away criminal convictions is one of the nicer perks of the presidency, allowing compassion to be shown to those who deserve it. And in fairness, several of those who benefited last week seem to meet that standard. Crystal Munoz, for instance, had been sentenced to almost 20 years for dealing pot.
But it is worth noting that every person Trump pardoned or gave clemency came to his attention not through the normal machinery of government, but through inside connections or else, as The New York Times noted, "were promoted on Fox News." Some were championed by aides and allies. Some had donated big money to his campaign. And again, most had breached the public trust.
Like former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who had served eight years of a 14-year sentence for trying to sell Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat. Trump, who has opined how unfair it is that U.S. companies are not allowed to pay bribes to do business overseas, had called that sentence "ridiculous."
It's no great leap to suggest that he sees himself in Blagojevich. Or in former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and financier Michael Milken, whom he pardoned for tax fraud and securities fraud, respectively. If granting clemency and pardons opens a window upon a president's moral priorities – and it does – the view offered here suggests an unfortunate affinity for scammers and grifters, an empathy for those on the make, cutting deals, cutting corners, living the dream, until they got caught up by pesky rules designed to enforce integrity. And if those same people happened to give him money or had their names whispered into his ear by a friend, so much the better.
That's not how this is supposed to work. And that it is working this way right out in the open, before our very eyes, suggests – no, screams – Trump's imperviousness to any sense of ethical affront.
During Clinton's scandal, it was argued in this space that a president stamps himself upon an era "not simply by legislative accomplishment, but also ... by dint of personal authority and moral suasion."
Trump disproves that. He has stamped himself upon this era while ignoring the very idea of personal authority or moral suasion – and daring us to care. But we had better. By his lack of personal character, Trump threatens our national character. And he stamps this era with the signature lesson of his life:
Once you give up integrity, it's easy to give up everything else.

Texto completo: BENGHAZI, Libya - The field marshal stares from billboards into the wreckage of the Libyan city of Benghazi. His uniform is festooned with epaulets and honors, even as the civil war he is waging has stalled into a bloody stalemate.
His plainclothes security agents loiter and listen in cafes and hotel lobbies. He has handed control of the mosques to extremist preachers. And he has showered patronage on a tribal death squad called the Avengers of Blood, blamed for a long string of disappearances and killings of his political opponents.
"We are living in a prison," said Ahmed Sharkasi, a liberal activist from Benghazi who fled to Tunis because of threats on his life.
Khalifa Hifter, the 76-year-old commander known in his dominion as "the marshal," is the military ruler of eastern Libya. He has been fighting for nearly six years to take control of the country, and he has been waging an assault on the capital, Tripoli, for the past 10 months.
The United Arab Emirates, Egypt and others have lined up behind him, and Russia has sent mercenaries. The largely powerless United Nations-sponsored government in Tripoli is defended mainly by regional militias and, recently, Turkey, which has flown in hundreds of paid Syrian fighters.
Hifter has cut off Libya's oil production for the past month to try to deprive the Tripoli government of revenue. Last week he began shelling its civilian port, killing three people, narrowly missing a ship loaded with liquefied natural gas and derailing United Nations-sponsored cease-fire talks.
Hifter has promised to build a stable, democratic and secular Libya, but he has largely shut Western journalists out of his territory. A rare visit there by a New York Times correspondent and photographer revealed an unwieldy authoritarianism that in many ways is both more puritanical and more lawless than Libya was under its last dictator, Moammar Gadhafi.
Hifter's Benghazi stronghold is a half-ruined city beset by corruption, where security agents trailed foreign journalists, residents cowered in fear of arbitrary arrest, and pro-government militias answered to no one.
Aging and distracted, Hifter is seldom seen in Benghazi. He presides from his mountain home an hour's drive to the west. He holds salons with tribal elders and depends on family as his closest advisers. Two of his sons are among his top military commanders, as well as his caretakers.
"They make sure he is well fed," said Faraj Najem, a director of a government-run research center who is close to Hifter. "They make sure he takes his medicine. They provide him with security when they are around him."
The center of Benghazi is little different today than it was in 2017, when Hifter seized it after a four-year campaign of shelling and bombing.
Neighborhoods on the periphery now bustle with newly opened stores and cafes. But the streets of the city center are crumbling.
Libya is rich with oil, but it is a volatile prize. It has been in turmoil since an Arab Spring revolt and NATO's intervention toppled Gadhafi nine years ago. Its deserts shelter Islamist militants, and its Mediterranean coastline teems with migrants.
Hifter had served as an officer in Gadhafi's army but later fled to the United States where he lived for decades as a CIA client before returning to Libya during the uprising in 2011.
He began his drive for power by promising to save Benghazi. In 2014, when Islamist militias were terrorizing the city, he vowed to declare military rule and rid the country of Islamists.
Armed by foreign sponsors, he started by recruiting fighters from local tribes and welcoming the help of former Gadhafi officers and officials.
Then he won the support of Saudi-style Islamist fighters - known as Salafists - who saw a common enemy in the rival schools of Islamists that Hifter was battling. He has never acknowledged any contradiction between his avowed hostility to political Islam and his brigades of Salafists.
The deals he struck with tribal militias, Salafists and former Gadhafi henchmen in Benghazi now threaten to run over his promises of secular law and order.
Many Benghazi residents celebrate Hifter for restoring security to the streets, an attitude reinforced in his official media. Images of Hifter's face are ubiquitous. A pro-Hifter satellite television network broadcasts his propaganda and sometimes Salafist sermons. Weekly street demonstrations, organized by the government's Office of Supporting Decisions, recall Gadhafi-era displays of forced enthusiasm.
Access to Benghazi by foreign journalists or rights groups is severely restricted. Residents must obtain official permission to travel abroad, sometimes requiring interrogation by security agents. Some are forced to submit reports about who they met outside Libya - or, sometimes, on friends and neighbors at home.
Opposition views are not welcome.
In July, a British-educated politician, Seham Sergiwa, 57, publicly questioned Hifter's assault on Tripoli. A group of armed men abducted her that night. They spray-painted a warning against criticizing the army on the wall of her house.
Her relatives outside Libya said the power was cut before the attack and police had ignored calls for help. Most family members now believe she is dead. But Benghazi authorities have told her husband that they believe she is alive and advised him to keep quiet.
"All the evidence points to Hifter," said her brother, Adam Sergiwa, a doctor living in Indiana. "We know that. Everybody knows that. He wanted to teach a lesson."
A spokesman for Hifter called the apparent killing an act of terrorism and said that his military had nothing to do with it.
Although no longer a battleground, Benghazi is hardly free of violence.
U.N. reports warn of frequent kidnappings, forced disappearances and assassinations by unknown assailants.
Responsibility for the violence is impossible to determine, but many Benghazi residents point to tribal militias that fought with Hifter.
One of the biggest sources of fighters was the Awaqir tribe. Members of the tribe now boast of their impunity, and some have claimed prime jobs in government-owned companies or even the local university.
Awaqirs formed the Avengers of Blood in 2013 to seek revenge after a deadly clash with an Islamist-leaning militia. The Avengers became known as enforcers for Hifter, widely blamed for disappearances and killings.
A spokesman for Hifter said the Avengers were unarmed civilians who collected info about "terrorists."
But during the abduction of Sergiwa, her attackers scrawled the name of the Avengers of Blood on the wall.

Newish Jewish IN OUR MIDST

Texto completo: In the spacious, blue-carpeted sanctuary of New Haven's Beth El-Keser Israel synagogue, an audience of 70 gathers to hear the authors of "The Newish Jewish Encyclopedia" - "three brilliant young Jewish thinkers," says the congregant introducing them, "including our own Mark Oppenheimer."
Sitting onstage with co-authors Stephanie Butnick and Liel Leibovitz, and sporting button-down shirt, bow tie, horn rims and sweater vest, Oppenheimer - editor, author, memoirist, Yale lecturer, 40-ish father of five and New Haven resident - gives off a faintly dandyish, handsome-nerd vibe. The three writers met while working for Tablet, the Jewish news and culture magazine; in 2015 they started a weekly podcast, "Unorthodox," dedicated to conversations about all things Jewish.
"Unorthodox" has won acclaim for its mix of the serious and the lighthearted, and Oppenheimer is that way himself, shifting effortlessly from English-lit mode to standup comic. "Every Jew feels a kind of impostor syndrome," he tells his appreciative audience. "Everyone thinks, 'I have no right to this tradition.'" There's no real analogue to this feeling among Christians, Oppenheimer notes with a chuckle. "There's nobody who thinks, 'God, I'd like to be a Presbyterian, but it's really so complicated.'"
"The Newish Jewish Encyclopedia" attempts to address this complication. A collection of "Jewish stuff" assembled by non-experts for non-experts, it's intended both for Jews and for non-Jews interested in Jewish life. The book acknowledges a daunting diversity - American Jewry is anything but monolithic, Butnick notes - while daring what Leibovitz calls "the fanatically ridiculous task" of being, well, encyclopedic about Jewish life. "The Talmud itself has 42 volumes," says Leibovitz, "and here we are, writing 250 pages?"
More than a few entries are witty one-liners, like the one for "foreskin" ("How would we know?"), or for Google founder Sergei Brin ("Google him."). The authors wax irreverent about even the most fraught topics. Thus the entry for "Adolf" notes that Nazis spelled the name with an f, American journalists with a ph, but that "whatever the spelling, it's not a good baby name anymore."
"We definitely had fun with this book," Oppenheimer confesses. "But we also wanted it to be a teaching tool." Indeed, a browse through the encyclopedia yields any number of things you didn't know - for example, that equatorial Kenya is home to an enclave of messianic African Jews known as the Kasuku Jews. There are entries on Purim and other, lesser-known holidays, and compact histories of Poland, the garment industry and the Jewish deli. There are stand-alone sections under such headings as "Sports and Jews," "Jewish Gangsters," "How to Curse in Jewish" and "Holocaust Movies: A Guide." "Booze and Jews - Perfect Pairings" recommends Moscato wine with a chocolate babka, and vodka with pickled herring.
The encyclopedia contains witty pop-culture observations, including this observation about The Grateful Dead's popularity among Jews: "The Dead's infinite catalogue of bootleg concerts feels like an endless Talmudic disputation, with true believers parsing the meaning of each note." Yiddish word definitions come with the occasional smirk, like the entry for "ungapatchka," meaning "garish, overdone, in poor taste" - illustrated with a photo of Trump Tower.
Entries cover a wide range of Jews: Ayn Rand, Joe Lieberman, Shylock, Harry Houdini, Sandy Koufax, Gertrude Stein, Vidal Sassoon, Leonard Nimoy, Monica Lewinsky and on and on. There are people you might not have thought were Jewish - actress Scarlett Johansson, for instance, or the rapper Drake. "We also list people who should be Jewish," Oppenheimer adds, as his audience laughs. "Like Alan Alda. Isn't Alda really kind of a Jew by now? Let's adopt him!"
In the Q & A, the three handle the topic of whether this or that attitude or activity is "Jewish" or not. When Oppenheimer opines that camping out is a "goyish" thing to do, Leibovitz disagrees. "For me, camping is 100 percent Jewish. But skiing? What Jew skis?!" For Oppenheimer, who grew up skiing, the antithetical Jewish sport is lacrosse. "There were Jews at my prep school who were excellent soccer players, tennis players, swimmers. But not one lacrosse player."
"The Newish Jewish Encyclopedia" bears the subtitle, "From Abraham to Zabar's and Everything in Between," and its authors promise that a future, expanded edition will get even closer to the absolute end of the alphabet. That volume, they say, will end with "ZZ Top." Definition? "Bunch of dudes who look like Hasidic Jews." The audience chortles.
Beneath all the merriment, the authors and their book exude a deep appreciation of both the faith and the life that go with being Jewish. "It's an extraordinary privilege and joy to encounter this tradition," says Mark Oppenheimer, "either from within or from without."
Rand Richards Cooper reviews restaurants and writes the monthly "In Our Midst" column for Hartford Magazine. His work has been published in The Courant for more than two decades and has appeared in The New Yorker, Harper's, GQ, Esquire, The Atlantic and many other magazines. A longtime contributing editor at Bon Appétit and a former restaurant critic for the New York Times, Rand is also the author of two works of fiction.

Texto completo: If they were smart, members of the Democratic Party would support Bernie Sanders as their nominee. But of course, they won't, if there's any way they can prevent his nomination.
Not surprisingly, Sanders' PAC-supported or big money opponents, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg, have belittled his candidacy. But the party's old guard - Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Barney Frank - have also publicly attacked and/or worked against Sanders.
New York Times opinion writers - Paul Krugman, Timothy Egan, Frank Bruni, Bret Stephens, and David Brooks - have virtually lined up to dismiss the Sanders campaign; "he can't win" or "he's like Trump only his opposite" are common refrains. Washington Post columnists follow suit. And MSNBC's Chris Matthews went off the rails, implying Sanders' rather tame version of democratic socialism put him on the same side as communist leaders such as Fidel Castro who would have, if they won the Cold War, Matthews asserted, conducted public executions in Central Park.
Similarly, the well-endowed Democratic PAC, the Democratic Majority for Israel, funded attack ads on Bernie in Iowa, while the corporate Partnership for America's Health Care Future has mobilized to "change the conversation around "Medicare for All" to protect the for-profit health care industry. And, of course, the powerful right-wing attack machine, from Charles Koch's organization to the Federalist magazine, have attacked Sanders.
There will be a great deal more of this in the coming months, as these interests try to bury Sanders' populist message. Let's look at one of their arguments: "Sanders can't beat Trump."
The latest Quinnipiac national poll (pre-New Hampshire) has Bernie 8 percentage points ahead of Trump, shortly after Trump's post-impeachment bump, and Bernie's campaign will vividly bring out the enormous contradictions in the Trump administration. But more fundamentally, are any of the centrist Democratic candidates likely to beat Trump with their "more of the same" arguments?
The New York Times columnist David Brooks revealed data showing that tens of thousands of voters in the key swing-to-Trump states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin voted for Sanders in the primary and Trump in the election - in sufficient numbers to cost the Democrats the election.
However, Brooks draws a dubious conclusion from the data, suggesting Sanders' voters will sit out the election if a different Democrat is nominated. Those who voted for Sanders in those primaries but Trump in the general election are not Sanders' fervid young supporters, but in all likelihood largely alienated white working-class or rural Americans, fed up with a Democratic Party that they feel long ago deserted them.
In short, the data don't suggest abandonment of Democratic nominees as much as they suggest the potential for Sanders, alone among Democratic candidates, to pull working-class and rural votes away from Trump.
A second way that Sanders expands the potential Democratic voter base is the fact that hundreds of thousands of diverse young people have been inspired by his sharp critique of corporate-dominated inequality, his advocacy of the Green New Deal and generally his vision of a more democratic future.
Among other things, these young people see in Sanders someone who recognizes the profound economic, social and ecological problems that will plague their future lives. They bring enormous energy and enthusiasm to a Bernie candidacy.
On the one hand, Sanders' candidacy inspires political activism among the young and those with long-held social justice grievances. On the other hand, he speaks authentically to disenchanted working-class whites and rural Americans. Sanders is not "too far left" for these voters; his essentially New Deal-type programs are too far left for Democrats like Bill Clinton who moved the party into the corporate center some 40 years ago.
The real hope represented by Sanders' campaign is that he can pull together these sharply separated populations - in the process shifting the focus to the elite forces whose propaganda has kept them apart.
This could represent the beginning of a real healing of America's tragic history around race and class. It could also represent what the political scientists like to call a "realignment" of American politics, one that promises far more democracy than the sad democratic facade we live under.
Ted Morgan is emeritus professor of political science at Lehigh University. His most recent book is "What Really Happened to the 1960s: How Mass Media Culture Failed American Democracy."

Texto completo: Zoe Kravitz is in the process of curating a pretty dope playlist.
After a few catchy early numbers and some recent jams like "Big Little Lies," the actor, singer, model and now producer is pumping up the volume on her career with new Hulu series "High Fidelity" and, of course, Matt Reeves' "The Batman," in which she co-stars as Catwoman.
Variety caught up with Kravitz, 31, to talk romantic comedies, playing opposite Robert Pattinson and those "Big Little Lies" behind-the-scenes issues.

Q: Your character in "High Fidelity" is someone who lives and breathes music. Is that something you relate to?
A: Her inability to fully see herself is something I've experienced, something I've gone through. Someone who's able to understand something like music so deeply and then struggle to understand how a relationship works is really interesting to me. I've had those moments in my life where I felt like I understand art and music really well, I can talk about that, I can do that - but love is more complicated.

Q: What romantic comedies, other than the original "High Fidelity," were you looking to for inspiration?
A: "Sex and the City" was a major influence for me. There was a certain element of comedy and true drama and authenticity, wit and fearlessness that always attracted me, and it's also just such a New York show; for someone who lives there, they did it correctly. I've always been drawn to the kinds of stories that revolve around people stuck in a place and the things they talk about, because it felt like what I do with my friends. You sit around, you smoke weed, you talk about movies, you argue about characters and actors and music. That's some of my favorite (stuff) to do. When it's written well, when it feels real, it's so fun to see.

Q: Talk to me about the regular fourth-wall breaks; what do they illuminate about your character?
A: When you do those, you have to break a habit, because your whole career you're told to not look at the camera, not acknowledge it, so I had to allow myself to have a new relationship with the camera, to think of it as my friend. It's good to imagine a person there, you're talking to your friend because it can feel stiff and performative otherwise, because that device lets the audience into the character, especially because Rob is so guarded, it's important that she's able to feel vulnerable in those moments. I would literally picture a friend of mine in front of the camera and say I'm talking to a person right now.

Q: Those coupled with the subject matter feel very reminiscent of "Fleabag."
A: I actually didn't watch "Fleabag" on purpose ... because when we were writing it and people learned I was talking to camera, the first thing they would say is "Fleabag!" I felt like if I saw the show I would either imitate, or be intimated by, or compare myself to Phoebe's performance. I did not watch the show until after, and then of course I loved it and thought it was ... perfect.

Q: Switching focus to "The Batman," DC films come with their own unique brand of pressure. Is that something you're nervous about?
A: Definitely, I was excited when I got the role, and usually when you get a job, the people who are excited about it are you, your parents, your agent, your friends and that's kind of it. But when the press release came, I got more text messages and calls than I've gotten on my birthday, on my wedding day. All of a sudden, the reality began to sink in about what this means not only to me but to everybody else culturally - and the fans of this universe are so dedicated and opinionated.

Q: You could certainly say that.
A: It was a little scary, but also whenever I get nervous about something, I feel it pushes me to a better place, so I welcome the nerves. If you start focusing too much on what people are going to think you're doing yourself a disservice. Of course, I want to honor the fans and hope they like what I do with the role, but in order to do what I think I need to do with Catwoman, I have to go internal and forget about the rest of the world.

Q: How do you feel about Robert Pattinson as Batman? What has it been like working with him so far?
A: I've never worked with him before, but we've been together for the last few weeks ... training together and rehearsing together, and he's just a delightful person and such a wonderful, thoughtful actor. I think he's perfect for the role, and it's going to be such an adventure. I'm excited to have him as my partner in crime and to be there to support each other, because it's intense. It's going to be a long shoot and there's a lot of pressure, and I know he has my back and I have his.

Q: Nicole Kidman said she would be open to doing another season of "Big Little Lies," but she pointed to your busy schedule to say that a potential Season 3 won't be here for some time.
A: Mine?! How about Meryl or Reese or Shailene? For wonderful reasons everyone's busy, but I think we would all make time to make another season happen. It really feels like priority No. 1 for a lot of us, because we love each other, and we love the story and we love culturally what it means to people. I feel like all of us would clear whatever we could to make that happen. But don't try and throw me under the bus, Nicole!

Q: Did you feel like Season 2 provided a satisfying ending to Bonnie's story?
A: I don't know if it felt like an ending, but it felt like there was a breakthrough, especially coming from Season 1 where she's seen as this picture-perfect, very Zen person. It was nice to break that all down this season. It's almost like we met Bonnie for the first time by the end of Season 2. It's always a delight to get the opportunity to go deeper into a character, because you don't always get a chance to do that.

Texto completo: "Coffee," said Buzzy O'Keeffe, owner of New York's renowned River Café in Brooklyn, "is the last thing a restaurant diner tastes - so it better be good."
For O'Keeffe, it seems, it's never good enough. Every couple of weeks he assembles his chef and several staff members for a blind tasting of brews from around the world. Those that pass muster - typically under 20% - might find their way into the restaurant's ever-changing house blend, which typically contains beans from Colombia, Brazil, Sumatra and Costa Rica.
"I have been searching for the perfect coffee since my 30s," said O'Keeffe, now in his discriminating 70s. "I have found that even the perfect blend will vary from time to time, depending on the year's crop - something like wine but not quite as fickle."
Last year, when I learned that he was planning a trip to coffee plantations in Costa Rica, I asked if I could tag along, a caffeinated cohort one might say.
On a balmy Sunday evening we arrived in San José, the country's sprawling capital.
O'Keeffe was interested in comparing freshly roasted Arabica coffee (Arabica beans are the highest quality; robusta beans are generally for the mass market) with what he purchases once the beans are exported to New York. (They should be very similar if delivered promptly and shielded from air and sunlight.) Our first destination was a coffee company outside of San José called Café Britt. It was founded in 1985 by Steve Aronson, an American now living in Costa Rica and a world authority on coffee whose career dates to the early 1970s as an apprentice taster in Manhattan.
"At that time all of the good Costa Rican coffee was exported, and the inferior stuff stayed here," Aronson explained. He wanted to change that. He launched the first gourmet coffee growing and roasting company in the country and began domestic distribution while at the same time building his export trade. Today Britt coffee is sold throughout much of Central and South America.
The company conducts hourlong tours of its half-acre educational plantation, followed by a discussion and a short film. Guests are taken through the steps of coffee bean processing from planting seedlings to harvesting what are called "coffee cherries," large red pods that hold two coffee beans each. Newly planted coffee bushes require three to four years to produce cherries. Once removed the beans are dried, husked in a special machine, graded and packed for transport. Some operations, like Britt, roast their beans in house before shipping. At the end of our tour came a "cupping," the professional term for coffee assessments. (The cupping is not part of the basic tour; there is a $20 supplement per person.)
"OK, when we begin will the coffee still be hot?" O'Keeffe inquired, sitting at a big round table holding about 20 half-filled ceramic cups. As with wine, the temperature at which coffee is served at professional tastings alters its characteristics - hot coffee releases more aromatics.
The coffee cups on the table contained brews from Arabica beans cultivated at different altitudes. Among them: Tarrazu, which thrives in the high mountains southwest of San José (typically characterized as medium-bodied and high in acid, with hints of chocolate); Tres Rios, east of the capital (also with ample acid and a full, smooth body); Central Valley (the high altitude region west of the capital and known for smooth and full-bodied brews); and Orosí, to the southeast, said to be almost floral, although that eluded us amateurs.
Aronson called out instructions.
"Stir the coffee, then place your nose so it's almost touching it. Sniff. Then lift the cup over your lip and slurp." Expectoration optional.
O'Keeffe tasted each brew methodically, returning to several for another slurp. He said that, for the most part, the differences were more subtle than he had expected.
"Being down here, I thought I'd be tasting peaches or something," he laughed.
The Britt tour, about an hour, concludes with a Costa Rican buffet lunch.
Heading to Starbucks central
The following morning we drove 5,000 feet above the lushly carpeted valley on the slopes of the irascible Poás Volcano, to the 2-year-old Starbucks global agronomy complex and visitors center called Hacienda Alsacia. I would go for the view alone. Situated on a 600-acre working plantation, it is where the company conducts farming research and development, creates programs to help small-scale coffee farmers around the world boost their income and educates the public about what Starbucks calls sustainable coffee.
The 1 1/2-hour tour is similar to that at Britt but more hands-on. It starts with demonstrations on how seedlings are planted and allowed to mature, and on how to dry beans by raking them over hot cement. At one point the tour guide asked for a volunteer to help dry the beans under a wilting sun. There were no takers. He drafted O'Keeffe, who stepped forward wearing the bemused expression of someone called onto the stage by a magician. Four round trips with the rake was enough. A cupping followed, and O'Keeffe noted that, not surprisingly, the darker the roast the more intensely acidic and flavorful the coffee. Think of Starbucks' sharp and heavily roasted - some say over-roasted - product.
Winding down the mountain we happened upon La Casona de Doña Julia, two large barnlike structures with a sign reading "Comida Auténticamente Costarricense" (Authentic Costa Rican Cuisine). We sat at a long picnic table and sipped chilled Imperial, a Costa Rican beer. Actually, by the time it arrived it was only half chilled. A word about dining in Costa Rica restaurants: Service is slow, really slow, take-a-walk-between-courses slow.
A luxurious brew
If you're looking for a little opulence with your Arabica, it can be found half an hour from the airport at Finca Rosa Blanca Coffee Plantation Resort. It's snuggled amid 30 undulating acres of coffee - everything is assiduously eco-friendly and sustainable - with 13 tropically themed rooms and two suites (doubles around $350 with tax).
The daily 2 1/2-hour coffee program, which is open to non-guests with reservations ($40 per person), is as much about rainforest ecology and preservation as what you sip at breakfast. Those of an avian bent can roam the heavily shaded 30-acre property to seek out some of the nearly 250 species of tropical birds.
"We're all about being green and sustainable," said the farm supervisor and head roaster, Carlos Sanchéz. "Even the hotel - we built it with recyclable materials."
Our final stop was in the town of Naranjo, another short hop from the city, at the Espíritu Santo Coffee Tour. The coffee itinerary - by now I could moonlight as a tour guide - in a 600-acre plantation is unveiled in seven stages, from planting to merchandising. It can be a long lesson, but the engaging guides sense when to pick up the pace. And not least, they are great with children.
Hurtling through so many cups of coffee in four days was educational, O'Keeffe noted, as coffee, like wine, is a moving target - and the tasting never stops.
This reminded O'Keeffe of a little story he sometimes pulls out of his wallet when in the presence of wine connoisseurs, about a television skit about wine tasting. "One actor said 'I taste raspberries!' and another said 'I taste pears, peaches, cherries!' and so forth," he said. When it came to the final actor, "He said, 'I taste crushed grapes.' It's like that with coffee tours."

Texto completo: In just three books, the writing team of Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen have earned a reputation for highly entertaining psychological thrillers about women's friendships, obsessions and manipulation. Hendricks, a former editor at Simon & Schuster, and Pekkanen, a former journalist and author under her own name, know how to steer their novels to maximum effect with myriad twists. Although their method doesn't leave room for much character development, the energetic plots are tight and so inviting that each of their efforts has landed on the New York Times Bestsellers List.
Shay Miller drifts through life, eking out a living as a temp worker and sharing an apartment with a male friend on whom she has a crush but who is dating another woman. A market researcher obsessed with statistics, Shay was downsized from her full-time job and lost her apartment when she discovered that her boyfriend was cheating on her. Shay has few prospects and feels she's "caught in a slow spiral."
Her life changes when she watches in horror as Amanda Evinger throws herself in front of a Manhattan subway train. Although they were strangers, Shay becomes obsessed with Amanda, wanting to know everything about the deceased woman and what led her to commit suicide.
Shay finds out where Amanda lived and shows up at her memorial service. Glamorous sisters Jane and Cassandra Moore are quite interested in Shay and what relationship she may have had with Amanda. The Moore sisters have a tight circle of women who administer their own brand of vigilante justice on those who may have wronged one member of the group. They can't believe that Shay and Amanda had never met.
Shay is thrilled with the Moore sisters and their friends, who become her new best friends, giving her a new attitude toward life and belief in herself again. The sisters, and their friends, feel differently and see Shay as another target.
While the authors' last effort "The Wife Between Us" was a stronger effort, "You Are Not Alone" thrives on its twists and realistic tension. The solid plot overrides the deficiencies in characterization.
Meet the authors
Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen will discuss "You Are Not Alone" at 7 p.m. Feb. 26 at Murder on the Beach Mystery Bookstore, 104 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach; 561-279-7790, murderonthebeach.com.
Hendricks and Pekkanen along with Joseph Finder ("House on Fire"), Tim Mason ("The Darwin Affair") and Lynne Olson ("Madame Fourcade's Secret War") will be the guests during the Gilda Mallin Boca West Chapter of Hadassah's Annual Book and Author Luncheon beginning at 10 a.m. Feb. 27 at the Boca West Country Club, 20583 Boca West Drive, Boca Raton.

Texto completo: We should talk about minute 24.
It's the moment on "The Daily," the New York Times podcast, when reporter Megan Twohey asks Harvey Weinstein's lead defense attorney, Donna Rotunno, if she's ever been sexually assaulted.
"I have not," Rotunno answers. "I have not. Because I would never put myself in that position."
Twohey, co-author of "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement," which chronicles the Weinstein story from start to publication, pauses.
"So you're saying - actually, I'm sorry," Twohey says after a beat. "So you're saying that you have never been sexually assaulted because you would never put yourself in the position of being sexually assaulted?"
"No," Rotunno answers. "I've always made choices, from college-age on, where I never drank too much, I never went home with someone that I didn't know, I just never put myself in any vulnerable circumstance. Ever."
Rotunno has a role to play, and she's not going to go off-script during an interview with the reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize for the reporting that took down her client. Rotunno's job is to cast doubt on Weinstein's accusers. Her answer attempts to do just that.
But it also propels an ugly myth about assault that we need to push back on when it rears its ugly head.
Rape is not caused by poor choices. Rape is caused by rapists.
You can try to minimize your risks of being raped, just as you can try to minimize your risks of becoming the victim of any number of violent crimes. But that's not always enough. And if it has, for you, been enough, you are also the beneficiary of some very good luck.
Good luck to have been born into a home in which no one preyed upon you. Far, far too many children aren't so lucky.
Good luck to have never crossed paths with a predatory coach or mentor or youth group leader or priest or classmate or instructor or medical practitioner or boss.
Good luck to have not been the victim of spousal rape.
Good luck to have never been abducted.
Good luck to have gone through life, so far, without someone using their power - power in the form of a weapon, power in the form of physical size, power in the form of authority - to rob you of your bodily agency.
I wish every woman and man, girl and boy had such luck. They don't.
Maybe Rotunno subscribes to the just-world fallacy - the belief that we live in a morally fair society, and people who encounter misfortune likely had some hand in causing that fate. That's certainly easier than accepting that terrible things sometimes just happen. Unprovoked. Unjustly.
Or maybe she answered in the way that felt, to her, as honest as possible while still being as strategic as possible.
Regardless, her answer was toxic.
Because it adds to the already far too prevalent messages that assault survivors are slapped in the face with repeatedly: that they could have prevented their assault, that they had some hand in causing their assault, that they should have known better than to become a victim of assault.
It contributes to a culture of doubt and denial and blame that victims have to navigate when deciding whether to come forward with their stories - stories that, if they are heard and heeded, can save more people from being victimized. How many athletes may have been spared Larry Nassar's reign of terror if coaches and parents and college administrators acted as soon as the gymnasts in his care started speaking up?
And it slows us down from learning what we really need to grasp and understand about sexual assault: that it is, above all, an abhorrent abuse of power. It is a stripping away of another person's autonomy. It is a debasing of that person's humanity. It says, "I matter. You don't."
No one puts themselves in that position. To surrender their autonomy and humanity. To not matter.
Rotunno is doing her job. Maybe it will work in court; maybe it won't.
But when her words float into the national dialogue as they did on that podcast, the rest of us get to make our own judgment. The rest of us get to reject that (il)logic.
The rest of us get to overrule that kind of toxic messaging and make sure it doesn't find a safe place to land and grow and spread.

Texto completo: BENGHAZI, Libya - The field marshal stares from billboards into the wreckage of the Libyan city of Benghazi. His uniform is festooned with epaulets and honors, even as the civil war he is waging has stalled into a bloody stalemate.
His plainclothes security agents loiter and listen in cafes and hotel lobbies. He has handed control of the mosques to extremist preachers. And he has showered patronage on a tribal death squad called the Avengers of Blood, blamed for a long string of disappearances and killings of his political opponents.
"We are living in a prison," said Ahmed Sharkasi, a liberal activist from Benghazi who fled to Tunis because of threats on his life.
Khalifa Hifter, the 76-year-old commander known in his dominion as "the marshal," is the military ruler of eastern Libya. He has been fighting for nearly six years to take control of the country, and he has been waging an assault on the capital, Tripoli, for the past 10 months.
The United Arab Emirates, Egypt and others have lined up behind him, and Russia has sent mercenaries. The largely powerless United Nations-sponsored government in Tripoli is defended mainly by regional militias and, recently, Turkey, which has flown in hundreds of paid Syrian fighters.
Hifter has cut off Libya's oil production for the past month to try to deprive the Tripoli government of revenue. Last week he began shelling its civilian port, killing three people, narrowly missing a ship loaded with liquefied natural gas and derailing United Nations-sponsored cease-fire talks.
Hifter has promised to build a stable, democratic and secular Libya, but he has largely shut Western journalists out of his territory. A rare visit there by a New York Times correspondent and photographer revealed an unwieldy authoritarianism that in many ways is both more puritanical and more lawless than Libya was under its last dictator, Moammar Gadhafi.
Hifter's Benghazi stronghold is a half-ruined city beset by corruption, where security agents trailed foreign journalists, residents cowered in fear of arbitrary arrest, and pro-government militias answered to no one.
Aging and distracted, Hifter is seldom seen in Benghazi. He presides from his mountain home an hour's drive to the west. He holds salons with tribal elders and depends on family as his closest advisers. Two of his sons are among his top military commanders, as well as his caretakers.
"They make sure he is well fed," said Faraj Najem, a director of a government-run research center who is close to Hifter. "They make sure he takes his medicine. They provide him with security when they are around him."
The center of Benghazi is little different today than it was in 2017, when Hifter seized it after a four-year campaign of shelling and bombing.
Neighborhoods on the periphery now bustle with newly opened stores and cafes. But the streets of the city center are crumbling.
Libya is rich with oil, but it is a volatile prize. It has been in turmoil since an Arab Spring revolt and NATO's intervention toppled Gadhafi nine years ago. Its deserts shelter Islamist militants, and its Mediterranean coastline teems with migrants.
Hifter had served as an officer in Gadhafi's army but later fled to the United States where he lived for decades as a CIA client before returning to Libya during the uprising in 2011.
He began his drive for power by promising to save Benghazi. In 2014, when Islamist militias were terrorizing the city, he vowed to declare military rule and rid the country of Islamists.
Armed by foreign sponsors, he started by recruiting fighters from local tribes and welcoming the help of former Gadhafi officers and officials.
Then he won the support of Saudi-style Islamist fighters - known as Salafists - who saw a common enemy in the rival schools of Islamists that Hifter was battling. He has never acknowledged any contradiction between his avowed hostility to political Islam and his brigades of Salafists.
The deals he struck with tribal militias, Salafists and former Gadhafi henchmen in Benghazi now threaten to run over his promises of secular law and order.
Many Benghazi residents celebrate Hifter for restoring security to the streets, an attitude reinforced in his official media. Images of Hifter's face are ubiquitous. A pro-Hifter satellite television network broadcasts his propaganda and sometimes Salafist sermons. Weekly street demonstrations, organized by the government's Office of Supporting Decisions, recall Gadhafi-era displays of forced enthusiasm.
Access to Benghazi by foreign journalists or rights groups is severely restricted. Residents must obtain official permission to travel abroad, sometimes requiring interrogation by security agents. Some are forced to submit reports about who they met outside Libya - or, sometimes, on friends and neighbors at home.
Opposition views are not welcome.
In July, a British-educated politician, Seham Sergiwa, 57, publicly questioned Hifter's assault on Tripoli. A group of armed men abducted her that night. They spray-painted a warning against criticizing the army on the wall of her house.
Her relatives outside Libya said the power was cut before the attack and police had ignored calls for help. Most family members now believe she is dead. But Benghazi authorities have told her husband that they believe she is alive and advised him to keep quiet.
"All the evidence points to Hifter," said her brother, Adam Sergiwa, a doctor living in Indiana. "We know that. Everybody knows that. He wanted to teach a lesson."
A spokesman for Hifter called the apparent killing an act of terrorism and said that his military had nothing to do with it.
Although no longer a battleground, Benghazi is hardly free of violence.
U.N. reports warn of frequent kidnappings, forced disappearances and assassinations by unknown assailants.
Responsibility for the violence is impossible to determine, but many Benghazi residents point to tribal militias that fought with Hifter.
One of the biggest sources of fighters was the Awaqir tribe. Members of the tribe now boast of their impunity, and some have claimed prime jobs in government-owned companies or even the local university.
Awaqirs formed the Avengers of Blood in 2013 to seek revenge after a deadly clash with an Islamist-leaning militia. The Avengers became known as enforcers for Hifter, widely blamed for disappearances and killings.
A spokesman for Hifter said the Avengers were unarmed civilians who collected info about "terrorists."
But during the abduction of Sergiwa, her attackers scrawled the name of the Avengers of Blood on the wall.

Texto completo: Fall and spring mornings are special for those who enjoy the sun's crystals cascading onto the Chesapeake Bay. A stroll on the sand or walking the boardwalk and enjoying the gift of a natural wonder can leave one with a smile and a twinkling eye. However, as our years slip by and we shake hands with new challenges, we may find strolls along waterfronts a bit more difficult. Our good balance becomes questionable. The knee we broke 20-odd years ago rebels. The good knee asks for more TLC. Our ready smiles and twinkles turn to frowns.
We and our bodies are maturing, and are trying to adjust to alternative means of achieving the same goals. They don't want to shut down; they would just like a little patience.
Jane Brody, in one of her columns in the health section of The New York Times, writes about her experiences with certain parts of her physical self being compromised by chronic, debilitating arthritis that took hold of her once ageless body. Brody had been a fitness guru, swimming laps for two hours a day, two miles of walking each day, and other physical activities her gym provided. To those of us who have had to say goodbye to what was normal, she advises we embrace our new abilities and our new normal. We should not wish for what our physical capabilities were. Creativity has many meanings.
Allow me to share.
Dating back to my teenage years, walking was a physical and emotional therapy exercise for me. Later, when I lived and worked in Manhattan, I would walk to and from work five days a week. One and half miles each way was normal as long as the rain and snow didn't interrupt. Moving to San Diego gave me the opportunity to frequently walk the beach. I also joined a group that taught the joys of tennis. Weekends or during Daylight Saving Time I'd go to a school playground and practice at the backboards. In tennis you don't take the eye off the ball, even in doubles. I preferred singles; it was more competitive and physical. When I moved back to Manhattan, I resumed the 1½-mile walk to and from work. When Mike and I married and moved here, we began our walks in the neighborhood at 6 a.m. before we left for our jobs.
But in the early 2000s, he developed a neurological disease, which gave him challenges that prevented some physical capabilities. Also in the early 2000s, my balance and hammer toes gave me problems with balance and prevented me from extensive walking. Retirement in 2005 opened the door to chair exercises. A few years later I went to an arthritis water exercise class. Finally, after several years of struggling with balance and feet, I regained a confidence and comfort level with what I could do. Also because of Mike's ongoing physical liabilities, I could not put myself into a compromising position. While I enjoy watching people playing tennis, riding bikes or walking in the sand, I must remember I did all that. I am thankful for the opportunities that permitted me to pursue those activities.
Depending on my weekday commitments, I now try to go to the pool at Fort Monroe's recreation center and breathe deeply while doing arthritis exercises. Saturday afternoons, I go to the pool, exercise and treat myself to happy, resilient teenage boys playing wheelchair basketball. Some of the boys are without legs. Yet there they are, twirling wheelchairs and putting the balls into the nets, all the while laughing and clapping when someone scores. This is their normal.
These events are added elements that give me pause. Their perseverance and confidence despite hardships bring smiles and the forever thank you for their mental and emotional strength. It's a reminder to me to say thanks for all I can do. Yes. There is a lump in my throat when I walk through the door to my car and wind around the waterfront toward home.

Texto completo: A ghost comes to vibrant life in Christina Lane's "Phantom Lady: Hollywood Producer Joan Harrison, the Forgotten Woman Behind Hitchcock."
Harrison is the ghost, or the titular phantom. Aside from film buffs and scholars, few know of her work. Yet Lane, chairwoman of the cinema department at the University of Miami, claims Harrison is "one of the last great untold stories of the classical Hollywood era." Lane's keenly observed and illuminating biography backs that assertion.
Nothing was spectral about Harrison's life and career. Growing up in Guildford, Surrey, after World War I, she was an energetic, assertive and talented young Englishwoman. At 15, she published film reviews. After schooling at the Sorbonne, then Oxford University, she wrote short stories. She also read voraciously - mysteries, horror stories and true crime tales.
In late 1933, Harrison, then 26, answered an ad for an assistant, posted by rising film director Alfred Hitchcock. After a brief interview, he hired Harrison to join him at Gaumont-British Picture Corp.
While she may occasionally have poured Hitchcock tea and jotted notes, Harrison from the start played an active role in shaping his films. A master of control as well as suspense, Hitchcock nevertheless drew upon Harrison's keen sense of film narratives. "Her sensibilities," Lane writes, "would help lay the foundation for Hitchcock's overall cinematic approach."
Working with the director's wife, Alma Reville, Harrison bolstered the female roles in "Young and Innocent" (1937) and "The Lady Vanishes" (1938), turning the films into tales of "spirited heroines who seek adventure, truth, and justice and are willing to act on their convictions."
Hitchcock insisted Harrison stay beside him when he came to the United States. Here she challenged producer David O. Selznick to transform the heroine of "Rebecca" (1940) played by Joan Fontaine from a mousy naif to an often assertive heroine. Harrison earned not only a screenwriting Oscar nomination that year for "Rebecca," but also a second nod for Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent" (1940).
However happy Harrison was as part of the Hitchcock entourage, she struck out on her own in 1943, to produce and write screenplays. She signed on at Universal Pictures, thus becoming the first woman producer at a major studio.
Note of Harrison's achievement suggested that stereotypes die hard. Harrison, The New York Times wrote, was "'the only producer anywhere, with dimples and a 24-inch waistline.'"
Harrison worked almost exclusively with film noir as the form peaked in the 1940s and early '50s. But on noir's shadowy, rain-slicked streets, she effected a major thematic change: her scripts replaced noir's treacherous femmes fatales with appealing, productive women. Thus, a female gumshoe becomes vital to helping clear a man unjustly accused of murder in "Phantom Lady" (1944).
Lane follows Harrison's solo career, detailing the novels and stories she was drawn to and the first-rate teams she gathered to realize her visions. Lane's analyses of performances and images in Harrison's films - "The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry" (1945), "Nocturne" (1946)," and 1947's double shot of "Ride the Pink Horse" and "They Won't Believe Me" - sharply delineate the films' styles and themes.
With television eclipsing film in the 1950s, Harrison went full circle, signing on as producer of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" and, in effect, importing her noir style to the small screen.
Along the way, she led a personal life as alluring and mysterious as her career. She loved creating diverse images with fashion, hairstyles and makeup while pursuing equally romantic affairs. There were liaisons with actors Clark Gable and Kirk Douglas and writer Irwin Shaw. Eventually she married spy novelist Eric Ambler. An unidentified woman, though, was said to be the love of her life.
Lane's rich portrait of Harrison virtually contradicts this book's title. Harrison was not "the woman behind Hitchcock"; she was beside him and sometimes ahead of him. On her own, she made her own distinctive contributions to American film. Now, we have that story.

Texto completo: Of all the campaign issues, the most important to Americans is probably the battle for a health care system that won't ruin you financially. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found nearly 80% of us favor legislation that protects against unexpected charges for services not covered by insurance. Twenty-eight states, including New York, already have such laws.
Our national system is a scrum of hospitals, doctors, insurance companies and drug firms over $3.6 trillion of annual spending. Read physician Elisabeth Rosenthal's New York Times piece "Who's Profiting From Your Outrageous Medical Bills?" on why no provider wants to surrender its "surprise bill" slice of the pie.
Restricting the revenue of the nation's largest employer is an enormous challenge with an economic price that will likely affect the industry's workers. Such consequences and remedies cannot be adequately addressed in the soundbites of debates and stump speeches.
Another big problem with "Medicare for All" is you often need supplemental insurance for adequate coverage, and some doctors don't accept Medicare. They can bill you up to 9.25% above what it pays them. That limit may rise.
Yet another problem: The president must deal with the powerful system that soured the Affordable Care Act. The medical and insurance industries hate Obamacare because it crimps profits. The public complains because it is still prey to capricious, high prices.
Like it or not, you'll always pay for insurance and care via premiums, co-pays, deductibles and surprise bills or via taxes or a mix of the above. Surprises that can cost you tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars are the X-factor in whether your taxes would be lower than what you'd otherwise pay.
I don't see how the Republican alternative to Obamacare, to be announced after the election, can actively control costs without betraying the party's pillar principle of unfettered free enterprise. The medical industry has so far stymied federal surprise billing legislation and defied President Trump's executive order for price transparency.
Why would private companies gladly forgo so much dough? Health care is a for-profit business, not a philanthropic enterprise.
As the CEO of Nostrum Laboratories told The Financial Times while defending his firm's 400% hike in the price of an antibiotic, "I think it is a moral requirement to make money when you can ... to sell the product for the highest price" and reward shareholders.
Crushing costs are a bitter pill for a population as sick (30.3 million have diabetes), addicted, and in debt as America's. All you can do is save as much money as possible and try to fight your surprise bills. Hospitals charge marked-up prices (the Charge Master Rate) for services. Insurance companies negotiate them down and you are under no automatic obligation to pay them. For information on how to contest them, visitwww.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/health_insurance/surprise_medical_bills.
Free market magic is often touted as the cure, but selling health plans across state lines won't do much unless companies pay doctors and hospitals enough to entice them to join their networks. Even then, you'll get nasty surprises unless that billing loophole is closed.
Cheaper à la carte plans leave you vulnerable to unforeseen ailments. President Trump publicly vows to protect pre-existing conditions, but no company is eager to insure sick people, especially the chronically ill. Coverage may be available after you become ill, but likely at a much higher price.
Unless a spirit of generosity and concern for the greater good sweeps the industry, your care will mainly be determined by your wealth or lack thereof. Given the inherent conflict between private free enterprise and the desire for government to harness it to better serve the wider public, a truly affordable system that covers everyone and everything is an extremely elusive goal.

Presidential pardon has lost its way

Texto completo: "I forgive you." Those are powerful words. They can lift a person's guilt or shame, and send a signal to others that all is well between you.
But "I forgive you" and "the country forgives you" are not the same thing. They shouldn't be. So perhaps it's time to rethink this whole presidential pardon business.
Now, before you scatter to your political corners, know that I say this not because President Donald Trump has used his pardon power largely as a means of rewarding supporters or getting back at enemies, but because other presidents have as well, and more are likely to do so in the future.
Unless you see something I don't, this country isn't coming together to hold hands anytime soon, no matter who wins the election in November. But one thing we should all agree upon is this:
A president is not a king.
Which is where these pardons began. In the British monarchy, the King (or Queen) has long had "the royal prerogative of mercy." It goes back to Anglo-Saxon times, when we used to number centuries in single digits.
Many things from those years make no sense today. The pardon has become one of them. We are not England. We don't have a royal family. We don't sing, "God save the President."
But for some reason, our forefathers, more than 200 years ago, carried over this tradition in creating the presidency, even though George Mason, considered the father of our Bill of Rights, objected vehemently. He wrote that the president, "ought not to have the power of pardoning, because he may frequently pardon crimes which were advised by himself."
Sound prescient?
A rash of pardons Think about it. Who is the president to singularly decide that someone's sentence — adjudicated by the federal courts — should suddenly be wiped away? Do we normally endow that kind of power to one official — to erase the work of prosecutors, judges and juries? I understand that governors can commute death sentences, but that's just sparing an execution in exchange for life in prison. It's not wiping a slate clean.
Presidents get to do that with pardons. And ours have done it for all kinds of reasons. Some appear compassionate, like freeing people serving crazy sentences for minor crimes. Some try to correct history, forgiving individuals posthumously for things that today would not be illegal.
But more and more over recent decades, presidents have been using pardons for political or personal reasons. Gerald Ford pardoned his former boss, Richard Nixon, after Nixon's resignation, even shielding him from being charged in the future. Ronald Reagan pardoned New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. George H.W. Bush pardoned Iran-Contra figures, including former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger.
Bill Clinton issued a rash of pardons on his last day in office, including Marc Rich, whose ex-wife had been a major Clinton contributor. Barack Obama used his pardon power nearly 2,000 times, more than the previous five presidents combined.
And Trump, still in his first term, has already pardoned people like controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio and commentator Dinesh D'Souza, both vocal supporters of his. Oh, and former San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr., who had never actually gone to jail in the first place.
Who believes this is proper? Now let's compare these pardons to the original intent. When our forefathers created this power, they envisioned it as a tool to heal rifts in the country. And at first, it was used that way. George Washington pardoned members of the Whisky Rebellion, one of our new nation's first government protests. He said he did so in hopes of unifying America.
Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson did similar things with pardons for Confederate supporters after the Civil War. Ford and Jimmy Carter offered amnesty to Vietnam draft violators.
Such moves, with national implications, are a far cry from helping your friends, supporters or contributors. And of course, the ultimate perversion of this power has already been threatened by Trump, when he tweeted that had "the absolute right to PARDON myself."
Who in their right mind thinks that's proper? Come on. I don't care how deep into Trump's camp someone might be. Telling yourself "you are officially forgiven" only works for dictators and warlords.
We are not governed by either. So why proffer that power? Trump has already broken down the normal protocol of presidential pardons — which used to take years and lots of paperwork and the Office of the Pardon Attorney — and has turned it into a whimsical, whenever-I-feel-like-it reality show. The pardon of former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik began with a phone call Tuesday morning and was completed by Tuesday afternoon, according to the New York Times.
A former junk bond king? A football team owner? A governor who tried to sell a Senate seat? These are not pardons that "heal the nation." If anything, they anger half of it, which delights the other half, which does nothing for the good of the nation and everything for making a president feel like a king.
Which, when we think about it, was everything our forefathers were trying to escape from, wasn't it?

Savoring Costa Rica Tasting journey to haciendas and plantations follows coffee beans from tree to cup, sip by sip

Texto completo: "Coffee," said Buzzy O'Keeffe, owner of New York's renowned River Café in Brooklyn, "is the last thing a restaurant diner tastes - so it better be good."
For O'Keeffe, it seems, it's never good enough. Every couple of weeks he assembles his chef and several staff members for a blind tasting of brews from around the world. Those that pass muster - typically under 20% - might find their way into the restaurant's ever-changing house blend, which typically contains beans from Colombia, Brazil, Sumatra and Costa Rica.
"I have been searching for the perfect coffee since my 30s," said O'Keeffe, now in his discriminating 70s. "I have found that even the perfect blend will vary from time to time, depending on the year's crop - something like wine but not quite as fickle."
Last year, when I learned that he was planning a trip to coffee plantations in Costa Rica, I asked if I could tag along, a caffeinated cohort one might say.
On a balmy Sunday evening we arrived in San José, the country's sprawling capital.
O'Keeffe was interested in comparing freshly roasted Arabica coffee (Arabica beans are the highest quality; robusta beans are generally for the mass market) with what he purchases once the beans are exported to New York. (They should be very similar if delivered promptly and shielded from air and sunlight.) Our first destination was a coffee company outside of San José called Café Britt. It was founded in 1985 by Steve Aronson, an American now living in Costa Rica and a world authority on coffee whose career dates to the early 1970s as an apprentice taster in Manhattan.
"At that time all of the good Costa Rican coffee was exported, and the inferior stuff stayed here," Aronson explained. He wanted to change that. He launched the first gourmet coffee growing and roasting company in the country and began domestic distribution while at the same time building his export trade. Today Britt coffee is sold throughout much of Central and South America.
The company conducts hourlong tours of its half-acre educational plantation, followed by a discussion and a short film. Guests are taken through the steps of coffee bean processing from planting seedlings to harvesting what are called "coffee cherries," large red pods that hold two coffee beans each. Newly planted coffee bushes require three to four years to produce cherries. Once removed the beans are dried, husked in a special machine, graded and packed for transport. Some operations, like Britt, roast their beans in house before shipping. At the end of our tour came a "cupping," the professional term for coffee assessments. (The cupping is not part of the basic tour; there is a $20 supplement per person.)
"OK, when we begin will the coffee still be hot?" O'Keeffe inquired, sitting at a big round table holding about 20 half-filled ceramic cups. As with wine, the temperature at which coffee is served at professional tastings alters its characteristics - hot coffee releases more aromatics.
The coffee cups on the table contained brews from Arabica beans cultivated at different altitudes. Among them: Tarrazu, which thrives in the high mountains southwest of San José (typically characterized as medium-bodied and high in acid, with hints of chocolate); Tres Rios, east of the capital (also with ample acid and a full, smooth body); Central Valley (the high altitude region west of the capital and known for smooth and full-bodied brews); and Orosí, to the southeast, said to be almost floral, although that eluded us amateurs.
Aronson called out instructions.
"Stir the coffee, then place your nose so it's almost touching it. Sniff. Then lift the cup over your lip and slurp." Expectoration optional.
O'Keeffe tasted each brew methodically, returning to several for another slurp. He said that, for the most part, the differences were more subtle than he had expected.
"Being down here, I thought I'd be tasting peaches or something," he laughed.
The Britt tour, about an hour, concludes with a Costa Rican buffet lunch.
Heading to Starbucks central
The following morning we drove 5,000 feet above the lushly carpeted valley on the slopes of the irascible Poás Volcano, to the 2-year-old Starbucks global agronomy complex and visitors center called Hacienda Alsacia. I would go for the view alone. Situated on a 600-acre working plantation, it is where the company conducts farming research and development, creates programs to help small-scale coffee farmers around the world boost their income and educates the public about what Starbucks calls sustainable coffee.
The 1 1/2-hour tour is similar to that at Britt but more hands-on. It starts with demonstrations on how seedlings are planted and allowed to mature, and on how to dry beans by raking them over hot cement. At one point the tour guide asked for a volunteer to help dry the beans under a wilting sun. There were no takers. He drafted O'Keeffe, who stepped forward wearing the bemused expression of someone called onto the stage by a magician. Four round trips with the rake was enough. A cupping followed, and O'Keeffe noted that, not surprisingly, the darker the roast the more intensely acidic and flavorful the coffee. Think of Starbucks' sharp and heavily roasted - some say over-roasted - product.
Winding down the mountain we happened upon La Casona de Doña Julia, two large barnlike structures with a sign reading "Comida Auténticamente Costarricense" (Authentic Costa Rican Cuisine). We sat at a long picnic table and sipped chilled Imperial, a Costa Rican beer. Actually, by the time it arrived it was only half chilled. A word about dining in Costa Rica restaurants: Service is slow, really slow, take-a-walk-between-courses slow.
A luxurious brew
If you're looking for a little opulence with your Arabica, it can be found half an hour from the airport at Finca Rosa Blanca Coffee Plantation Resort. It's snuggled amid 30 undulating acres of coffee - everything is assiduously eco-friendly and sustainable - with 13 tropically themed rooms and two suites (doubles around $350 with tax).
The daily 2 1/2-hour coffee program, which is open to non-guests with reservations ($40 per person), is as much about rainforest ecology and preservation as what you sip at breakfast. Those of an avian bent can roam the heavily shaded 30-acre property to seek out some of the nearly 250 species of tropical birds.
"We're all about being green and sustainable," said the farm supervisor and head roaster, Carlos Sanchéz. "Even the hotel - we built it with recyclable materials."
Our final stop was in the town of Naranjo, another short hop from the city, at the Espíritu Santo Coffee Tour. The coffee itinerary - by now I could moonlight as a tour guide - in a 600-acre plantation is unveiled in seven stages, from planting to merchandising. It can be a long lesson, but the engaging guides sense when to pick up the pace. And not least, they are great with children.
Hurtling through so many cups of coffee in four days was educational, O'Keeffe noted, as coffee, like wine, is a moving target - and the tasting never stops.
This reminded O'Keeffe of a little story he sometimes pulls out of his wallet when in the presence of wine connoisseurs, about a television skit about wine tasting. "One actor said 'I taste raspberries!' and another said 'I taste pears, peaches, cherries!' and so forth," he said. When it came to the final actor, "He said, 'I taste crushed grapes.' It's like that with coffee tours."

Living in post-integrity America now painfully clear

Texto completo: Back during the scandal over his sexual exploitation of a young intern, Bill Clinton was pilloried in this space for his moral defects.
To which many liberals responded with derision. Morality? What did that matter? The economy was good, we were at peace and Clinton was hardly the first man to fool around and lie about it. As one reader put it, he was hired to be a president, not a pope.
At the time, that felt like a rationalization. A generation later, it feels like a portent. Indeed, it is often said that we are living now in Post-Fact America but truth is, we are also living in Post-Integrity America.
No, that's not breaking news. But it's been brought into painfully clear focus these last few days.
One watched - not with surprise anymore, the capacity for that being long lost, but surely with dread and fascination - as Donald Trump launched his post-impeachment purge of aides deemed insufficiently sycophantic. But that was just a prelude.
Last week, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 people, most of them guilty of lying, fraud, corruption, tax evasion and similar crimes. In other words, the kinds of things of which Trump has often been accused.
The power to soften or wipe away criminal convictions is one of the nicer perks of the presidency, allowing compassion to be shown to those who deserve it. And in fairness, several of those who benefited last week seem to meet that standard. Crystal Munoz, for instance, had been sentenced to almost 20 years for dealing pot.
But it is worth noting that every person Trump pardoned or gave clemency came to his attention not through the normal machinery of government, but through inside connections or else, as The New York Times noted, "were promoted on Fox News." Some were championed by aides and allies. Some had donated big money to his campaign. And again, most had breached the public trust.
Like former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who had served eight years of a 14-year sentence for trying to sell Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat. Trump, who has opined how unfair it is that U.S. companies are not allowed to pay bribes to do business overseas, had called that sentence "ridiculous."
It's no great leap to suggest that he sees himself in Blagojevich. Or in former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and financier Michael Milken, whom he pardoned for tax fraud and securities fraud, respectively.
If granting clemency and pardons opens a window upon a president's moral priorities - and it does - the view offered here suggests an unfortunate affinity for scammers and grifters, an empathy for those on the make, cutting deals, cutting corners, living the dream, until they got caught up by pesky rules designed to enforce integrity. And if those same people happened to give him money or had their names whispered into his ear by a friend, so much the better.
That's not how this is supposed to work. And that it is working this way right out in the open, before our very eyes, suggests -- no, screams -- Trump's imperviousness to any sense of ethical affront.
During Clinton's scandal, it was argued in this space that a president stamps himself upon an era "not simply by legislative accomplishment, but also ... by dint of personal authority and moral suasion."
Trump disproves that. He has stamped himself upon this era while ignoring the very idea of personal authority or moral suasion -- and daring us to care. But we had better. By his lack of personal character, Trump threatens our national character. And he stamps this era with the signature lesson of his life:
Once you give up integrity, it's easy to give up everything else.

Texto completo: I'm not proud of this, but lately I've been chucking a fair amount of plastic in the trash.
And I've always considered myself a pretty die-hard recycler.
So, what happened to make me a planet killer, you ask? I've seen a spate of recent videos and articles laying out some pretty troubling stats about recycling's efficacy, particularly when it comes to plastics.
Judging from all the reader questions I get about whether our recycling is actually recycled, you've probably seen them, too. On Dec. 9, 2019, the New York Times dropped a cheery little 5-minute video titled, "The Great Recycling Con."
The gist is that one of the greatest tricks big corporations that use and sell tons of plastic items ever played on the American people is making us think we could recycle all of their stuff.
"But here's the big secret: Entire categories of papers and plastics are rarely recycled," the female narrator says. "Of seven types of plastic that people put into blue bins, five whole categories hardly ever get recycled at all. According to the EPA, in 2017, as little as 8.4% of our discarded plastic went through that magic recycling process."
You can find the video here: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/opinion/recycling-myths.html
A global problem Back in 2018, China said it was going to stop taking in the world's recycling, and the U.S. used to send about 20 million tons a year of ours to China. So it started going to other countries, including Malaysia and the Philippines, but they also said "no thanks."
So what we've got here is a world awash in plastics that aren't being recycled, according to the Times and CNN and other outlets.
And for the most part, they're correct — at least globally.
Yes, you should still recycle But I'm not saying to stop recycling altogether. In fact, I'm going to encourage you to keep recycling — and yes, that includes plastics.
Why, you ask? Because recycling is often a local phenomenon, and just about all of our local recycling goes to the Curbside Management facility in Woodfin.
"The easy answer is, we are recycling everything on our accepted list," said Nancy Lawson, co-owner of the business, which goes by Curbie. "We have homes for these things. Is it more difficult to find homes without China accepting them? Absolutely. Are the markets lower? Are the prices lower? Absolutely."
But the bottom line is if you are "putting the correct things in the recycling bin, those things are being recycled in this area," Lawson said.
What can I recycle? We've run this before, but it's worth running again, so here's the list of what you can recycle at Curbie:
Metal cans — Including aluminum, steel and tin.
Plastics — Only food, beverage, personal care or household plastic containers (jugs, tubs, bottles and jars).
Glass Bottles and Jars — clear, brown, green.
Paper — Milk and juice cartons (including juice boxes); newspapers and inserts, catalogs, junk mail, magazines, cereal boxes, paper egg cartons, envelopes, Manila envelopes, office paper, paper, phone books, glossy paper, Post-It-Notes, brown paper bags, paper towel rolls.
Corrugated cardboard — lay it flat under the bins. But skip the grease-stained pizza boxes — they can't be recycled.
You can find all this information and more at Curbie.com
Curbie cannot recycle plastic bags, so don't send them in. Also, Curbie has these items on its "Keep These Out!" list: aerosol cans, aluminum foil, all batteries, ceramic items, clothing or textiles, diapers, disposable cups (plastic and coffee), electronics, food-tainted items, household glass, medical waste, hazardous waste, scrap metal and wood, shredded paper, Styrofoam/peanuts, "tanglers" (cords, hoses, wires, etc.), tires, toys.
Locally, plastics do get recycled I asked Lawson specifically about plastics, and those news stories about just 8.4% of them being recycled worldwide. Again, she said to look at this from a local angle.
"Recycling is very specific to the area in which you live," Lawson said. "We send all of our recyclables within a five-hour radius of us."
With plastics, Curbie sends them to a carpet manufacturer. So the yogurt containers I toss in my bin end up under foot as new carpet.
In that regard, we're fortunate.
"But if you live in another area, they may not have a carpet manufacturer in their five-hour radius," Lawson said.
The global situation has tightened what all can be shipped out for those carpets, Lawson said, and that means manufacturers are "being a lot more picky about contaminants in the loads," Lawson said. "So some of the things we may have been able to put in prior, they're not accepting anymore."
She gave the example of those clam shell type berry containers. Simply put, "Those are not being accepted anymore. They're not on the accepted list."
But all those items listed above are, so keep sending them in.
That goes for glass and paper and cans, too. Curbie has domestic companies in that five-hour radius that take those materials.
A tough market, though It is not all daisies and unicorns, though.
"I'm not trying to paint a rosy picture of the recycling industry, because right now it's at all-time lows, as far as price we receive to market the materials," Lawson said. "We're still able to find homes for (materials) — not at the price we want, but we are able to get rid of it."
In short, they are not sending recyclable materials to the landfill.
With China and other countries declining materials, "there's a great influx of material here in the states, which drives the price very low," Lawson said. With some materials, including paper and glass, Curbie actually has to pay companies to take it.
But they make enough on other products to remain profitable.
Some localities in America have stopped taking certain materials because of the global situation.
We definitely have a problem here and in other countries on just the sheer amount of plastics being produced, especially with plastics. That New York Times video does a great job of explaining how companies have been very misleading about their products and recyclability.
Also — and this will shock no one — the federal government has created byzantine rules that allow companies to claim recyclability in cases when it's not really an option.
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle What we really need to do is stop buying so much plastic packaging to start with, and start using reusable coffee mugs instead of plastic cups, buying in bulk where we can, using reusable shopping bags and generally being smarter shoppers.
Honestly, chucking so much stuff in the trash just makes me feel bad. It seems so wasteful, and in many cases, it is, especially with aluminum cans and other products that are being recycled.
I also reached out to Asheville GreenWorks, which does a great job coordinating "hard-to-recycle" events for materials (Find out more here: https://www.ashevillegreenworks.org/hard-2-recycle.html)
Joéle Emma, director of education at the nonprofit, brought up some good points that we sometimes forget about.
"Recycling results in less items going to the landfill and may cause a reduction of raw material being extracted from our natural resources," Emma said. "Keeping more of our recyclables in this country and sorting efficiently, we can keep the carbon footprint caused by recycling down."
That cuts down on transportation of new materials, which requires the use of gas, oil, rubber and other natural resources.
Emma offered some other recycling food for thought.
"There are two things to think about — keeping the (recycling) stream clean and therefore efficient, and creating a market for recyclable materials by buying items made from recyclable materials and also buying items that are recyclable," Emma said.
The bottom line is try to buy less plastic. I've largely stopped buying bottled water, and my coworkers have shamed me into not using so many plastic cups for coffee or water.
Honestly, it's just really lazy of me. I'm also looking for some better options for frozen dinners I bring for lunch, as some of them have an astounding amount of plastic.
The bottom line is the worldwide recycling market is a mess, and the world — meaning us — needs to look at a better solution than the avalanche of plastics we pump out every day. Really, 100 years from now, when people are dealing with our still-decomposing plastic deluge, they're going to be wondering what the hell we were thinking.
Maybe something like, "Seriously, they couldn't package a salad in something that would decompose?"
But meanwhile, here and now, we're fortunate to have Curbie actually recycling our stuff. So maybe renew your commitment to recycling, and make sure you put in the right stuff and clean it properly.
And if you can, stop buying so much plastic.

Recycled paper falls down a shoot from a conveyor belt after being sorted by employees at the Curbside Management recycling center in Woodfin on Aug. 20, 2014. Employees have to weed out non-recyclable items, such as plastic bags, and sort through others not meant for the paper section. Curbside Management, or Curbie, handles recycling for the city of Asheville and its 30,000 customers, as well as for Fletcher, Woodfin and Weaverville.

At CBG, the name hasn't changed, but it's a wholly new restaurant Fried snacks, well-mixed cocktails and the cheeseburger are all excellent bets on the imaginative, eclectic menu.

Texto completo: Nobody agrees on the best way to describe CBG.
Before new co-owners Jason Loring (Nosh, Slab) and Mike Fraser (Bramhall) renovated the space late last year, the stalwart Portland pub was known for its rustic, no-frills design sensibility. Seventeen years of grit and spilled beer left behind craggy accretions of wear and tear. "Lovably rough," is what a good friend used to say about it.
Today, the dÃ©cor - apart from the pitted, red-and-cream checkerboard linoleum flooring - looks much more inviting. Loring and Fraser demolished a wall that ran down the restaurant's equator, replacing it with a 15-seat communal table set with blue-vinyl-upholstered Atomic-age barstools that crouch underneath. To open up the space further, the pair covered the dark, constricting scarlet walls with '60s-era wood paneling.
Then came the quirky touches: a Zima sign, an oversized Big Lebowski print, a promotional Coors diorama with an inset clock that teasingly blinks only the last two digits of the time, and - menacing passersby through the plate-glass front window - a taxidermied bear cub.
"I call it a place to grab a beer and shake the cold off while we wait to get some seeds in the ground for the spring," chef Theodore Moffitt ventured. "You know, it's comfortable and pseudo-funky."
Bar manager/GM Mike Barbuto went even further, stressing CBG's working-class eclecticism: "It's so hard to describe, but I think of it like a Legion Hall, or a lodge, or a post. It's created like a time warp, with a retro-vibe and feel to it, but it's a relaxing spot."
On my second visit last week, my dinner guest and I tried our hand at summing up the visual language of the place. "Honestly," she laughed, "I wouldn't even know where to start."
We eventually settled on a cross between the diner in "Twin Peaks" and the basement playroom from "Stranger Things."
There's method to this visual madness. CBG wields its quirks strategically, defying customers to predict what's around the corner or on the next page of the menu. Indeed, it's hard to imagine finding yourself bored nursing one of Barbuto's well-mixed modern or vintage cocktails, tucking into a plate of hand-cut Maine French fries ($5) or nuclear chicken wings ($12/$22) showered in smoked paprika and a mixture of three kinds of hot sauce that Moffitt refers to as his "NAFTA house blend."
Even menu items that appear to be standard bar food are goosed to life by original culinary twists. Take the omelette-topped Hangtown Fry Cheeseburger ($16), a riff on a debauched breakfast platter made famous during the California Gold Rush. Here, a seeded potato bun barely holds back the umami tsunami inside: a ground chuck patty, thick-cut slab bacon, smoky chipotle mayonnaise and a juicy, deep-fried oyster. Or crisp-tender croquettes flush with fine shreds of braised pork and chunks of fluffy Maine potato ($9). Served magma-hot and aromatic, they will tempt you before they are cool enough to eat. If you just can't wait (you cannot), give them a dip in extra-thick aioli buzzed together with A1 steak sauce. You'll still burn yourself, but you'll go back for another.
Still, my favorite of CBG's fried finger foods is exclusively available during weekend brunch times, when a fiery, vodka-powered Bloody Mary ($10) or tart-and-floral Mezcal-based Maximillion Affair ($11) seems like the most efficient way to reboot after a night out. Then, and only then, can you get stuck into a portion of crunchy ham-and-cheese fritters ($9), doused with an optional dash of Cholula hot sauce and drooling with extra-sharp Cabot cheddar. It's like eating a croque monsieur on the beach in Puerto Vallarta.
Elsewhere on the menu, there are a few stumbles. The toasted tuna reimagines what a classic Nicoise salad might look like as a European-style, barely dressed sandwich. But between the savory, white anchovy aioli and chopped black olives, the dish is too salty. Worse, with no vinaigrette, no lettuce and barely a fleck of tomato on the plate, there is none of the traditional salad's acid and natural sweetness to create balance.
The charred cabbage and tempeh larb salad ($12) is just as off-kilter, but here, it is an almost total lack of herbs and an overwhelming dose of acid from pickled radish slices and lime juice that undo the dish. It's a pity, because I admire the creative flourishes that suffuse this vegan version of a Thai standard, from tempeh blitzed finely to resemble the ground meat that forms the backbone of a larb, to the house-prepared toasted rice powder that paints a papery layer of bitterness and glutamic zing across the salad. Knock back the acid by 25 percent and triple the herbs, and this has the potential to become a CBG signature.
"I was going to order that," one of the black-hoodied party next to me said, gesturing toward my mostly uneaten larb and pausing his animated disagreement over whether a friend's band counts as "metal." Glancing down at his own plate, he continued, "I always just play it safe and get a burger, but sometimes I just want to try the weird stuff." he said. "What was that like?"
I opened my mouth to answer, but honestly, I didn't even know where to start.

TRUTH AND TRUTH IN MOVIES AND US

Texto completo: he fact is I am quite happy in a movie, even a bad movie."
So wrote the indispensable Walker Percy in "The Moviegoer."
Me too.
But for me, going to a movie means going to a theater, buying a Coke and popcorn or a hot dog, watching 40 minutes of previews, having the experience of the lights coming down, watching the film with others - strangers - and staying to the end of the credits. That's when the lights come back up and the world is no longer held at bay.
Going to the movies means the whole experience - the gestalt, if you'll pardon the expression. I think I have finally convinced my youngest son, a videographer and documentarian, of this.
My wife and I go to the movies a lot and we have noticed lately the high and seemingly increasing number of stories "based on actual events."
Often, 50% of the previews we see are based on the actual.
"Based on" is the operative phrase. Hollywood has always used the factual story as a basis from which to fictionalize. But I notice a greater range of truth in recent stories - from zero to 100 instead of zero to 50.
Does it matter? I think so. Because we are seeing the reflection of a profound and deep disrespect for fact, data and the art of skepticism.
Movies have always spun yarns and fictionalized from a basis of real events. But I think there is a right and wrong way to do it. The base ought to be honest. And the lines of fiction - where they begin and end - clear. Great film, including great documentaries, should never serve a propaganda machine.
Now it is not a new insight: Truth seems to be more than ever up for grabs these days. The right says it. The left says it. In the impeachment trial, both sides said the other side lied and rigged the game. There are people who still maintain that Hillary Clinton did not carry the popular vote in 2016 and people who still say Barack Obama is a Muslim.
The war on truth is often blamed on Donald Trump, who gained his first visibility in politics by asserting an untruth he surely knew was an untruth - that Mr. Obama was born in Kenya.
But I think the war on truth is more complicated than that, and deeper than one movement or one man.
It's about all of us.
We don't seem to be able to agree that global warming is real.
Or that Joe Biden's son got rich based on self-dealing and unearned connections.
Or that hearsay, whether about Bernie Sanders or Brett Kavanaugh, is not evidence.
Great swaths of the media and the writing press have deeply compromised themselves by becoming openly partisan at a time when journalism - serious, curated journalism - struggles to stay alive and to find an audience and a commercial basis.
This goes to the top of establishment journalism, and it is, at once, comic, pathetic and tragic. Try to find a down-the-middle story about Mr. Trump in The New York Times or Washington Post. Or consider the recent CNN hit job on Bernie Sanders: He was forced to deny something he was accused of saying by an unnamed source and instead of seeking some sort of confirmation of the accusation, the network treated it as gospel and essentially called the senator a liar.
At the root of all this I think is a deeper crisis, both epistemological and ontological: The popular hunger has shifted from "give us facts to help us find truth" to "give us affirmation to help us bond with the like-minded."
Instead of "the truth shall set us free," we have "my truth affirms me."
Our movies reflect this. Take the recent film "The Two Popes," about Pope Francis and his predecessor, Pope Benedict. It's a pleasant little film. But nothing important in it is truth or Truth. The two men did not have a friendship before the succession. The old pope did not set up the papacy for the new pope. Benedict did not tell Francis he was resigning before he told the world - over pizza and orange soda shared in ancient sacred space. Pope Benedict was not, so far as we know, an abettor of a notorious child abuser - an unforgivable slander. Indeed, Benedict is a sort of cartoon character in the film, whereas Francis is real, human and heroic. This is the broad contextual lie built on specific lies.
Ah, but it's a movie, you say. Movies are fables. Yes, and they commonly conflate characters and dramatize events.
But this film was not about two mythical or fictional popes. It was about two actual, known, named people.
In "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood," a character based on journalist Tom Junod, who really did write a famous profile of Fred Rogers and really did become his friend, was changed to an invented character called Lloyd Vogel. That's because the makers of the film created a daddy issue for the journalist in order to have some conflict in a film about a virtuous man who worked all the time. The name and character change was the honorable and correct thing to do.
Just as in the Clint Eastwood film "Richard Jewell," the wrong thing was done. The real-life female journalist from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution should have been replaced by a fictional composite, especially if motives and actions which could not possibly be known were to be attributed to her. In a film concerned with false accusation, a real journalist, no longer living, is essentially accused of sleeping with a source to obtain information. That's an unprovable and monumental defamation left hanging out there.
I am not against films based on real life and real persons. I recently saw a remarkable film called "Just Mercy," about a very brave man named Bryan Stevenson who went to the South out of Harvard Law School to defend prisoners on death row. Every American should see this film. It should be shown in every high school civics class, at least.
On the other hand, I recently heard that Bradley Cooper is going to make a commercial biopic about Leonard Bernstein. This made me sad. It will be well done, I am sure. But it could not possibly convey the man or what he did in a two hour entertainment. In simplification and compression the depth and texture of his life will likely be lost.
I know the task in film, as it is in biography, is to create a narrative. But when I read a biography telling me what was in Teddy Roosevelt's mind as he rode the train to Buffalo after President William McKinley's death, I know something is very wrong. Small "t" truth has been sacrificed in pursuit of Truth, and both have been lost in the process. The infinite complexity of human personality and the human story, which history and biography attempt to convey, is too often and easily reduced these days to one dimension - a Xerox copy rather than a portrait.

CALIFORNIA DREAMIN' THE GOLDEN STATE PRIMARY WILL ELEVATE THE STRONGEST IN THE DEMOCRATIC FIELD

Texto completo: EL SEGUNDO, Calif.
In Iowa, they pause for coffee at the Kum&Go convenience stores in crossroads scattered around the state. In New Hampshire, they engage voters in school gymnasiums and on town street corners. Here they appear on television.
They've been doing it this way for a third of a century. The greatest insight in modern California political history may have come in 1986, when Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston was fending off a challenge from GOP Rep. Ed Zschau. "A campaign rally in California," Democratic political strategist Robert Shrum said at the time, "is three people sitting around a television set."
Today, Mr. Shrum is the director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California. Perched in the state that cultivates change - that has made change the enduring characteristic of its culture - he believes little has changed.
Two weeks from now, California and 13 other states hold "Super Tuesday" contests awarding a third of the delegates required to win the Democratic presidential election. Campaigning in the most important primary of the most important campaign day bears no resemblance to what the other candidates did for months in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. The long-running candidates are recalibrating. Michael Bloomberg is watching his ads settle into the consciousness of California.
And though Mr. Bloomberg, reeling from a disastrous performance in the Nevada debate, may be attempting to be up close and personal with his television blitz, he is not doing it at close range and there is nothing personal about it. It isn't a peculiarity of Mr. Bloomberg. It is a peculiarity of politics here.
"People here don't go to political rallies," Mr. Shrum said the other day. "After you fight your way home at night through the traffic, the last thing you want to do is to go out and go to a rally for some politician."
That explains the Bloomberg campaign, though it doesn't explain how a California-style campaign conducted without campaigning can be, according to a poll released last week by the respected Public Policy Institute of California, in a tie for fourth place with former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who was in a virtual tie at the top of the first two contests.
But another factor explains why Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont holds a commanding lead in that poll, with 32% of those surveyed - far more than the 12% that both Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Bloomberg claim.
California, which voted Republican in six consecutive president elections between 1968 and 1988, has voted Democratic the past seven elections, from Bill Clinton in 1992 to his wife, Hillary Clinton, in 2016. Ms. Clinton defeated Donald Trump by a margin of nearly 2-to-1. Her California bulge accounted for Ms. Clinton's victory in the popular vote.
Once a bastion of conservative Republicanism, California now is a redoubt of progressivism, and Mr. Sanders suits this state just right.
This strain of modern California politics may not provide the breakthrough Mr. Bloomberg covets.
Politics here is sensitive to the inclinations of women and minorities, who have not found comfort in late-breaking stories about Mr. Bloomberg's coarseness with women and concerns about his support for "stop-and-frisk" procedures in New York. Mr. Bloomberg has apologized for the latter. The former may still sting him.
Mr. Sanders' lead is impressive, but more impressive is his 2-to-1 lead over former Vice President Joe Biden as the candidate Democratic voters think is most likely to defeat Mr. Trump.
The Sanders support here skews young. More voters 44 and younger support the Vermonter than all the other candidates combined, according to the policy institute poll. A separate survey undertaken for Tufts University's Tisch College shows Mr. Sanders leading younger voters in Texas, the second-biggest Super Tuesday delegate prize, by a substantial margin. The most intriguing element of the survey: 2 in 5 of these younger Texans plan to vote.
Perhaps. Less than half of those aged 18 to 29 voted in the 2016 general election - the only age group where a majority did not go to the polls. Earlier this month, in New Hampshire, that same demographic accounted for only one-seventh of those who voted.
Another uncertainty: late deciders. About half the New Hampshire electorate made its choice in the final days before the primary. (Mr. Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, were the principal beneficiaries of those who kept their minds open until the end.)
Jack Kerouac, like this year's presidential candidates marked by his life on the road, described California in 1957 as "wild, sweaty, important, the land of lonely and exiled and eccentric lovers come to forgather like birds, and the land where everybody somehow looked like broken-down, handsome, decadent movie actors."
In the next two weeks, presidential candidates will come here, in person or on television, to forgather like birds. Most of them will leave broken-down. For Mr. Biden, for Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, almost certainly for Ms. Klobuchar, California is the crucial crucible of this campaign. And it is the great testing ground for Mr. Sanders and for Mr. Bloomberg, two New Yorkers California dreamin'.

Texto completo: Nathan Pitzer likes to keep tabs on which Silicon Valley companies reach 100 employees. That's usually his cue.
A Lancaster native, Carnegie Mellon University graduate and San Francisco transplant, Mr. Pitzer is hunting down companies that are ready to expand. A good indicator, he said, is when they hit the 100-employee milestone or secure a big round of funding.
Once he identifies those companies, his job is to match them with the right city - encouraging them to look beyond the usual suspects like Seattle, New York City or Boston to emerging tech hubs like Pittsburgh.
"I personally want to see a city thrive. . It's like an underdog story, you kind of root for the city you really like," Mr. Pitzer said.
He is one of two Pittsburgh representatives on the ground in California, part of a growing experiment with a new nonprofit trying to connect the country through work, as Mr. Pitzer describes it.
One America Works is hoping to spread the talent, wealth and investment in tech and innovation around the country. There's certainly a lot to go around - startups created $2.8 trillion in value globally between 2016 and 2018, according to a 2019 report from Startup Genome, a research firm based in San Francisco.
To spread those dollars and future growth, One America Works wants to connect tech companies with other cities that have the qualities most important to them. That could be things like access to college graduates, a low cost of living, or a vibrant arts scene.
"Can we help facilitate companies to find cities that have the talent they're looking for?" said One America Works founder Patrick McKenna. "We can't create, but we can elevate the awareness."
One America Works received a $1 million grant from the Richard King Mellon Foundation earlier this month to expand its operations in Pittsburgh, the first official effort by the nonprofit to bring more tech jobs to what they see as under-recognized cities. Long term, it wants to expand to other cities, using Pittsburgh as a model.
The announcement follows a yearlong pilot program, which the RK Mellon Foundation also funded, that resulted in five companies moving toward creating 80 jobs in Pittsburgh, Mr. McKenna said.
Pittsburgh's tagline
Based in Austin, Texas, Mr. McKenna came across Pittsburgh as he was looking for places to invest as a venture capitalist. The city checks all the boxes that the nonprofit pitches to prospective companies, he said: high talent, low cost, high quality of life and easily accessible.
He's not the only one to come to such a conclusion. Duolingo, an East Liberty-based startup that helps people learn languages through a mobile app and is valued at more than $1 billion, famously put up a billboard in San Francisco that read, "Own a home. Work in tech. Move to Pittsburgh."
A December 2019 report from the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, a part of the Brookings Institution, ranked Pittsburgh ninth among 35 metro areas nationwide that could become booming innovation centers.
The tech industry in Pittsburgh saw a 20.7% increase in jobs between 2013 and 2018, according to data from the research arm of the real estate firm CBRE.
But it's not growing fast enough. CBRE listed Pittsburgh as a "brain drain," a term it uses to compare the number of jobs available to the number of tech graduates in an area. In other words, the 7,800 tech jobs created between 2013 and 2018 did not cover the 20,000 people who graduated with a tech degree in between 2012 and 2017, so a lot of them left.
The problem isn't new, and many stakeholders in the tech industry grumble about the number of people who come to the city to learn, practice their skills and then take their talents to a larger market.
The solution isn't just to focus on the low price tag, said Audrey Russo, Pittsburgh Technology Council president and CEO.
Instead, the city should pitch its decades of research in autonomy, its reputation as the "heartbeat" of artificial intelligence, or the support that foundations and incubators have to offer entrepreneurs.
"This is my tagline: If you want to come to a place and build something, there's no better place to build it," Ms. Russo said. "I don't have to say to you, 'Hey, it's cheap to live here.' I can say, 'There's a lot of ways that you can build your dreams.'"
'A true business proposition'
For many outsiders considering a move to Pittsburgh, the city still carries a reputation of steel, according to Stefani Pashman, CEO of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, an organization that has been pitching the city to all sorts of companies for more than 20 years.
To highlight the "Pittsburgh of today," Ms. Pashman focuses on the scale and depth of tech talent in the city - ranging from students to startups to well-known brands like Google and Facebook - and the building blocks that make up the hard-to-define quality of life metric, like the quality of the schools and the availability of outdoor activities.
She said companies are also looking to see if Pittsburgh can provide a diverse and inclusive workforce - and that isn't always easy to deliver.
"That's one of the challenges in our region," she said. "Companies that are future oriented and want to grow want to see a vibrant city across many fronts. They also want to see people that look like them and lots of different people."
To pitch the city to prospective companies, Mr. Pitzer said he generally relies on his own experiences, telling people about the Pittsburgh restaurants he likes and showing pictures of his favorite spots.
He likes to think of the whole situation as "democratizing the Amazon HQ2 process," which had cities rolling out tax breaks and advertising their greatest assets in hopes of attracting the Seattle tech giant's next headquarters. Pittsburgh - which offered Amazon about $9.7 billion in incentives, free land and even a designated space at the airport - was one of the 20 finalists but didn't get the project.
Pittsburgh isn't the only option Mr. Pitzer and his colleagues at One America plan to offer in Silicon Valley. Over time, as the nonprofit starts to work with more cities, the goal is to find a location that matches what the company is looking for, rather than pushing one mid-sized research hub over another.
"No one's looking for ownership. We all realize this is about addressing the talent issue," said Bobby Zappala, a Pittsburgh entrepreneur and investor.
As the former city coordinator for One America Works, Mr. Zappala was on the receiving end of interested Silicon Valley companies, responsible for sealing the deal once a company came to visit.
"Pittsburgh isn't for everybody. There isn't any place that's for everybody. There are plenty of people who will like it for what it is," Mr. Zappala said. "It's not about convincing some company to do charity. It's a true business proposition."

Texto completo: The live briefing, a format The Times has used to guide readers through all the updates on the outbreak, involves dozens of staffers. Here's how it comes together.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When accounts of a coronavirus in China first emerged in late December, editors and reporters on the International desk at The New York Times relayed developments as they would with any other story.
But on Jan. 23, after hundreds of people across several countries became infected and China decided to lock down the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, Michael Slackman, an assistant managing editor who oversees the International desk, felt the story required more aggressive coverage. He called for a daily live briefing -- a single, continually updated article online that serves as a guide through a deep and wide-ranging report.
The Times has used live briefings to cover other momentous events, like the terrorist bombings in Sri Lanka or President Trump's impeachment trial. But the coronavirus version is the longest-running 24-hour news briefing The Times has ever done. With multiple departments contributing, the live briefing extended to 31 days on Saturday and has received more than 50 million page views, with half of those coming from an international audience.
Given the fallout of the virus -- it has affected the world's health and science community, the global economy, international relations, tourism, sporting events, the arts and more -- producing the live briefing requires constant collaboration among dozens of editors, reporters and researchers around the clock and around the world.
"The rhythms of The Times used to be very tied to print," said Russell Goldman, a senior International editor based in Hong Kong. "Increasingly, we're telling a story to a global audience in multiple time zones that wants the most up-to-date news as quickly as possible."
To guide readers through the live updates, the briefing features a box of bullet points that acts as a table of contents, a link to maps that tracks the spread of the outbreak and a chart that answers basic questions such as "What is a coronavirus?" and "How worried should I be?"
At least two editors directly handle the briefing at any given time. On most days, Gillian Wong, the assistant Asia editor in Hong Kong who oversees China coverage, and Mr. Goldman produce a new briefing by compiling reports from about two dozen researchers and reporters across Asia. Then, at about 9 p.m. Hong Kong time, they hand it off to International editors in London, who continue to monitor global updates and add significant stories from Europe.
As the day winds down in London, International editors in New York take over. They look out for coronavirus news in the United States and abroad and run ideas by reporters in Hong Kong who might stay up late to offer their insight.
The team members overseeing the briefings stay in constant communication through email, multiple encrypted apps, internal chat groups, Google docs and, of course, the phone.
"Readers want to know so many different things," said Kim Fararo, one of the deputy editors on the International desk in New York. "It's got to be a collaboration or we won't be able to answer people well."
The briefings on the virus fall under the purview of the International desk but also feature regular contributions from Science, Business, National, Metro, Sports, Travel and Culture. The list of contributors at the bottom of the briefing grows longer every day, Mr. Goldman said. One report credited up to 30 or so writers.
Chris Buckley and Amy Qin have reported from the center of the crisis in Wuhan, along with the help of a researcher, Elsie Chen. Motoko Rich, the Tokyo bureau chief, has written extensively on the thousands of passengers who were quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan, while Paul Mozur and Raymond Zhong, two technology reporters who have worked from Shanghai, have reported on China's efforts to restrict the movements of 1.4 billion people as part of its vast containment effort.
Sui-Lee Wee, a Beijing-based correspondent, traveled to Singapore to celebrate the Lunar New Year in mid-January. Within two weeks, the total number of cases rose to 10,000 from roughly 40. She decided to stay put and has been writing health care articles for the briefing as well as larger features. "I'm kind of living out of two suitcases," she said.
Several reporters and editors -- some of whom have been at The Times for more than a decade -- said the coronavirus is the largest story they have worked on. And it continues to evolve.
"Much about the virus remains a mystery," Ms. Wong said. "Our plans have to be ready to adapt at a moment's notice."
If the virus continues to spread, the live briefing will most likely continue, said Megan Specia, an International editor in London.
"As long as there is a need for this to keep going," she said, "it will keep going."

Texto completo: New York Times listeners are a curious bunch.

The full conversation, excerpted here, is available at nytimes.com/popcast.New York Times listeners are a curious bunch.

The full conversation, excerpted here, is available at nytimes.com/popcast.
JON CARAMANICA Here's a question. After watching "Miss Americana," do you think that Taylor Swift thinks "Reputation" is a good record? JOE COSCARELLI I think she thinks it's an underwhelming record, and she's wrong. CARYN GANZ It's not her best album, though. COSCARELLI I just mean the world told her it was a bad Taylor Swift album. CARAMANICA Yes, and she believed it. We are here to remind everybody, Taylor's wrong. But here's another question: Are comeback records a thing of the past now that radio has less control over what music is popular? GANZ I would say that the fans will declare a comeback record if the radio doesn't. CARAMANICA Could Adele have a comeback record? GANZ No, because she has nothing to come back from. CARAMANICA I would love to hear your honest take on how Katy Perry got to where she is now, and is there any room for her to make a sizable comeback in this fragmented streaming landscape? What did she do wrong, or was wrong done to her? GANZ It's complicated. I could say something very reductive, which would be: She stopped working with Max Martin. COSCARELLI And Dr. Luke. GANZ The pendulum will swing again, and we're going to want something a little more positive. COSCARELLI But she will have aged out. Something that Taylor really puts her finger on in "Miss Americana" is basically pop radio doesn't play women over 35 unless you're Beyoncé.

Texto completo: Muse and martyr, Jean Seberg and her tragic career are reflected and refracted in avant-garde films.
Jean Seberg (1938-79) began her career playing a martyr and ended it being one.
She was barely out of high school when she was plucked from Marshalltown, Iowa, and cast as the lead in Otto Preminger's "Saint Joan" (1957). The movie was a catastrophe. Fleeing Hollywood, Seberg became the poster girl for the French new wave in Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 "Breathless," was exploited by her imperious husband, the French novelist Romain Gary, then, hounded to the brink of madness by the F.B.I. for her public support of the Black Panthers, she died at age 40, in an apparent suicide.
Ever since, the actress has been something of an artist's muse. "Seberg," the new Kristen Stewart vehicle, isn't the first work to recount Seberg's travails. Margia Kramer used her F.B.I. files as the basis for a 1981 video installation at the Museum of Modern Art; the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes took Seberg as the subject of a roman à clef, and the independent filmmaker Mark Rappaport made the most meta of biopics in his 1996 work, "From the Journals of Jean Seberg."
Rappaport might be considered the original "VCRchaeologist," using clips from old movies as a form of critical analysis. Following his 1992 experimental documentary, "Rock Hudson's Home Movies," "From the Journals" offers a mock subjective account of Seberg's film career, blending onscreen performance with imagined autobiography and a soupçon of film theory. Mary Beth Hurt -- a native of Marshalltown for whom the teenage Seberg actually babysat -- stands in as the actress, annotating her movies from beyond the grave. "Who on earth would follow this drum majorette into battle?" she asks after watching a 17-year-old Seberg, brandishing a sword.
The voice is Hurt's. The amused, snarky tone -- Seberg refers to her torturous marriage to Gary as "a low rent version of Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller" -- belongs to Rappaport. Still, words can barely describe the humiliation Seberg suffered while playing her husband's debased caricature in his exploitative feature "Birds in Peru" (1968), or the injuries, physical as well as psychological, she sustained filming "Saint Joan."
Rappaport maintains that "the major and most interesting part of film history is gossip," something he is pleased to deliver. But "From the Journals" is also an educated account of Seberg's rise and fall, putting her in the context of two contemporary actresses -- Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave, also excoriated for their outspoken politics -- as well as an entertaining illustrated lecture on film theory.
For Rappaport, Seberg is "the first modern star." As directed by Godard in "Breathless," she not only plays herself but openly returns the camera's gaze. Her performance strikes Rappaport as the equivalent of an Andy Warhol "screen test," in which a subject simply is before the camera.
Film history, for Rappaport, has its own mysterious logic. He enjoys the absurdity of Clint Eastwood's performance opposite Seberg in the 1969 Western musical "Paint Your Wagon." (As noted by the New York Times reviewer Vincent Canby, "they are not singers by the stretch of anybody's imagination.") But Rappaport relishes even more the coincidence that both actors enjoyed their first real success in Europe before their careers took vastly different trajectories. Elsewhere, the filmmaker uses Gary's claim that he was fathered by the Russian actor Ivan Mosjoukine outside of marriage as a pretext to discuss the development of Soviet montage.
"Journals" is also an exercise in creative editing. The movie concludes with an Oscar-worthy homage, cutting from Seberg's scene interviewing Jean-Pierre Melville in "Breathless" on the subject of immortality to a collage of close-ups consumed by flames and underscored by Juliette Greco's moody rendition of the theme from Preminger's "Bonjour Tristesse" of 1958, Seberg's follow-up to "Saint Joan."
"Breathless" aside, Rappaport salvages the reputations of two underappreciated movies from the wreck of Seberg's career, "Bonjour Tristesse" and Robert Rossen's psychological drama, "Lilith" (1964). "Bonjour Tristesse" works in part, Rappaport argues, because as a confusedly dissolute teenager vacationing in the South of France, Seberg was playing a character close to her own age and situation.
"Lilith," a Hollywood art film which had its premiere at the 1964 New York Film Festival, gave Seberg her juiciest role, that of a bewitching patient with schizophrenia -- variously taunting, seductive, witchy, and childlike -- with the power to drive men mad, notably a mental hospital attendant (oafishly played by Warren Beatty) and an exceedingly nervous fellow patient (Peter Fonda).
But, even though the New York Times critic Bosley Crowther cited Seberg's "fresh, flighty, fearsome performance," "Lilith" flopped and afterward, the actress was confined -- not to a hospital -- but to a succession of hopeless parts in mediocre or embarrassing movies. (Ultimately, Lilith's fate would be her own.) Late in her career, however, Seberg did appear in one notable avant-garde film, comparable in its way to Rappaport's.
"Les Hautes Solitudes" is a silent and ghostly black-and-white film, "by turns alluring and alienating" as Manohla Dargis described it in her Times review. This 80-minute 1974 feature by Philippe Garrel is composed almost entirely of faces shot in close-up -- mainly those of Seberg and the actress Tina Aumont, with the chanteuse Nico making a brief appearance.
Unlit, seen without makeup, Seberg might be an actress in an Ingmar Bergman film -- or is she simply playing at being one? Although sometimes turning away, Seberg more often stares straight into the lens as if to support Rappaport's claim that she is the star who need not act to connect.
"From the Journals of Jean Seberg" is available on Fandor , Kanopy and YouTube . "Bonjour Tristesse" streams on YouTube , Vudu and Google Play . "Lilith" is available on Amazon Prime Video , Vudu and other sites. "Les Hautes Solitudes" can be found on Mubi .

[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The fifth season of "Better Call Saul" lands on AMC, while a new documentary on the basketball star Dwyane Wade debuts on ESPN.
What's on TV
BETTER CALL SAUL 10 p.m. on AMC. When the fourth season of this "Breaking Bad" prequel wrapped up in 2018, The New York Times's David Segal expressed high hopes for Season 5 in his recap. "All of the major characters are on the verge of becoming even more compelling," he wrote, "and as 'Better Call Saul' merges with the timeline of its chronological successor, it will get only more interesting." Alas, Season 5 is here, and it opens with the small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) settling into his new practice as Saul Goodman -- the sleazy lawyer to the guilty we first met in "Breaking Bad." This episode kicks off with a black-and-white glimpse at the future and then returns to the present, where Saul's new life proves problematic for his relationship with his girlfriend, Kim (Rhea Seehorn). The series will air in its regular time slot, Mondays at 9 p.m., starting Feb. 24.
DISNEY FAM JAM 8:25 p.m. on Disney. Spending the night in with the kids? Tune into this new dance competition series, hosted by Trevor Tordjman and Ariel Martin of the Disney television movie "Zombies 2." The choreographer Phil Wright coaches two families who then go head-to-head on the dance floor, whipping out their best moves for the chance to win a $ 10,000 cash prize.
MASTERPIECE: SANDITON 9 p.m. on PBS. This eight-part series, a loose adaptation of Jane Austen's final, incomplete novel, comes to a close with a tense Midsummer Ball, filled with the hallmarks of gripping television drama: romance, jealousy and betrayal.
D. WADE: LIFE UNEXPECTED (2020) 9 p.m. on ESPN. On Saturday, the three-time N.B.A. champion Dwyane Wade became the fifth Miami Heat player to have his number retired by the team. The occasion was the highlight of a three-day celebration of Wade's roughly 14 years with the Heat. This new documentary takes a look back at Wade's life with a more intimate tone. Shot over the past decade, it features home videos of him with his family and follows his personal struggles during his final year in the league.
What's Streaming
ANNABELLE COMES HOME (2019) Stream on HBO. At the outset of this horror flick, the third installment in the possessed doll series, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) lock the Annabelle doll in a sacred glass case in their home's artifacts room. Sometime later, they're out of town on a case, leaving their daughter Judy (Mckenna Grace) in the hands of a teenage babysitter, Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman). Then Mary Ellen's friend Daniela (Katie Sarife) drops by, pokes around the artifacts room and unlocks the glass case, unleashing the doll's terrorizing spirit. Havoc ensues. The movie received mixed reviews, the consensus being that it wasn't as frightening as its predecessors. Yet it may be worthy of a watch for fans of typical haunted house fare.

Texto completo: We often write about students and education, quoting students, but for this issue of Learning we wanted to hear from them directly. We went to Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, which has nearly 2,000 students in grades nine through 12, and asked more than a dozen of them to answer the following questions: What would you change about your education? What are your education goals? What is the biggest challenge for you in terms of your education? Their answers have been edited and condensed. To watch videos of their responses, go to nytimes.com/section/education/learning Photographs by Emon Hassan for The New York Times
Samiyah Brown, 17, 12th grade
Being a senior is stressful when you've got to do college applications, SAT scores, college recommendation letters. Being a senior, you're going to get this "senioritis," because you think you're basically done with high school. But you're not done until you walk across that stage and get your diploma with that cap and gown on.
Cheyenne Campbell, 17, 12th grade
My educational goals would definitely be to continue challenging myself critical-thinking-wise, understanding things, mastering and maneuvering through things, even life just itself.
Kayla Collier, 17, 12th grade
My educational goals are to apply the skills I learned in school into real-life situations, and to also be able to pass that knowledge on to other people.
Kha Nhi Duong, 19, 12th grade
I am very satisfied with my education now, because I did not receive, or have the experience with, education like this before, and so now I'm very happy and I don't want to change anything about my education.
Sierra Duncan, 17, 12th grade
I'm almost done with high school, and I think I personally have come a long way, so that's something I would like to complete as soon as possible. And on time. One of my long-term goals would be going to college and graduating with my bachelor's in animal science.
Daneel Dushin, 15, 10th grade
The biggest challenge in my education is finding a good degree and a path that would be beneficial for myself, financially, and finding a degree that would be able to interpret my creativity and my musical aspect.
Roberlin Espinal Torres, 16, 10th grade
I want to have a good job, to go to college, have a good career, have a good job, so I don't have to throw out my back working.
Zachary Gordon, 19, 12th grade
My educational goal is to, after high school, go to college and study education so I can become a teacher, because I feel like the teaching job is a great job, and I'd like to be the teacher who can contribute to the future generation.
Steffi Greene, 18, 12th grade
I've noticed in the last few years, education has become more about the ABC's on our multiple choice tests than me grasping a subject in class. And if I don't grasp a subject and others do, they'll move on and I'll never get the chance to learn it myself unless I do it myself.
Zacckary Hinds, 17, 12th grade
I want to go to college and nursing school and become a good nurse, because I want to follow the trade of my mother in the medical field.
Sherrell Lee, 14, ninth grade
I admit that I wasted a lot of time in my middle school years, and I waited until I'm in high school to start improving. And I want to start very, very early in order to do the things that I want to do in the future, and have a plan and just build upon it.
Esther Richardson, 18, 12th grade
I wish we could incorporate more life skills that we would need, especially when we graduate high school. Such as paying our bills, learning how to have a good credit score, how to buy a house, how to save our money ... I'm going to need those things when I become more independent.
Kierra Shaw, 16, 11th grade
Not everybody is a test taker or a school person, and I don't think learning shoud be defined as such standard things, such as like math, science, history. I feel that learning should be more individual rather than everybody learning the same thing.
Sarit Slatvaev, 16, 11th grade
I want to go to college and major in biology. Afterward, I am planning to go to med school. Being a woman and an immigrant in today's society, I want to break many different stereotypes concerning women in STEM.
Ester Tavarez, 17, 12th grade
If I could change one thing in my education, it would be to place students in their classrooms rather than their age group. I believe that would help them open up with their other peers and connect more with them.
Esther Thomas, 18, 12th grade
I would change the timing of school. Doctors would say that a teenage brain actually wakes up at 10 o'clock. I'd change the timing for all of the grades to, like, 10 to 4.

Texto completo: Computers, fake frogs, new desks and more: a collection of views and news from our Learning special report.
This article is part of our latest Learning special report . We're focusing on Generation Z, which is facing challenges from changing curriculums and new technology to financial aid gaps and homelessness.
Biochemistry Can Be Elementary
Students generally learn about moles, atoms, compounds and the intricacies of the periodic table in college, but Daniel Fried is convinced that children can learn complex biochemistry topics as early as elementary school.
Mr. Fried is an assistant professor of chemistry at St. Peter's University in New Jersey, and in his spare time he creates biochemistry lessons for youngsters, teaching fourth through sixth graders at a nearby Montessori school and sharing lessons with other teachers and home-schooling parents around the world.
"When the kids are young, they're highly motivated," Mr. Fried said. "It's easy to teach them. They pick up on the patterns so quickly. They appreciate everything." High school and college students, by contrast, take a lot more work to engage and tend to want to learn only what they need to pass a test, he said.
Mr. Fried has found getting children interested in biochemistry to be a breeze -- especially when they hear they will soon be able to correct older siblings or cousins. "The harder part is getting the adults on board to allow it to happen," he said.
At Hopatcong Middle School in northern New Jersey, Jim McKowen is one of the first public school teachers to take on this curriculum. He teaches it to sixth graders. After a lesson where students learn about flavor molecules, Mr. McKowen said, students go home and scour ingredient labels for chemicals they recognize. Children doodle molecules in their school notebooks after his class, he said.
Mr. Fried has introduced biochemistry to students of various ethnic and socioeconomic groups in schools and museums, finding that all of them happily grapple with the curriculum. Girls are as interested in these lessons as boys, he said, although men tend to dominate STEM fields.
Both teachers think the curriculum could bring more diversity to STEM. "Hopefully it does translate into a greater interest in science later in life and we start to see those results," Mr. McKowen said.
To get there, though, teachers have to believe children are capable of more than they may think.
"We do sell kids short sometimes," Mr. McKowen said. TARA GARCÍA MATHEWSON
The Frogs Are Fake. The Lessons Are Real.
Dissection day always made Karina Frey queasy. Even though she called herself a "science and math girl," she did not like the idea of cutting into a chemically preserved animal.
"I believe that animals have souls, too," said Karina, a senior at J.W. Mitchell High School in New Port Richey, Fla.
With vegetarianism and environmental concerns on the rise among young people, the option of learning on something that did not have to die for that purpose is increasingly attractive.
Enter SynFrog: an amphibian that is as slimy as a real frog but has never drawn a breath.
The anatomically accurate fake frog made its debut at Karina's high school in November. It met with avid approval from biology teachers and students, according to the school's principal, Jessica Schultz. The school usually goes through about 300 frogs a year, she said, and several students in each class always opt out of the assignment.
Three million frogs are harvested each year for classroom dissections in the United States, according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which partnered with the manufacturing company SynDaver to develop the synthetic frog.
At $ 150, the first SynFrog was more expensive than a frog carcass ( $ 7 to $ 10 each); the company hopes to reduce the price in the next version. As the frog is reusable for most dissections, the cost could be recouped over time.
Since the frog's debut, the company has had trouble filling orders fast enough, according to its chief executive and founder, Christopher Sakezles. If SynFrog catches on, it could change a staple of high school education. MEREDITH KOLODNER
Students Like Tech, but Also Teachers
Children like technology. They like playing games, watching videos, finding music and interacting with their peers on social media. They like exploring the endless resources of the internet.
Educators notice this and assume that computers and other devices will capture students' interest in school.
Ninety-three percent of principals and 86 percent of teachers say that increased student engagement is the most important benefit of using computers and tablets in classrooms, according to the latest data from the Speak Up Research Initiative, which surveyed more than 26,000 teachers and librarians and almost 2,200 administrators last year.
Nearly 70 percent of district administrators said they considered engagement to be the most effective sign that a piece of educational technology is useful.
Speak Up got a very different response from the roughly 290,000 students it surveyed: Just 41 percent of middle school students and 35 percent of high school students said they strongly associated classroom technology with increased engagement.
What is more, anecdotal interviews, along with data from YouthTruth, a national nonprofit that conducts student surveys, indicate that many students actually dislike when teachers turn over instruction to computers. They say they prefer learning directly from teachers -- because they think teachers are the experts or that it's their job -- and many complain about spending too much time on screens, between their schoolwork and their use of technology at home.
Gen Z may walk through life glued to smartphones, but that does not mean they want to use computers in class. TARA GARCÍA MATHEWSON
A Work College Makes Room for Growth
With the average cost of college now about $ 20,000 annually at public and $ 41,000 at private institutions, many students have jobs to help cover costs. But at nine institutions federally designated as work colleges, working is incorporated into the curriculum to offset tuition and fees. Paul Quinn College, a historically black college in Dallas, became the newest work college in 2017, and the only urban one. Now, it is expanding.
"We're not one of those schools that's overstaffed," said Michael Sorrell, the college's president. "A lot of the jobs that other schools might hire people to do, we've invested in the students to do."
Classes are primarily held Monday, Wednesday and Friday, leaving Tuesday and Thursday for students to work uninterrupted. They work in the president's office, on the campus farm (where they grow radishes, arugula, spinach, kohlrabi and more) and off campus at businesses such as JP Morgan Chase and Liberty Mutual.
The model clearly works well for Paul Quinn. The retention rate for first-year, full-time students rose to 71 percent in the 2017-18 year from 63 percent before the change. Two buildings are scheduled to open this summer so enrollment can grow beyond the roughly 500 students it has now. One is a residence hall, the other a gym and wellness center with classroom space.
And, having added a new campus in nearby Plano in 2018, school leaders are searching for the next site. "I think you will see another campus within the next three years," Mr. Sorrell said. DELECE SMITH-BARROW
Out: Rows of Desks. In: Flexible Design.
School desks neatly lined up in rows may soon be a relic. Districts across the country are pouring millions of dollars into redesigning classrooms, trading the traditional layout for beanbags, rocking chairs and furniture on wheels. The North American school furniture market is expected to grow to $ 2.4 billion by 2024 from $ 1.7 billion in 2018 as technology-driven change increases the demand for more flexible classroom space.
Bryan Ballegeer of KI, a Wisconsin-based school furniture company, says school administrators tell him: "We've been sitting in the same chairs for 40 years, and our school system is changing. We don't want any one part of the room to be the front of the room. We want our kids to collaborate more."
In response, KI eliminated some of its desk/chair combos. Its catalog now includes standing or counter-height tables where students can work in teams and couches where they can settle in to read.
To figure out if its furniture helped learning, KI redesigned some classrooms in nine schools and gave a before-and-after survey to students and teachers. Both groups reported higher levels of engagement and participation after the furniture swap. Other research backs up the idea that changing a classroom's physical characteristics can change what happens in it and improve student performance.
Still, Mr. Ballegeer, a former educator, offered a cautionary note.
"My advice is take a moment, talk with your teachers, talk with your community," he said. "It's a big expense." SARAH BUTRYMOWICZ

Texto completo: He incurred the wrath of the dictator Augusto Pinochet, was exiled, and became an expert in how to heal traumatized countries.
José Zalaquett, a Chilean lawyer who investigated human rights abuses during Augusto Pinochet's regime -- spending time in prison and in exile as a result -- and then helped bring to light similar abuses elsewhere in the Americas as well as in Africa and the Middle East, died on Feb. 15 in Santiago, Chile's capital. He was 77.
His daughter Valeria Zalaquett said the cause was Parkinson's disease.
Mr. Zalaquett was admired not only for his efforts in Chile in the 1970s, when standing up to Pinochet was an act of courage, but also for his work years later in helping that country come to grips with its past after its return to democracy in 1990. He was a key figure on the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, writing much of its 1991 report, which detailed abuses under the dictatorship and suggested how to guard against a recurrence.
That became an area of expertise for him, not just in relation to Chile but to any country -- Argentina, South Africa, Panama -- that faced the challenge of restoring order and justice after a period of war or oppression.
Cristián Correa, a senior staff member at the International Center for Transitional Justice, a human rights group on whose advisory board Mr. Zalaquett served, was one of many to post tributes to him after his death. He "helped pioneer the field of transitional justice and inspired countless human rights defenders around the globe," Mr. Correa wrote.
General Pinochet seized power in September 1973 in a bloody military coup that deposed President Salvador Allende, replacing his Marxist government with a right-wing dictatorship. Thousands were detained, arrested or killed. Mr. Zalaquett was asked to lead what became known as the Vicaría de la Solidaridad, an initiative of the Roman Catholic Church and other religious institutions that defended detainees and helped families search for relatives who had disappeared.
"We soon had a staff of more than 70 people and began to establish legal strategies, mainly habeas corpus writs," Mr. Zalaquett said in an interview posted on the website of the organization Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. "Although we lost virtually every case" -- the judiciary being unwilling to challenge the military junta -- "we knew that we had to continue. The process itself was important."
In 1975 Mr. Zalaquett was jailed and released. Then, in April 1976, he was jailed again, though not for long.
"I was taken directly from prison to the airport," he said, "where the guards even buckled my seatbelt and sent me into exile."
He was sent to France and later settled in the United States. He became a leading figure in Amnesty International and continued to try to bring attention to the abuses in Chile, calling on the American government to exert pressure.
"If the United States is sincere in its professed dedication to human rights," he wrote in an essay in The New York Times in 1976, "it must reconsider its foreign aid policy toward Chile."
He was permitted to return to Chile in 1986, and in 1990, after Pinochet relinquished the presidency, his successor, Patricio Aylwin, named Mr. Zalaquett to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He later advised similar groups, including South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which dealt with the end of apartheid.
Rebuilding a just political system, he knew, was a delicate process.
"Every step of this transitional process takes on symbolic value and has lasting effects," he said. "Truth is important. Justice is important. Forgiveness is, too."
But he did not favor blanket amnesty for those who had committed abuses, as some of Pinochet's supporters urged.
"The individual must atone for sins that have been committed and make reparations," he said. "In this manner, it is as if the sinner is putting back the brick he took from the moral building."
A blanket amnesty without this acknowledgment "only serves to validate human rights abuses," he said.
"There is no truth, no repentance -- just cynicism."
José Fernando Zalaquett Daher was born on March 10, 1942, in Antofagasta, Chile, to Michel Zalaquett, a shop owner, and Ernestina Daher. He earned a law degree in 1967 at the University of Chile in Santiago.
After Allende was elected in 1970, Mr. Zalaquett worked for two years in his administration. Those years, he later admitted, were not without problems.
"We were idealistic and well meaning, but we were young and irresponsible, and everybody acknowledges that now," he told The Times in 2003. "To attempt a social revolution went against the grain of this country."
By 1973, when the coup took place, he had left the government and was a university administrator.
"Those who knew that I was a lawyer approached me and asked for my help in finding their imprisoned or disappeared relatives," he said. "Learning that the churches were organizing to provide some relief, I joined them."
He particularly ran afoul of Pinochet in March 1976, when Mr. Zalaquett met with three members of the United States House of Representatives who had traveled to Chile to investigate reports of human rights abuses. He was exiled a month later.
During his exile he served as chairman of the International Executive Committee of Amnesty International. He later became the organization's deputy secretary general.
From 2000 to 2005, he was a member of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. He also taught at several institutions, including the University of Chile.
Mr. Zalaquett's marriage to María Pía Fuentealba, in 1966, ended in divorce. In 2003 he married Dianora Contramaestre. In addition to his wife and his daughter Valeria, from his first marriage, he is survived by another daughter from that marriage, Daniela Zalaquett, and four grandchildren.
Mr. Zalaquett's thinking on how to pursue reconciliation and justice after a period of national trauma has influenced countless people who have worked in that field.
"He often described transitional justice as an icebreaker," Mr. Correa wrote in his tribute, "which works best when it strikes the ice at its weakest point and cracks it; the crack can then be widened further until it opens up a clear path to sustainable peace and justice."
But the process, Mr. Zalaquett said in a talk at Stanford University in 2010, is a complex one that has yet to be perfected.
"It's a human endeavor, and human endeavors fail more than they succeed," he said. "Which is all the more reason to try over and over again."

Texto completo: His debate performance was abysmal. But it seems that Americans are eager to give billionaires a second chance.
The conventional wisdom around Wednesday night's presidential debate gelled almost immediately, adhering as if Gorilla Glue to the various deficiencies of Michael R. Bloomberg's performance: He made a terrible case for himself; Elizabeth Warren was pulverizing him. That he did not appear to expect this level of combat from a former Harvard Law School professor so ideologically opposed to his worldview was perhaps the clearest indicator of his arrogance.
Even allowing for the understanding that rich men, rarely subject to challenge, will not necessarily hold up ably under interrogation, Mr. Bloomberg still succeeded in surprising us with his lack of preparation, his unchecked peevishness and a hesitancy that must have embarrassed him most of all, given how thoroughly it put the viewer in the mind of middle management.
For someone who built his political image on his unsurpassed authority, this was a particularly bad outcome. Three of the four times Mr. Bloomberg has run for political office, he has cast himself as a gifted agent of crisis control.
In 2002, he offered himself as the only mayoral candidate who could revive the economic fortunes of New York City in the aftermath of 9/11. Seven years later, when he ran for mayor a third time, a move that required a bit of dodgy legislative bullying, he sold himself as the only viable option for settling the soil after the eruptions caused by the financial crash the previous year.
Now Mr. Bloomberg (a lifelong Democrat who became a Republican to run for mayor of New York, then became an independent and who has recently switched back to the Democratic Party) is putting himself forward to the American public as the best possible vehicle for releasing the country from the chaos of the Trump era. But if you believe that the current crisis has its deepest roots in grave deficits of compassion, then his debate showing gave you little reason to be persuaded that he is the shepherd poised to take the country to a different place.
Several hours before Wednesday night's spectacle, I found myself on a street corner with a friend who said he would secretly be thrilled for a Bloomberg presidency. He was speaking in the spirit of confession because this is not the sort of thing liberals say in Brooklyn.
In truth, among New Yorkers of a certain kind -- left leaning, materially comfortable in progressive enclaves, near or at middle-age -- there has been an uneasy nostalgia for Mr. Bloomberg long before he entered the presidential contest.
His fraught mayoral tenure is now regarded (notably by those who couldn't abide it in the moment) with a wistfulness for its efficiency and surface shine. Even his insistence on a third and final act -- what seemed like such an egregious gesture of entitlement at the time -- has come to look like a noble brand of civic fealty when held up against his successor's halfhearted, absentee approach to the day-to-day operation of the city.
The former mayor has become, in a sense, the boyfriend you failed to appreciate when he was around -- the guy who could be gruff, insensitive, colossally self-regarding but who also tidied up and kept house rather nicely. In his own way, he took care of you -- for all those years, 12 of them. You could not accuse him of having a problem with commitment. And he bought you things -- didn't he? -- at least when you weren't needy or begging.
How this local shift in perception could affect his current political prospects is unclear -- New York is hardly known for swaying presidential elections. But it suggests that opinions of Michael Bloomberg are mutable -- in some part because he is many things at once but also because his presentation lacks either the emotion or the phoniness to inspire visceral feelings one way or the other.
As it happened, on the day of the debate The Times published an opinion piece by Shira A. Scheindlin, the former federal judge who presided over the 2013 lawsuit that effectively ended the city's stop-and-frisk program, ruling that the tactics violated the constitutional rights of people of color. As mayor, Mr. Bloomberg fought the suit after aggressively expanding the protocols. He apologized for the racist policy only in advance of his entry in the presidential race.
But Ms. Sheindlin was not writing to excoriate him; to the contrary, she wanted the world to know that she did not think that he was racist. She then cited the many opportunities Mr. Bloomberg created for minorities with a clarity the candidate himself was unable to summon at the debate.
In retrospect, it is easy to imagine that Mr. Bloomberg and his police captains were the only ones slow to recognize the indignity of halting the free movement of young black and brown men -- first on the premise that they might be carrying guns, and then on the basis that they were walking around with weed, inexplicably viewed as equally threatening to the social order.
In an August 2012 New York Times poll, though, at a point when close to 330,000 stops had already been recorded that year, a higher percentage of respondents said they found the practice of stop-and-frisk "acceptable" than those who found it "excessive." Even after racially dubious video clips of Mr. Bloomberg emerged last week, he somehow polled significantly higher with African-Americans -- and women -- than Elizabeth Warren did.
The same poll, of Democrats and independents inclined toward Democratic candidates, suggests that the Trump presidency has not expunged a taste for billionaires among working people. Of those making less than $ 50,000 and of those without college educations, more favored Mr. Bloomberg than any other candidate in the Democratic field save for Bernie Sanders.
The great intrigue of a general election race between the self-made billionaire and a self-proclaimed one is the promise of a matchup between two competing strains of vanity, one born of extreme confidence and the other of enduring insecurity. It's still possible we'll get to witness it.

Here to Help; 5 Cheap (ish) Things to Organize Your Desk

Texto completo: It's wise to sort through your workspace regularly. Here are some suggestions.
Since I work from home, my desk is in my living room. Although I do my best to tame clutter, I'm not great at it. Honestly, if I lived alone, I'd probably ignore the piles of unread mail and trade magazines I never get around to and the stacks of notebooks that seem to multiply overnight. But since I'm married, it's not fair to expect my husband to tolerate my workplace pigpen, especially since it's in such a high-trafficked area of our apartment.
However, I was intrigued when I came across 5S, a Japanese system for workplace organization formalized by Takashi Osada at the Toyota Motor Corporation in the early 1980s. 5S is an acronym of five Japanese words that addresses orderliness, cleanliness and discipline: seiri (sort), seiton (set in order), seiso (shine), seiketsu (standardize and shitsuke (sustain). The idea is if you make it a habit to practice each step and attend to your workspace, you'll be a more productive employee with boosted morale.
Seiri refers to act of identifying which equipment is crucial to your workplace and which equipment can be discarded or stashed away. Seiton is about deciding where this equipment should go to increase efficiency. This could mean placing your telephone near the dominant side of your body so you're not reaching across your desk to answer calls. The next three steps are devoted to cleaning the area regularly and making sure you maintain the overall system.
Whether you follow the 5S method or not, it's still wise to sort through your workspace regularly and thoughtfully store your necessities. With that in mind, in collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap (ish) items to organize your desk.
Wastebasket
I don't have a trash bin near my desk and there's really no excuse for it. Instead, I leave little bundles on the floor of things I'll toss when I head to the kitchen, which I admit, isn't ideal.
Having a sensible, lid-free wastebasket will prevent clutter and garbage from lingering in your work area. Wirecutter recommends the Brighton Professional Black Wire Mesh Square Wastebasket. Not only will it keep your workspace tidy, but the black color will also blend in with pretty much any office décor. The 4.4-gallon capacity is appropriate for most offices, and the mesh design will encourage you to regularly clear the trash can out.
Desktop organizer
Some desks don't come with drawers, so having a dedicated place to store your files and office ephemera is imperative. Wirecutter likes the sturdy Innovative Storage Designs Desktop Organizer. It has file sorters, a pencil cup and even a holder for sticky notes. What sets this apart from other desktop organizers is that you can easily store oversized items, as the storage area is open on both ends. There's also four compartments for small office supplies like pushpins, rubber bands, mini binder clips and paper clips. It comes as one piece so there's no assembly required.
Filing cabinet
Receipts, contracts, letters and periodicals may not need to live in your immediate work area, but they do need to be stowed somewhere secure. Store them in an easy-to-access filing cabinet. Wirecutter likes the affordable Lorell 14341 18″ Deep 2-Drawer File Cabinet for most home offices. Its smooth drawers and solid build made it a smart pick for any office. Since it's a vertical filing cabinet, it doesn't take up a lot of space. Wirecutter notes you should load both drawers evenly to prevent tipping.

Cable ties
Cable ties are fantastic because they're removable, reusable and won't damage cords and cables. They're also fully customizable and can be cut or combined to fit a variety of jobs, including gathering headphone cords and affixing computer cables to a table leg.
Wirecutter likes the self-gripping Velcro-Brand Thin Ties. They come in a pack of 100, which is plenty for you and your favorite officemates. Cable ties are especially useful if you have pets or small children zooming around your workspace as they will reduce tripping hazards (children) and chewing (pets).
Power strip hider
Another way to make your workspace more pleasing to the eye, is to splurge on a power strip hider. This well-designed plastic box will discreetly conceal your power strip. Wirecutter likes the Bluelounge CableBox. It is designed to fit over most surge protectors and comes in four colors -- black, white, light sage and moonlight blue -- so it can coordinate with most room designs. Pay attention to the dimensions to ensure you get a perfect fit.

Texto completo: BENGHAZI, Libya - The field marshal stares from billboards into the wreckage of the Libyan city of Benghazi. His uniform is festooned with epaulets and honors, even as the civil war he is waging has stalled into a bloody stalemate.
His plainclothes security agents loiter and listen in cafes and hotel lobbies. He has handed control of the mosques to extremist preachers. And he has showered patronage on a tribal death squad called the Avengers of Blood, blamed for a long string of disappearances and killings of his political opponents.
"We are living in a prison," said Ahmed Sharkasi, a liberal activist from Benghazi who fled to Tunis because of threats on his life.
Khalifa Hifter, the 76-year-old commander known in his dominion as "the marshal," is the military ruler of eastern Libya. He has been fighting for nearly six years to take control of the country, and he has been waging an assault on the capital, Tripoli, for the past 10 months.
The United Arab Emirates, Egypt and others have lined up behind him, and Russia has sent mercenaries. The largely powerless United Nations-sponsored government in Tripoli is defended mainly by regional militias and, recently, Turkey, which has flown in hundreds of paid Syrian fighters.
Hifter has cut off Libya's oil production for the past month to try to deprive the Tripoli government of revenue. Last week he began shelling its civilian port, killing three people, narrowly missing a ship loaded with liquefied natural gas and derailing United Nations-sponsored cease-fire talks.
Hifter has promised to build a stable, democratic and secular Libya, but he has largely shut Western journalists out of his territory. A rare visit there by a New York Times correspondent and photographer revealed an unwieldy authoritarianism that in many ways is both more puritanical and more lawless than Libya was under its last dictator, Moammar Gadhafi.
Hifter's Benghazi stronghold is a half-ruined city beset by corruption, where security agents trailed foreign journalists, residents cowered in fear of arbitrary arrest, and pro-government militias answered to no one.
Aging and distracted, Hifter is seldom seen in Benghazi. He presides from his mountain home an hour's drive to the west. He holds salons with tribal elders and depends on family as his closest advisers. Two of his sons are among his top military commanders, as well as his caretakers.
"They make sure he is well fed," said Faraj Najem, a director of a government-run research center who is close to Hifter. "They make sure he takes his medicine. They provide him with security when they are around him."
The center of Benghazi is little different today than it was in 2017, when Hifter seized it after a four-year campaign of shelling and bombing.
Neighborhoods on the periphery now bustle with newly opened stores and cafes. But the streets of the city center are crumbling.
Libya is rich with oil, but it is a volatile prize. It has been in turmoil since an Arab Spring revolt and NATO's intervention toppled Gadhafi nine years ago. Its deserts shelter Islamist militants, and its Mediterranean coastline teems with migrants.
Hifter had served as an officer in Gadhafi's army but later fled to the United States where he lived for decades as a CIA client before returning to Libya during the uprising in 2011.
He began his drive for power by promising to save Benghazi. In 2014, when Islamist militias were terrorizing the city, he vowed to declare military rule and rid the country of Islamists.
Armed by foreign sponsors, he started by recruiting fighters from local tribes and welcoming the help of former Gadhafi officers and officials.
Then he won the support of Saudi-style Islamist fighters - known as Salafists - who saw a common enemy in the rival schools of Islamists that Hifter was battling. He has never acknowledged any contradiction between his avowed hostility to political Islam and his brigades of Salafists.
The deals he struck with tribal militias, Salafists and former Gadhafi henchmen in Benghazi now threaten to run over his promises of secular law and order.
Many Benghazi residents celebrate Hifter for restoring security to the streets, an attitude reinforced in his official media. Images of Hifter's face are ubiquitous. A pro-Hifter satellite television network broadcasts his propaganda and sometimes Salafist sermons. Weekly street demonstrations, organized by the government's Office of Supporting Decisions, recall Gadhafi-era displays of forced enthusiasm.
Access to Benghazi by foreign journalists or rights groups is severely restricted. Residents must obtain official permission to travel abroad, sometimes requiring interrogation by security agents. Some are forced to submit reports about who they met outside Libya - or, sometimes, on friends and neighbors at home.
Opposition views are not welcome.
In July, a British-educated politician, Seham Sergiwa, 57, publicly questioned Hifter's assault on Tripoli. A group of armed men abducted her that night. They spray-painted a warning against criticizing the army on the wall of her house.
Her relatives outside Libya said the power was cut before the attack and police had ignored calls for help. Most family members now believe she is dead. But Benghazi authorities have told her husband that they believe she is alive and advised him to keep quiet.
"All the evidence points to Hifter," said her brother, Adam Sergiwa, a doctor living in Indiana. "We know that. Everybody knows that. He wanted to teach a lesson."
A spokesman for Hifter called the apparent killing an act of terrorism and said that his military had nothing to do with it.
Although no longer a battleground, Benghazi is hardly free of violence.
U.N. reports warn of frequent kidnappings, forced disappearances and assassinations by unknown assailants.
Responsibility for the violence is impossible to determine, but many Benghazi residents point to tribal militias that fought with Hifter.
One of the biggest sources of fighters was the Awaqir tribe. Members of the tribe now boast of their impunity, and some have claimed prime jobs in government-owned companies or even the local university.
Awaqirs formed the Avengers of Blood in 2013 to seek revenge after a deadly clash with an Islamist-leaning militia. The Avengers became known as enforcers for Hifter, widely blamed for disappearances and killings.
A spokesman for Hifter said the Avengers were unarmed civilians who collected info about "terrorists."
But during the abduction of Sergiwa, her attackers scrawled the name of the Avengers of Blood on the wall.

Texto completo: Post-impeachment purge of appointees deemed to lack fealty to president
President Trump has instructed his White House to identify and force out officials across his administration who are not seen-as sufficiently loyal, a post-impeachment escalation that administration officials say reflects a new phase of a campaign of retribution and restructuring ahead of the November election.
Johnny McEntee, Trump's former personal aide who now leads the effort as director of presidential personnel, has begun combing through various agencies with a mandate from the president to oust or sideline political appointees who have not proved their loyalty, according to several administration officials and others familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
The push comes in the aftermath of an impeachment process in which several members of Trump's administration provided damning testimony about his behavior with regard to Ukraine. The stream of officials publicly criticizing Trump's actions frustrated the president and caused him to fixate on cleaning house after his acquittal this month.
'We want bad people out of our government!' Trump tweeted Feb. 13, kicking off a tumultuous stretch of firings, resignations, controversial appointments and private skirmishes that have since spilled into public view.
The National Security Council, the State Department and the Justice Department are targets of particular focus, according to two administration officials, and-there have recently been multiple resignations and reassignments at each of those agencies.
John C. Rood, the official in charge of Defense Department policy who had certified that Ukraine had met anti-corruption obligations, was let go this week. Victoria Coates, the deputy national security adviser who was viewed with suspicion by some White House aides, was removed from her post and was moved to an advisory position in the Energy Department.
McEntee spent part of this week asking officials in various Cabinet agencies to provide names of political appointees working in government who are not fully supportive of Trump's presidency, according to administration officials.
The president instructed McEntee to find people in the administration who aren't aligned with Trump and 'get rid' of them, according to someone familiar with the president's directive.
Trump did not provide additional specificity on what exactly he wanted beyond a workforce that more fully reflects his instincts, the person said, and it is-unclear what criteria are being-used to determine an official's fealty to the president. McEntee's discussions with Cabinet agencies were first reported by Axios.
The 29-year-old former campaign aide is planning to prepare a presentation for Trump about what he has found. While Sean Doocey, the former director of presidential personnel, reported to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's deputy, McEntee reports directly to the president, according to a senior administration official.
What began as a campaign of retribution against officials who participated in the impeachment process has evolved into a full-scale effort to create an administration more fully in sync with Trump's id and agenda, according to several officials familiar with the plan. It is unclear whether civil servants will be targeted as well, but it would be harder to dislodge them than removing political appointees. Civil servants, however, could be sidelined in other ways.
As he became the third president in American history to be impeached, Trump seethed against his own appointees who defied White House lawyers to comply with congressional subpoenas and testify about his conduct. The process clarified for Trump and his top advisers that they had not focused enough on personnel in the early part of the presidency, creating a loyalty deficiency the president is moving quickly to correct, officials said.
The burgeoning effort was reflected in Trump's decision this week to appoint Richard Grenell as the next acting director of national intelligence, placing a fiercely loyal but inexperienced ally atop an intelligence structure against which the president has frequently railed.
Mulvaney used a speech this week at the Oxford Union in Britain to inveigh against the 'deep state,' and he lamented that the administration could not fire more agency employees who do not implement the president's orders. He referred to some of testimony of the witnesses who participated in Trump's impeachment inquiry.
Bureaucrats who want to make policy instead of implementing it 'should put their name on the effing ballot and run' for office, he said during remarks to a group of several hundred people, according to audio of a speech obtained by The Washington Post.
Trump's family members have been among the main champions of the effort to force out officials who have not proved their devotion to Trump.
Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior adviser in the White House, has played a central role in the push, concentrating more power in the West Wing and working to combat leaks, officials said.
Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter that the impeachment investigation was helpful in 'unearthing who all needed to be fired.'
Cliff Sims, a former White House adviser who wrote a book titled 'Team of Vipers,' about his time in the White House, has said Trump's presidency has been repeatedly undermined by disloyal underlings.
'Loyalist shouldn't be a dirty word,' he said. 'Loyalty to the duly elected president and his agenda is exactly what we should expect from our unelected appointees.'
Brendan Buck, a longtime adviser to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said that while Trump is entitled to have political appointees who support his agenda, the purity tests could make it difficult to find qualified people.
'If they also insist on hiring only people who've never taken issue with something the president has done, it's going to be slim pickings,' he said.
Trump selected Grenell, the-ambassador to Germany, to-lead the intelligence community in place of Joseph Maguire after becoming angry last week-when he learned that a U.S.-intelligence official had told-lawmakers that Russia wants to see him reelected, according to people familiar with the matter.
Grenell has moved quickly to concentrate power within the intelligence agencies. Maguire's deputy, Andrew P. Hallman, resigned Friday. Grenell hired Kash Patel, a National Security Council aide who has worked in the past to cast doubt on the FBI's investigation into Russian election interference. Grenell has requested access to information from the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, the New York Times reported, citing two-people familiar with the matter.
The moves reflect the skeptical view the president has had of-the intelligence community after his campaign's links to Russia were investigated and several of his associates were prosecuted.
The anger extends beyond the intelligence agencies, and Trump has also called for law enforcement officials who investigated his campaign to be investigated or prosecuted. Even some Trump allies are feeling heat over not being aggressive enough about taking on the president's perceived enemies.
At a donor roundtable Tuesday at the Montage Hotel in Los Angeles, one participant pointedly questioned Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) on why he was not holding accountable people who were responsible for the Russia investigation.
'I see you on Fox News every night, and then you do nothing about it. What are you going to do about it?' the donor asked, according to an attendee.
'What a fantastic question!' Trump said.
Meanwhile, administration officials are conducting a search for the 'Anonymous' author of a tell-all book about Trump titled 'A Warning,' according to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who told CNN on Friday that the search had become a 'vocation with everybody.'
McEntee, who lost his job in 2018 over concerns about his online gambling, has long expressed an interest in the personnel office despite having no previous government experience, two administration officials said. Within the West Wing, he is seen as fiercely devoted to the president and is well liked by first lady Melania Trump, the officials said.
Some within the White House have bristled at his lack of experience and aggressive approach to ferreting out 'Never Trumpers.'
McEntee 'does not have the relevant experience to do this job, unless the job is to purge Never Trumpers and reward loyalists,' one official said.
Another senior administration official countered that McEntee was talented and up to the task, with the key qualification of having the president's confidence.
As he gears up for the reelection contest, Trump has moved to surround himself with longtime allies who have proved their devotion to him while pushing away those who have not earned his trust.
This month, Trump rehired Hope Hicks, one of his longest-serving aides and closest confidants.
During a podcast interview last week, Trump concurred when Fox News analyst Geraldo Rivera described the White House as 'a nest of vipers and snitches and backstabbers and rats.'
'I inherited a place with, you know, many different administrations, and they worked there for years and were civil service and with unions and all of it,' he said on Rivera's 'Roadkill' podcast. 'You can't do what you'd like to do.'

Before pardon, Milken rebuilt legacy to focus on charity

Texto completo: For years, many of Washington's most influential leaders and Wall Street billionaires have descended on Beverly Hills for what some call the 'Davos of North America.' Last year, the room at the Milken Institute Global Conference where Ivanka Trump was speaking was packed, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was featured on a panel about the economy.
The annual gathering in California thrown by Michael Milken's namesake think tank " where a ticket can cost up to $50,000 " has been a highly visible part of the billionaire's efforts to build a new legacy after he spent nearly two years in prison for securities fraud in the early 1990s. Milken had gained national fame for pioneering the use of high-yield, high-risk securities in a way that made him among the most influential American financiers of the era.
Despite Milken's having originally been sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $600 million, he and his family held on to hundreds of millions of dollars in assets. With a net worth that Forbes estimates at $3.8 billion, he has showered more than $1 billion on medical research, education and other causes since the 1970s, according to his spokesman, Geoffrey Moore.
In 2014, George Washington University renamed its School of Public Health the Milken Institute School of Public Health. Milken's foundation has also handed out thousands of $25,000 checks to educators, in what's been described as 'the Oscars of Teaching.'
On Tuesday, President Trump pardoned the financier, along with pardoning or granting clemency to 10 other people, including former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Trump lauded Milken's philanthropic work before boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, saying Milken has 'gone around and done an incredible job for the world, with all of his research on cancer.'
The billionaire had just returned from South Africa, where he was hosting meetings on how to expand the availability of advanced medical therapies, and preparing to go into the office when the president called to tell him of the pardon, according to Moore. Milken then visited his 96-year-old mother, he said. 'She was very touched and so happy " she cried " that this pardon had come while she's still living,' the spokesman said.
In a statement, Milken, 73, said he and his wife were 'very grateful to the President. We look forward to many more years of pursuing our efforts in medical research, education and public health.'
Jordan Thomas, a partner at Labaton Sucharow and a former trial attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, said the pardon probably would be a 'troubling development' for the law enforcement officials who originally went after Milken. 'This is part of a long-term campaign to clean up the Milken family name and, apparently, it's been successful,' Thomas said.
Milken made a fortune helping corporations use junk bonds to finance corporate takeovers at the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert. Milken's innovations made him one of the most recognized figures in finance, and made it easier for both small entrepreneurs and corporate raiders to raise money, but they were also blamed by some economists at the time for encouraging U.S. businesses to get too heavily into debt.
His standing crumbled when he was charged as part of an insider-trading scheme. Milken initially denied the charges but ultimately pleaded guilty to six counts in 1990, sobbing as he admitted in court to manipulating financial markets. 'I realize that by my acts I have hurt those who are closest to me,' he said at the time.
Milken was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $600 million but was released after two years and quickly began his comeback campaign. 'The last six years have been very difficult, particularly, these last 22 months,' Milken said upon his release in 1993.
Milken's personal fortune remained about $125 million, and his wife and children were reported to have as much as $350 million, The Washington Post reported at the time.
Milken has no interest in returning to finance, said Moore, his spokesman.
'He will not give up on his lifetime crusade to find cures for cancer and other life-threatening diseases until those health threats are defeated. He works around the clock through multiple nonprofit organizations to address the world's greatest challenges in the fields of medical research, education and public health,' the spokesman said.
Milken was diagnosed with prostate cancer around the time of his release and started what is now known as the Prostate Cancer Foundation, funding various research studies on the disease. In 2004, Fortune magazine called him 'The Man Who Changed Medicine.'
'He has a lot of energy, I'll tell you, I'm impressed,' then-President Bill Clinton said of Milken in 1994 after calling into an event honoring the former financier for his work on prostate cancer. 'He makes me look like a piker. He makes me look like I'm on vacation every day, he has got so much energy.'
George Washington University renamed its public health school after the billionaire after the Milken Institute and the Milken Family Foundation donated a combined $50 million to the university in 1994, setting a record. GWU President Steven Knapp at the time called the gifts, which also included $30 million from businessman Sumner M. Redstone's charitable foundation, a 'pivotal moment.'
'Mike Milken's leading the effort in focusing the attention of the whole global community on chronic diseases,' Knapp said then.
But the Milken name wasn't always well-received. In 2011, Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, donated $10 million to the UCLA Law School, and the university announced the creation of the Lowell Milken Institute for Business Law and Policy. At least one professor, Lynn A. Stout, objected, saying it would damage her 'personal and professional reputation.'
Through his public policy think tank, Michael Milken's reach has extended into Washington. The Milken Institute occupies three buildings on Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House, including one opening in 2023, the Center for Advancing the American Dream, which will focus on education, public health and other issues. In January, the think tank released a plan for reforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the housing companies taken over during the global financial crisis.
Milken has not invested in either company, Moore said. 'Mike and his attorneys are very sensitive to any appearance of a conflict and make sure that he does not have a financial stake in any company or project that could create a conflict,' he said.
The Milken Institute has also been a leading proponent of 'opportunity zones' " a tax break tied to 2017 tax-cut legislation aimed at encouraging investment in distressed areas. The think tank hosted a panel on the tax break last year featuring a top Treasury Department official and Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R). According to the New York Times, the institute's leaders also pushed the Trump administration to make the tax break more generous for wealthy investors.
Milken has never purchased any property in an opportunity zone, said Moore. The Milken Institute called the New York Times report 'inaccurate.'
'I have no reason to doubt that Milken has spent the past 30 years doing good works and making the world a better place. He should be given enormous credit for that,' John K. Carroll, one of the lead prosecutors in Milken's case, wrote in a column for The Post. 'I have no dog in this fight, and I don't think that anyone should lose sleep over his pardon.'
But, Carroll wrote, that doesn't negate the fact that Milken committed financial crimes. 'I know that not only because we prosecutors saw the evidence but also because his attorneys, the best lawyers of his generation, counseled him to plead guilty,' Carroll wrote.
Milken's defenders have included Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was the U.S. attorney in Manhattan at the time that office led Milken's prosecution, and Nelson Peltz, who threw the president a $10 million fundraiser at his $95 million Palm Beach, Fla., house this month and recommended Milken be pardoned. Milken watched the results of the 2018 midterm elections at the White House, according to Bloomberg News.

Texto completo: As befits a book about astrology, Alexander Boxer's 'A Scheme of Heaven: The History of Astrology and the Search for Our Destiny in Data' starts with a horoscope: 'Today you find yourself presented with a mysterious opportunity. Take it, even if you're not sure it was really meant for you.'
In other words, suspend your skepticism about astrology long enough to hear what this author has to say in his sprightly, if occasionally heavy-going, defense of celestial divination.
Boxer is a data scientist with a PhD in physics, as well as degrees in the history of science and classics. When it comes to astrology, he is surprisingly open-minded, a rare stance for a scientist. In fact, he writes, astrology's status as pseudoscience 'makes it all the more delicious to think about.'

Astrology combines two powerful human tendencies: First, we are creatures of pattern-matching habit, seeking connections in everything. Second, we possess an irrepressible fascination with self. This combination leads us to find patterns among the stars, imbue these patterns with meaning and then apply this meaning to our own destinies.
Boxer sees in astrology 'an undeniable power . . . to reveal the surprising ways in which everything, and all of us, are connected to each other across time and space.' Point well taken. The notion of time and space is important because with each passing second the position of the stars changes in relation to us, and from the astrologer's perspective where our stars happen to be at any point in time will affect our individual fates.
For centuries, Boxer writes, the fields of astronomy and astrology were so tightly intertwined that neither could be fully untangled from the other. It was astrology, he points out, that became the ancient world's main motivation for improving the accuracy of planetary observations.
Yet over time the fields " and public and professional perceptions of them " diverged. How astrology came to be viewed as belonging in the realm of the superstitious and scientifically ignorant isn't clear, and Boxer doesn't address that change. Instead, he views the field of astrology through a thoroughly modern lens, that of today's omnipresent efforts to divine patterns in big data sets. His message is this: If you believe that big data can offer a useful window into the world, do so with the knowledge that others got there first, and very long ago. His implication is a call for humility. To believe anything else is hubris.
Astrology is composed of a few basic pieces: seven planets, 12 signs of the Zodiac and 12 houses of heaven. Together, however, these elements can be combined in an almost infinite number of ways. 'The chance that any one celestial configuration will occur is fantastically unlikely,' Boxer writes, 'and yet the heavens are graced by one of these fantastically unlikely configurations at every instant in time including right now.'
Enter the juxtaposition of our 21st-century thinking about big data, which seems new but was already the rage in the ancient world. Astrology, Boxer posits, was that era's 'most ambitious applied mathematics problem,' made especially intriguing because of the one basic feature that sets astrology apart: its intimate connection with the passage of time. Astrology's deep reliance on time 'allows it to mirror the ups and downs of our lives in an eerily convincing way.'
Various ancient objects point to humans' early interest in the movement of the sky. Stonehenge, which dates to around 3000 B.C., may have been built to align with sunrise on the summer solstice. The Egyptian pyramids are an early expression of the human regard for the stars. The oldest known personal horoscope, written in Babylon (near modern Baghdad), dates to 410 B.C., Boxer tells us.
One of Boxer's most intriguing examinations is of a piece of history that would have benefited from some astrological forecasting: the assassination of Julius Caesar. It is one of the few pivotal events in ancient history that can be precisely stamped with date, time and location: March 15, 44 B.C., at 12:55 p.m. at roughly the intersection of Via di Torre Argentina and Via dei Barbieri in the Rome of today.
In considering Caesar's death, Boxer gins up a beautifully rendered schematic " or 'scheme of heaven,' as he calls it " for that fateful blink of an eye. He shows that Venus, the ancestral goddess of the Julian clan, was almost completely obscured, as Jupiter sank mournfully below the western horizon. Bad omens both. But at the time, ancient Romans tended to rely more on signs contained in the flights of birds and the livers of sheep than celestial alignment.
By contrast, one scant generation of Roman emperors later, the importance of astrology had grown so quickly that Augustus had his Zodiac sign, Capricorn, stamped onto silver coins bearing his imperial image. Astrology became a crucial component of that empire's intelligence apparatus and would remain part of the public's consciousness for centuries to come.
Boxer's tone is lighthearted throughout, his writing lean and smart. Yet he doesn't shy away from complexity. As a matter of fact, he serves up plenty of it. The book's content grows increasingly matted with data analysis and algorithmic musings that could leave many readers behind. This reviewer, for example, got hopelessly lost in the thicket of Z-codes (Boxer's nickname for calculations used to determine an individual's astrological uniqueness) soon after the author introduced the concept on Page 141. This befuddlement occurred, for Z-code purposes, at 11:46 a.m. on Jan. 21, 2020, in the San Francisco neighborhood of Noe Valley.
But the intellectual heavy lifting shouldn't be a deterrent. There's enough in 'A Scheme of Heaven' to satisfy the curious layperson and the data geek alike. The chart of Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions vis-a-vis presidential peril alone is worth the price of this book. And with his lovely prose, Boxer makes it relatively easy to navigate " if not celestially then literarily " around the difficult bits. A journey through Boxer's own scheme of heaven is one well worth taking.

Texto completo: Journalist says India's prime minister is using Trump's visit to burnish his image
When President Trump travels to India on Monday, he will be received not as all past U.S. presidents have been, in New Delhi, but in the state of Gujarat, the birthplace of both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mohandas 'Mahatma' Gandhi, the father of modern India, who led the country to independence in 1947. The presidential party will be driven six miles to Sabarmati Ashram,-a retreat founded by Gandhi, which served as his home and the center of the freedom movement. Trump has excitedly told members of the press that 7-million people are expected to line the streets along the path of his motorcade. (The Indian press predicts a more modest turnout of about 50,000.) The motorcade will end at a cricket stadium where 100,000 people will welcome the president. Modi clearly understands Trump's love of large, cheering crowds and intends not to disappoint his friend.
It may seem like an odd choice for Modi, a politician nurtured by the RSS, an organization devoted to making India a Hindu nation; the RSS eventually birthed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Modi's ruling party. In other words, his intellectual predecessors fought everything that Gandhi and his protege, founding Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, stood for. The RSS despises the pluralistic India of Gandhi's vision and the Western-educated, liberal Nehru, who sought to protect minority rights and ensure that India became a secular country. But Modi's political genius has been to rewrite India's history, depicting his militant Hindu agenda as somehow under Gandhi's saintly halo, one still revered by the masses, while denying Nehru's contributions altogether. This is the vision of India he will be showing off to Trump this coming week.
Everywhere he goes, the U.S. president will be greeted by posters of Modi next to Gandhi. They never met " Gandhi was assassinated in 1948, two years before Modi was born " but from the way Modi uses Gandhi, you'd think the older man was his mentor. Modi's Clean India campaign, launched in 2014, adopted Gandhi's wire-rimmed glasses as its logo. On Oct. 2, the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth, Modi eulogized the Mahatma in a New York Times op-ed titled 'Why India and the World Need Gandhi.' He ordered every overseas Indian mission to commemorate the occasion.
Gandhi's great-grandson Tushar Gandhi has been understandably horrified by these developments; he said he was nauseated to see the BJP exploiting his great-grandfather's legacy while tolerating party members who work to rehabilitate the image of Gandhi's assassin, Nathuram Godse, a right-wing Hindu fanatic who belonged to the RSS.-Pragya Thakur, a BJP member of Parliament, keeps referring to Godse as a 'patriot'; Hindu nationalists have built statues of him, and a Hindu organization in Madhya Pradesh plans to build a temple in his honor.
Aside from being born in the same state and following a vegetarian diet, Gandhi and Modi have little in common. Modi and the BJP have in fact repudiated much that Gandhi stood for: nonviolence and tolerance. When Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, from 2001 to 2014 " admired as a successful, pro-business and uncorrupt politician " Hindu mobs under his watch in Godhra massacred nearly 2,000 Muslims over several days in 2002. In the aftermath, little was done to compensate the victims or assure them of their security. The incident attracted international condemnation and was investigated by the government and human rights organizations. There was enough suspicion about Modi's role that he was denied a U.S. visa until 2014, when he became prime minister.
By contrast, when the subcontinent was partitioned into India and Pakistan after independence in 1947, and riots broke out between Hindus and Muslims, Gandhi and Nehru zigzagged the country, going to affected communities to try to calm people and head off further ethnic violence. Gandhi, a Hindu, spent the night in the homes of Muslims as a symbol of his desire to protect their communities from further harm.
Modi seems to have little interest in actually following in Gandhi's footsteps. Violent attacks against Muslims by Hindu extremists shot up after Modi's election. He has done nothing to protect the rights of minorities, especially Muslims, and many for the first time feel unwelcome in their own country. In August 2019, he revoked the limited autonomy granted to Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, and later amended India's Citizenship Act to discriminate explicitly against Muslims.
The BJP under Modi now purveys a revisionist view of the Indian independence movement. Its members have criticized many of Nehru's foreign policy decisions, blaming him among other things for creating the Kashmir problem, mishandling the 1962 war with China and backing China's claim for a seat on the United Nations Security Council over India's. In the same way that Trump seems bent on undoing Barack Obama's signature achievements, Modi seems obsessed with Nehru. He recently invoked Nehru's name 23 times in a speech to Parliament while justifying the recent decisions, on Kashmir and the Citizenship Act, that inflamed the country. He likes to mock Nehru, sarcastically describing him as 'such a big secular person . . . such a great thinker, such a big visionary' who failed to protect Hindu minorities in neighboring countries after partition.
The RSS believes that Nehru's insistence on making India a secular democracy in the image of the West denied the country the full expression of its Hindu heritage. (Never mind that Nehru, believing that science could create a path out of poverty, established and funded the Indian Institutes of Technology and the medical schools that have spawned the engineers and doctors Modi loves to brag about.) Modi and the RSS believe that their fellow Gujarati Vallabhbhai Patel, a conservative who was the other potential candidate for prime minister at independence, should have been the one to lead India. As Gujarat's chief minister, Modi erected a colossal monument in Patel's honor. Ironically called the Statue of Unity, at 597 feet, it is the tallest statue in the world and will be a stop on Trump's tour.
Ever since he was elected prime minister, Modi has tried to sell a distorted narrative of the history of India and its founders, absconding with the reverence ordinary Indians feel toward Gandhi and delegitimizing their memories of Nehru. As Trump, his guest this coming week, has demonstrated, using the presidency to push 'alternative facts' can be a remarkably successful strategy.

Trump, claiming conversations are classified, wants to block Bolton's book

Texto completo: President Trump has directly weighed in on the White House review of a forthcoming book by his former national security adviser, telling his staff that he views John Bolton as 'a traitor,' that everything he uttered to the departed aide about national security is classified and that he will seek to block the book's publication, according to two people familiar with the conversations.
The president's private arguments stand in contrast to the point-by-point process used to classify and protect sensitive secrets and appears to differ from the White House's public posture toward Bolton's much-anticipated memoir. The National Security Council warned Bolton last month that his draft 'appears to contain significant amounts of classified information,' some of it top secret, but pledged to help him revise the manuscript and 'move forward as expeditiously as possible.'
'We will do our best to work with you to ensure your client's ability to tell his story in a manner that protects U.S. national security,' Ellen Knight, senior director of the council's records office, wrote in a Jan. 23 letter to Bolton's attorney.
But the president has insisted to aides that Bolton's account of his work in Trump's White House, 'The Room Where It Happened,' should not see the light of day before the November election, according to the two people familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations.
Trump has told his lawyers that Bolton should not be allowed to publish any of his interactions with him about national security because they are privileged and classified, these people said. He has also repeatedly brought up the book with his team, asking whether Bolton is going to be able to publish it, they said.
Trump told national television anchors on Feb. 4 during an off-the-record lunch that material in the book was 'highly classified,' according to notes from one participant in the luncheon. He then called him a 'traitor.'
'We're going to try and block the publication of the book,' Trump said, according to the notes. 'After I leave office, he can do this. But not in the White House.'
'I give the guy a break. I give him a job. And then he turns on me,' Trump added during the West Wing lunch. 'He's just making things up.'
Bolton's book has promised to unveil key first-person moments between Bolton and Trump that were at the heart of the president's handling of Ukraine, a saga that led to his impeachment by the House.
In a recent appearance at Vanderbilt University, former Obama national security adviser Susan E. Rice attacked Bolton for failing to testify in the impeachment hearings and said she 'couldn't imagine' withholding critical information from the American people to preserve it for a book. Bolton insisted his testimony would not have changed the Senate's impeachment acquittal.
As the Senate launched a trial in late January on the House's charges that Trump abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress, the New York Times reported it had learned a key detail alleged by Bolton in his manuscript: that Trump told him he was conditioning the release of military aid to Ukraine on whether its government would help investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.
Trump responded to that story on Jan. 27 by tweeting that he 'NEVER told John Bolton that aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into the Bidens or Democrats.'
Democrats demanded that Bolton be summoned to testify in the Senate trial, but Republicans rejected those calls.
A person close to Bolton said he has grown concerned in recent weeks that the White House has appeared to claim that broad categories of topics are classified, without clearly identifying or articulating the reasons for that level of protection. A separate person close to Bolton said the team anticipates the possibility of a long legal battle over the issue.
Bolton's lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, declined to comment Friday on the claim of classified material and the president's pledge to block the book's release.
'The NSC's pre-publication review of Ambassador Bolton's manuscript is proceeding,' Cooper said. 'Ambassador Bolton is continuing to pursue it in good faith. We have nothing to say beyond that.'
In many ways, Bolton remains a captive of the White House review process. He has earned a reported seven-figure advance for his account from publisher Simon - Schuster, which has planned to release the book on March 17.
But Bolton would take a huge legal risk " including the possibility of a criminal investigation " if he published his manuscript without the National Security Council's final approval.
There is precedent to give Bolton and his lawyers reason to pause. A former Navy SEAL wrote a 2012 book about his role in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, triggering a Justice Department criminal investigation into allegations he published classified details of his work and training as a special operator.
In a 2016 settlement, Matt Bissonnette, who wrote 'No Easy Day' under the pen name Mark Owen, agreed to turn over to the government all the profits and future royalties stemming from his book " which amounted to at least $6.6-million at the time. As part of the deal, Bissonnette acknowledged he failed to get his manuscript properly cleared by the Pentagon. In exchange, the Justice Department agreed to dismiss any other claims and drop any plans to prosecute him for the release of classified information.
Robert Luskin, the lawyer who represented Bissonnette after he came under investigation, said Bolton can challenge the White House review but it is unclear how he might fare.
'The challenge for Bolton is that the president has pretty broad power to classify or declassify; but once the manuscript has actually been submitted for review, Bolton would have the right to challenge undue delay or purely capricious or vindictive exercises of the government's authority to review and require changes,' Luskin said. 'He could get judicial review, but the process would not be fast and the rules not especially clear. '

Blaming a new ruling class " managers " for stoking populist resentment

Texto completo: Michael Lind's 'The New Class War: Saving Democracy From the Managerial Elite' seeks to put the populist eruptions that have consumed politics across the rich nations of the world into perspective and to deflate the panic that populists induce, by both treating them sympathetically and cutting them down to size.
Lind finds populism's roots neither in direct economic hardship nor in white nationalism but rather in resentment of the cultural, political and economic hierarchy that oppresses middle- and working-class people today. He claims that over the past half-century, a new ruling class " of 'managers' in global cities and other urban hubs, for whom 'degrees are the new titles of nobility and diplomas the new coats of arms' " has 'deprived much of the working class of effective voice or agency in government, the economy, and culture.' Once, Lind observes, 'trade unions, participatory political parties, and religious and civic organizations compelled university-educated managerial elites to share power with them or defer to their values.' But beginning in the 1970s, the managers 'unilaterally abrogated' this power-sharing settlement. Now, 'no longer restrained by working-class power,' the 'metropolitan overclass' has, as Lind puts it, 'run amok.'

Populism, Lind asserts, is a 'defensive reaction' that channels 'the legitimate grievances of many working-class voters.' Populist demagogues, in his view, are reactive rather than generative " a spark, not the fuel. They are also more pettily corrupt than grandly evil and weaker than commonly feared. President Trump, seen through this lens, is less a channel by which European fascism might come to the United States and more a familiar American type: a 'vulgar' urban political boss. 'Not Der Fuhrer,' Lind writes, but 'Da Mayor of America.'
Lind assembles many pieces of data " including reports of historical episodes, economic facts and statistics about current political opinion " to create his portrait of the class war. And he clearly sides with the beaten-down masses over the rising elite. He pairs hostility toward the hubris of the hyper-educated, cosmopolitan class with deep sympathy for the wounded dignity of ordinary citizens who are neglected by the economy, society and politics that this elite has built.
Readers who agree with Lind's perspective will find much ammunition here. Indeed, some of his claims are immediately compelling. The distinction (borrowed from Prospect magazine founder David Goodhart) between 'Somewheres,' whose lives and fates are linked to particular local communities, and 'Anywheres,' who derive income and status from globally transferrable skills, resonates powerfully with the felt experience of politics today. It also helps to explain Lind's view that citizens can embrace populist nationalism without being bigots.
Other claims, however, fall flat. For example, Lind's suggestion that foundation-supported 'community activists' are today's equivalent of 'nineteenth-century missionaries sent out to save the 'natives' from themselves' is rhetorical rather than reasoned. Lind offers no evidence that the activists are condescending or even outsiders, and he ignores the many ways in which activists seek to empower rather than to control the communities they serve.
A tendency toward bare assertion infects much of the book and some of its main themes. For instance, Lind's treatment of immigration badly lacks evidentiary support. He insists that large-scale immigration by unskilled workers powerfully depresses domestic wages and adds little to economic growth. He credits immigration's critics with a legitimate public concern for domestic equality and plays down ethno-nationalism and bigotry. He even calls suggestions that xenophobia plays a role in opposition to immigration an absurd medicalization of morality. Lind further proposes that those who protect immigrants act not from principle but from greed. He accuses corporations of seeking a compliant workforce and the rich of wanting cheap domestic help.
These claims are intensely contested. For example, an open letter signed by 1,470 economists, including six Nobel laureates, argues that 'the benefits that immigration brings to society far outweigh' its costs. A recent empirical study finds that each immigrant creates 1.2 jobs for local workers, so that 'overall, it appears that local workers benefit from the arrival of more immigrants.' And another study extends a similar result even to specifically illegal immigration, finding that deporting undocumented immigrants 'weakens' labor markets, 'increasing unemployment of native low skilled' workers, while legalization 'decreases the unemployment rate of low-skilled natives and it increases income per native.' Lind's treatment merely states one side of the issue. And his brief notes (focused on secondary sources rather than primary scholarship) give readers no assistance in reconstructing the debate for themselves.
The book's biggest problem cuts even deeper. 'The New Class War' lacks a theory of its own. Lind lays out facts but scarcely interprets their social meanings or identifies the causes that connect them. He does not explain why the mid-century power-sharing regime broke down just when it did or why managers in particular " people who run companies, cultural institutions or governments but do not own them " have taken over. He never explains why the managerial elite assumed economic, cultural and political power all at the same time, or how power in each sphere shores up power in the others. And he does not explain why the political reaction against these hierarchies takes on the peculiarly populist character " involving ethno-nationalism and hostility to institutions and the rule of law " that it has almost everywhere.
Other writers have provided deeper analyses. On the right, New York Times columnist David Brooks emphasizes the moral and psychological evils of individualism and private ambition, while American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray has lamented the decline of traditional virtues, including monogamy, industriousness and religious faith. On the left, the economist Thomas Piketty argues that capitalism inexorably concentrates wealth and enables rich owners to exploit poor workers, while Anthony Carnevale and Jeff Strohl of Georgetown University document the ways in which exclusive colleges enable rich families to pass privilege down from one generation to the next.
All these theories, of course, are debatable and even controversial. But each draws explicit lines of argument between effects and their ostensible causes, and between political movements and moral ideals to anchor perspectives on the current moment. Is religious faith really as essential to self-control as Murray supposes? Will capital overrun labor as Piketty describes? By revealing the deeper logics that drive their claims, these writers give readers the materials needed to make up their own minds.
Lind's book will surely resonate with those who are already persuaded, but it will do little to enlighten those who are not. This is a shame. Books like Lind's are being written and read because populism is as disorienting as it is disruptive. The political whirlwind makes it difficult to know what is happening, even as it only increases the desire to understand.
There is, after all, a great deal at stake.

Texto completo: Successful presidential candidates are mythmakers. They don't just tell a story. They tell a story that helps people make meaning out of the current moment; that divides people into heroes and villains; that names a central challenge and explains why they are the perfect person to meet it.
In 2016 Donald Trump told a successful myth: The coastal elites are greedy, stupid people who have mismanaged the country, undermined our values and changed the face of our society. This was not an original myth; it's been around since at least the populist revolts of the 1890s. But it's a powerful us vs. them worldview, which resonates with a lot of people.
Trump's followers don't merely believe that myth. They inhabit it. It shapes how they see the world, how they put people into this category or that category. Trump can get his facts wrong as long as he gets his myth right. He can commit a million scandals, but his followers don't see them as long as they stay embedded within that myth.
Bernie Sanders is also telling a successful myth: The corporate and Wall Street elites are rapacious monsters who hoard the nation's wealth and oppress working families. This is not an original myth, either. It's been around since the class-conflict agitators of 1848. It is also a very compelling us vs. them worldview that resonates with a lot of people.
When you're inside the Sanders myth, you see the world through the Bernie lens.
For example, if you look at Mike Bloomberg through a certain lens you see a successful entrepreneur who took his management skills into public service and then started giving his wealth away to reduce gun violence and climate change. If, on the other hand, you look at Bloomberg through the Bernie lens you see a rapacious billionaire who amassed a gross amount of wealth, who became an authoritarian mayor and targeted young black men and then tried to buy his way to power.
Same person through different lenses.
My takeaway from Wednesday's hellaciously entertaining Democratic debate is that Sanders is the only candidate telling a successful myth. Bloomberg, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar all make good arguments, but they haven't organized their worldview into a simple compelling myth. You may look at them, but you don't see the world through their eyes.
Elizabeth Warren inhabits a myth without expressing it clearly. It just happens to be Sanders' myth. I thought her performance Wednesday evening was tactically brilliant and strategically catastrophic. Her attack on Bloomberg was totally through the Bernie lens. Her attacks on Buttigieg and Klobuchar were also through the Bernie lens. (Through that lens a bigger spending proposal is always better than a less big spending proposal.)
Warren was a devastatingly effective surrogate for Sanders, but she reinforced his worldview rather than establishing one of her own.
Over the past five years Sanders and his fellow progressives have induced large parts of the Democratic Party to see through the Bernie lens. You can tell because every candidate on that stage has the categories and mental equipment to carve up a billionaire like Bloomberg. None have the categories or mental equipment to take down a socialist like Sanders.
Sanders goes untouched in these debates because the other candidates don't have a mythic platform from which to launch an attack. Saying his plans cost too much is a pathetic response to a successful myth.
I've spent much of this election season away from the campaign rallies and interviewing voters embedded in their normal lives. This week, for example, I was in Compton and Watts in and around Los Angeles. The reality I encounter every day has little to do with the us vs. them stories Trump and Sanders are telling.
Everywhere I go I see systems that are struggling - school systems, housing systems, family structures, neighborhoods trying to bridge diversity. These problems aren't caused by some group of intentionally evil people. They exist because living through a time of economic, technological, demographic and cultural transition is hard. Creating social trust across diversity is hard.
Everywhere I go I see a process that is the opposite of group vs. group war. It is gathering. It is people becoming extra active on the local level to repair the systems in their lives. I see a great yearning for solidarity, an eagerness to come together and make practical change.
These gathering efforts are hampered by rippers at the national level who stoke rage and fear and tell friend/enemy stories. These efforts are hampered by men like Sanders and Trump who have never worked within a party or subordinated themselves to a team - men who are one-trick ponies. All they do is stand on a podium and bellow.
In the gathering myth, the heroes have traits Trump and Sanders lack: open-mindedness, flexibility, listening skills, team-building skills and basic human warmth. In this saga, leaders are measured by their ability to expand relationships, not wall them off.
The gathering myth is an alternative myth - one that has the advantage of being true.

Texto completo: 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
All campaign long, Democratic candidates have fought hard to get on the debate stage.
Maybe Mike Bloomberg should have fought to stay off it.
Because instead of taking center (and centrist) stage, Bloomberg was upstaged by Elizabeth Warren's withering attacks on another "arrogant billionaire" in the race.
Despite decades in the public eye, including in the fishbowl of Gotham politics, New York's former mayor seemed unsteady and unready to respond to what had to have been a well-telegraphed attack.
Which just goes to show that while Bloomberg's billions can buy countless campaign commercials, in influential debates like the one Wednesday in Las Vegas, it's not ads, but ad-libbing that matters most.
Indeed, in a matchup that set all-time ratings records for a Democratic debate, Bloomberg didn't deftly deflect the attacks. So the mayor may have missed his chance to coalesce the centrist vote that's been bigger than the Elizabeth Warren-Bernie Sanders sum in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Instead, with most of the focus on Bloomberg, the night was a win for the relatively unscathed Sanders (let alone President Donald Trump, who was often left alone amid all the intraparty infighting).
Sure, the other mayor on stage, Pete Buttigieg, pressed Sanders on online aggression from the so-called Bernie bros. Others questioned what they seem to see as Bernie bromides on health care, college costs, student debt, the Green New Deal and other expenditures that cost Warren support once she priced them out.
But for the most part, the fire (and ire, in Buttigieg's and Amy Klobuchar's case) was aimed at candidates chasing Sanders, who was left to say (shout, really) what he means and mean what he says -- even if Bloomberg characterized Sanders' plans as "communism" (rhetoric the president would likely use, too, if Sanders becomes his general-election opponent).
So Sanders and Trump -- two polar, polarizing, opposites -- emerged as consensus winners. And the same consensus said that Bloomberg suffered a significant setback (unless even more campaign ads can erase debate memories).
But it wasn't a candidate, but the country, that had the biggest loss on Wednesday. Because the debate was too often about the race itself, instead of the race to save the country from concurrent crises.
One of these grand challenges, climate change, was even deemed "existential" by Joe Biden, the nearly forgotten former front-runner, who had his best moments in his best debate while talking about the issue.
But instead of these kinds of existential questions there were weird queries, like when Bloomberg was asked if he should "exist" (in reference to a riff from Sanders about billionaires).
While the climate change exchange at least has some substance, other essential -- if not existential -- issues weren't even explored.
For instance, none of the potential presidents was asked about nuclear proliferation, a threat so urgent that the "Doomsday Clock" was placed at 100 seconds to midnight -- the closest ever.
Wrote the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which officially sets the clock: "Humanity continues to face two simultaneous existential dangers -- nuclear war and climate change -- that are compounded by a threat multiplier, cyber-enabled information warfare, that undercuts society's ability to respond. The international security situation is dire, not just because these threats exist, but because world leaders have allowed the international political infrastructure for managing them to erode."
Seems that this is something that might concern the next president more than the arcane arguments that passed for debate on Wednesday. Like the Buttigieg-Klobuchar row about the Minnesota senator's not remembering the name of Mexico's president.
Maybe the name that should have arisen was Ingrid Escamilla, who was the subject of that day's New York Times story headlined "Grisly Murders Focus Mexico on Femicide." Escamilla, one of thousands of victims of Mexico's nihilistic violence, was stabbed, skinned and disemboweled in what was just the latest horror from the flailing, if not failing, state on America's southern border.
Or there could have been more debate about the borderless scourge of the coronavirus. The cascading cases raise questions about whether the world is ready for a global pandemic. And that could have led to a discussion about what's a bigger threat: A rising China or a receding one that's staggered by an economic contagion that, like a virus, knows no national boundaries?
Buttigieg, an Afghan war veteran, and Biden, a foreign-policy veteran of the Obama-era Afghan "surge" -- as well as every candidate -- could have been asked about an impending proposal that may trigger a troop withdrawal, but perhaps no lasting peace to the war-torn nation of Afghanistan.
And all should have gone on record about other controversial conflicts, including the abrogated Iran nuclear deal, as well as how they might lead a global response to the postwar record number of refugees, internally displaced people and economic migrants that will only swell with climate change disruptions. Some of the displaced have decamped to Europe, where the reception has been at times hopeful and at times hostile. Or even homicidal, as tragically demonstrated the day of the debate in Germany, where a racist extremist killed nine people in Hanau, home to many Turkish and Kurdish immigrants. The attack comes amid a rise in far-right movements convulsing the continent (if not the world).
Other security threats, from nation-states and nonstate actors like ISIS, could have also been brought up. As well as Russia, which again is attacking our election on behalf of Trump (and, reportedly, Sanders), according to intelligence officials who briefed House lawmakers last week. That meeting reportedly enraged the president, and may have cost the director of national intelligence his job. On the debate day, Trump tapped Richard Grenell, a loyalist with no national intelligence experience, to lead 17 spy agencies. This sharp departure on intelligence seems more relevant than Klobuchar asking Buttigieg if he thought she was "dumb."
Other critical issues, including campaign promises whose costs would explode the debt beyond its already unsustainable levels, were also generally unmentioned. And it's unlikely that they will be when the eventual nominee faces Trump in debates that promise to be even more about style over substance.
So starting in next week's Democratic debate in South Carolina, the moderators should give more than a modicum of attention to such worldly issues, and even invert the timing dynamic: Instead of tight time restrictions, candidates should have to expound on these existential issues for an extended time.
Such a format might be even more revealing than the response to the quick hits in Wednesday's heated, but not always enlightening, debate.

Texto completo: LARGO  Jack Pearcy will get the chance to tell a Pinellas-Pasco judge who killed 14-year-old Shelly Boggio in 1985.

James Daileys lawyers hope Pearcy will admit that he killed the girl  and not Dailey, the 73-year-old who has spent three decades on Floridas death row for the crime.

Circuit Judge Pat Siracusa on Thursday granted the defenses request to have Pearcy testify in an evidentiary hearing set to be held March 5 in a Pinellas County courtroom.

Daileys defense attorneys say it was Pearcy who stabbed, choked and drowned the girl, then left her body in the waters of the Intracoastal Waterway near the Walsingham Road Bridge in Indian Rocks Beach. They obtained a signed confession from the prison inmate in December.

Were very pleased with the decision today, and we think this is one more step toward justice for James Dailey, defense attorney Joshua Dubin said. We are confident that, in taking this one step at a time, the truth will come out.

Its hard to wrap your head around how long this man has been incarcerated, for more than three decades, for a crime he didnt commit.

Dailey and Pearcy were roommates when they were implicated in the murder and convicted in 1987. Pearcy told investigators that he saw Dailey stab the girl and drag her into the water and failed to stop him. He also said he may have held the knife and injured the girl. But he did not testify against Dailey.

Dailey received the death penalty. Pearcy was sentenced to life in prison.

The defense plans to depose Pearcy, who is now 64 and being held at Sumter Correctional Institution in Bushnell, before the March 5 hearing. Dubin said he thinks that Pearcy, who has exhausted his own appeals, will tell the truth and confess to the murder.

I expect him to testify and come clean about this, the attorney said.

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed Daileys death warrant in September. Dailey won a stay of execution, but that expired in December. The governor could set a new execution date any day now, but Dubin thinks hell wait.

Im confident that what the governor is doing is, hes allowing this process to play out in the courts, he said, which is the prudent thing to do given what has come out in this case.

Daileys defense has pointed to major flaws in the states case against him: The evidence is circumstantial and includes the testimony of three jailhouse informants who said they overheard him make incriminating remarks. One of them, Paul Skalnik, is a prolific jailhouse informant and serial con man whose reliability was questioned in an investigative report published in December by ProPublica and the New York Times Magazine.

As for Pearcy, his story has shifted since both men were sentenced. In 1993, Pearcy gave a sworn statement saying he had fabricated his story against Dailey at trial.

I was in custody and they were going to charge me, and I was just trying to get around it, thats all, he said. Lay the blame somewhere else.

Five years later, he wrote to Boggios twin sister that Dailey killed Shelly and apologized for failing to stop him. Ive beat my head on the wall because I was there & was so high on drugs and drinking that by the time I realized what was going on it was too late, he wrote.

Two inmates in different prisons both said Pearcy told them Dailey wasnt the killer.

Then in 2017, Pearcy signed an affidavit saying Dailey wasnt even at the scene of the murder. Instead, Pearcy said he was the only one responsible for Shelly Boggios death. But he backtracked when testifying.

In December, responding to an email from a Tampa Bay Times reporter, Pearcy wrote: Dailey killed Shelly by himself.

But before Daileys stay of execution expired Dec. 30, there came a new declaration from Pearcy: James Dailey had nothing to do with the murder of Shelly Boggio, it read. I committed the crime alone.

Altogether, the defense says Pearcy has confessed five times to the murder. He signed the latest one on Dec. 18, 2019: James Dailey had nothing to do with the murder of Shelly Boggio. I committed the crime alone. James Dailey was back at the house when I drove Shelly Boggio to the place where I ultimately killed her.

Siracusa can grant Dailey a new trial. Or the March 5 hearing could be the start of a series of evidentiary hearings where the defense would challenge other aspects of the case against Dailey  particularly Skalniks testimony and history.

Im hopeful that this is only going to be the tip of the iceberg in setting off a series of proceedings that we think will result in James Dailey getting a new trial at some point, Dubin said.

Shellys body was found May 6, 1985, in the waters beneath the Indian Rocks Beach bridge. A prosecutor later said she fought like an animal for her life.

She had been beaten, choked and stabbed 31 times. She had 18 defensive wounds. But the cause of death was drowning: She was held underwater until she died.

Texto completo: S uccessful presidential candidates are mythmakers. They don’t just tell a story. They tell a story that helps people make meaning out of the current moment; that divides people into heroes and villains; that names a central challenge and explains why they are the perfect person to meet it.
In 2016 Donald Trump told a successful myth: The coastal elites are greedy, stupid people who have mismanaged the country, undermined our values and changed the face of our society. This was not an original myth; it’s been around since at least the populist revolts of the 1890s. But it’s a powerful us vs. them worldview, which resonates with a lot of people.
Trump’s followers don’t merely believe that myth. It shapes how they see the world. Trump can get his facts wrong as long as he gets his myth right. He can commit a million scandals, but his followers don’t see them as long as they stay embedded within that myth.
Bernie Sanders is also telling a successful myth: The corporate and Wall Street elites are rapacious monsters who hoard the nation’s wealth and oppress working families. This is not an original myth, either. It’s been around since 1848. It is also a very compelling us vs. them worldview that resonates with a lot of people.
My takeaway from Wednesday’s hellaciously entertaining Democratic debate is that Sanders is the only candidate telling a successful myth.
Over the past five years Sanders and his fellow progressives have induced large parts of the Democratic Party to see through the Bernie lens. Sanders goes untouched in these debates because the other candidates don’t have a mythic platform from which to launch an attack. Saying his plans cost too much is a pathetic response to a successful myth.
I’ve spent much of this election season away from the campaign rallies and interviewing voters embedded in their normal lives. This week, for example, I was in Compton and Watts in and around Los Angeles. The reality I encounter has little to do with the us vs. them stories Trump and Sanders are telling.
Everywhere I go I see systems that are struggling — school systems, housing systems, family structures, neighborhoods trying to bridge diversity. These problems aren’t caused by some group of intentionally evil people. They exist because living through a time of economic, technological, demographic and cultural transition is hard. Creating social trust across diversity is hard.
Everywhere I go I see a process that is the opposite of group vs. group war. It is gathering. It is people becoming extra active on the local level to repair the systems in their lives. I see a great yearning for solidarity, an eagerness to come together and make practical change.
These efforts are hampered by men like Sanders and Trump who have never worked within a party or subordinated themselves to a team. All they do is stand on a podium and bellow.
In the gathering myth, the heroes have traits Trump and Sanders lack: open-mindedness, flexibility, listening skills, team-building skills and basic human warmth. In this saga, leaders are measured by their ability to expand relationships, not wall them off.
The gathering myth is an alternative myth — one that has the advantage of being true.

Texto completo: Richard Grenell moved quickly to review intelligence after President Trump appointed him as acting spy chief last week.
Grenell, a Trump loyalist who may only be acting director of national intelligence for a short time, requested the intelligence that went into a classified briefing to the House Intelligence Committee earlier this month, in which lawmakers were told the Kremlin was interfering in the 2020 election and that Russian President Vladimir Putin favors Trump's reelection, according to the New York Times.
The briefing, conducted by a top aide to former acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, reportedly upset Trump, who complained Democrats could use this information against him. Trump announced on Wednesday that Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, would replace Maguire. Some reports have said Trump was angry with Maguire, but his allies deny the removal had anything to do with the briefing.
Maguire resigned on Friday along with his deputy, Andrew Hallman.
In a couple of days' time, Grenell has requested access to information from intelligence agencies, such as the CIA. An official familiar with the matter told the Washington Examiner the request is completely straightforward and typical of a new director of national intelligence.
Democrats raised concerns about Grenell being a political appointee without sufficient background in intelligence, but Grenell said he won't be nominated to take on the spy chief role permanently. Trump must announce a nominee for Grenell to keep the role in an acting capacity past March 11, after which he would get at least six more months. Trump tweeted on Friday that four people are under consideration and would be making a decision in the coming weeks.
Grenell appointed Kash Patel, a National Security Council staffer who previously worked for the House Intelligence Committee's Devin Nunes, to be his senior adviser. According to a source who spoke with CBS News, Patel has a mandate to "clean house."

Texto completo: Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh accused "deep state" actors of using "every weapon" against President Trump ahead of this year's election.
Speaking on his show Friday, Limbaugh slammed a New York Times article published last week that said Russia is interfering in the 2020 contest. The longtime Republican castigated the national security apparatus for allowing leaks to subvert Trump's presidency.
"What they've tried with Trump here, this whole Russia meddling, Trump colluding, this whole thing is a gigantic lie, a totally bogus hoax, a silent coup," Limbaugh said. "Why should we believe about these people?"
"These are the people that told us there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq," he said, referring to the intelligence failure that led to the Iraq War. "I think there was as much resentment in the deep state, we just didn't call it that then, for George W. Bush as there is today for Donald Trump."
Trump awarded Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at this month's State of the Union address after the radio host revealed he had been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. Limbaugh was criticized weeks after receiving the award for suggesting Trump would easily defeat former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in a general election matchup because he is gay.

Boeing finds 'foreign object debris' in fuel tanks of undelivered 737 Max jets

Texto completo: An internal investigation into undelivered Boeing 737 Max jets found dozens of the aircraft with debris in their fuel tanks.
The findings are a troubling sign for Boeing, an aviation industry giant that has been rattled by scandal. In late December, Boeing fired CEO Dennis Muilenburg over his failure to address quality concerns in the Boeing 737 Max after two planes crashed and killed more than 346 people.
“This is unacceptable and won’t be tolerated on any Boeing aircraft when it’s delivered to the customer,” said a statement from Boeing released on Saturday.
Boeing found the debris in about 35 of its new 737 Max jets during maintenance on parked planes, the company said according to Reuters, and confirmed in a memo that the debris could be a potential safety risk. The Federal Aviation Administration said it knew Boeing was doing a voluntary inspection of the planes, but could not confirm specific numbers.
“We are taking steps to make sure we eliminate FOD (foreign object debris) from any and all aircraft," the statement added. More of the planes still need to be inspected.
President Trump grounded the planes in March of last year, and investigations into the planes revealed a November 2018 FAA report in which the agency said it expected the fleet to have one fatal crash every two to three years, a stark increase from other models.
In October 2019, documents given to the House Transportation Committee showed internal concern about the plane's anti-stalling system as early as 2015. Boeing employees claimed that pilots only had 10 seconds to react to a failure in the anti-stall system or face "catastrophic" consequences.
On Friday, the New York Times reported that federal prosecutors are investigating whether the company misled officials at the FAA during its process to approve the 737 jets.

'Never Bernie' movement failing miserably

Autor: Simonson, Joseph.

Texto completo: Though the 2016 Never Trump movement failed to stop the populist New York mogul from capturing the GOP nomination, it wasn't from lack of effort. Democrats now trying to block socialist Bernie Sanders's ascent have no comparable political infrastructure.
The Vermont senator is on the cusp of running up his delegate count to the point that a moderately center-left rival will find it difficult to catch up, including former Vice President Joe Biden, billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Even a populist left-wing rival like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is far down in the delegate count after the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.
Many are voicing concerns about the prospect of Sanders as the Democratic standard-bearer against Trump, fearing his calls for eliminating private health insurance and implementing a broader socialist agenda will sink the party's chances.
Still, there's no serious organized effort to stop Sanders. The furthest it has gotten is the likes of a Saturday New York Times column by moderately conservative writer Brett Stephens, "The Democrats Are in Trouble: The party’s riskiest bet is now its likeliest."
That stands in stark contrast to Republican anti-Trump efforts four years ago.
National Review, a preeminent conservative magazine, dedicated an entire issue to opposing the future president. Its editors called Trump "a menace to American conservatism who would take the work of generations and trample it underfoot in behalf of a populism as heedless and crude as the Donald himself."
In spring 2016, as Trump began steamrolling through the primaries, numerous donors and GOP operatives banded together to flood airwaves with advertisements attacking the party's front-runner. Former advisers to Trump rivals such as Jeb Bush and business leaders such as Paul Singer, Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, and Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts funded an anti-Trump PAC called "Our Principles."
Other conservative groups, such as American Future Fund and the Club for Growth, spent millions of dollars on anti-Trump ads.
On social media, "#NeverTrump" regularly trended on Twitter by conservatives vowing to never support Trump even if he secured the nomination. Lawmakers such as Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska said he'd support a third party if Trump earned the nomination.
None of that worked, of course. Trump handily earned the nomination after winning 44 voting contests, 30 more than Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who placed second. The majority of Republican voters who opposed Trump's candidacy in the primary ultimately held their nose and voted for him in the general election.
But as another outsider candidate, Sanders, sees his plurality of support deliver him wins in the Democratic primary, no opposition to him appears to exist outside of rival campaigns.
No magazine devoted to liberal, but not radical, thought such as the New Republic or the Atlantic appears ready to oppose his candidacy. Instead, popular liberal writers such as Jonathan Chait for New York magazine have floated concerns about Sanders's electability, but nothing about his ideology.
No former staffers for the presidential campaigns of candidates such as Sens. Kamala Harris or Cory Booker are coming out warning about the potential damage a socialist leader could do to the Democratic Party's reputation. Veteran Democratic strategists such as James Carville, who helped propel Bill Clinton into the White House on a relatively centrist platform, have sounded the alarm on Sanders's rise but appears to have few influential allies.
Wealthy donors who fund Democratic Super PACs such as For Our Future or Priorities USA don't appear ready to shift resources into a coherent "Never-Bernie" movement.
The paralysis is puzzling, consider Sanders has yet to break 30% of the vote in a primary. Even in Saturday's Nevada caucuses, where he's expected to handily earn the most delegates due to the state party's convoluted counting system, it's very unlikely he'll earn a majority of the vote.
Polling shows a large majority of Democrats say they're open to voting for a socialist, but 53% of the general public aren't. Just 28% of adults have a favorable opinion of socialism, while 58% hold negative views. The numbers are even lower for political independents, of which 23% hold a positive opinion of Sanders's ideology.
Exit polls from the New Hampshire primaries showed voters there didn't believe Sanders was the most electable candidate, with 28% saying Buttigieg has the best shot at beating Trump in November. Sanders tied for second with Klobuchar at 21%.
In contrast to the 2016 warnings from the pronounced warnings from Republican establishment figures that nominating Trump would hand Democratic rival Hillary Clinton an easy general election win, only Bloomberg has explicitly said Sanders would lose in the general election. Bloomberg, worth more than $50 billion from his financial information and news company, is also the only candidate to consistently articulate an ideological opposition to socialism.
Other candidates, such as Klobuchar, have suggested that nominating a socialist would be a liability, but only said she was "troubled" by the proposition.
On Thursday, Joe Biden's campaign co-chairman told the Washington Examiner that Sanders would lose to Trump, but the former vice president himself has refrained from using the same kind of language.
Concerns about Sanders's electability are shared by virtually every candidate running for president, including members of his own campaign. Despite the internal chatter, Sanders's rivals haven't unified in making it their central message against him.
Hypothetical general election matchups suggest some of those concerns may be overblown, with a RealClearPolitics average of polls showing Sanders leading Trump in a general election by 4.6 points.

Ex-ambassador disputes Biden story of getting arrested during South Africa visit

Texto completo: A former U.S. ambassador said he can't recall Joe Biden getting arrested during a visit to South Africa in the 1970s, which the vice president and presidential candidate has claimed in recent weeks.
Andrew Young, a former congressman and mayor of Atlanta who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations between 1977 and 1979 and extensively traveled with Biden, cast doubt on the story the former senator has been telling at campaign stops about the two of them being arrested on the streets of Johannesburg.
“No, I was never arrested and I don’t think he was, either,” Young told the New York Times. “Now, people were being arrested in Washington. I don’t think there was ever a situation where congressmen were arrested in South Africa.”
Biden, 77, did not mention the arrest in his 2007 memoir, which touched on his trips to South Africa in the '70s, and the New York Times couldn't find any reference to his arrest in the paper's archives.
“This day, 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid,” Biden told a crowd during a campaign event in South Carolina. “I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robbens Island.”
Biden, who has struggled in early Democratic primary contests, added more context to the story when he shared that Mandela had visited him in Washington and thanked the Delaware Democrat for getting "arrested trying to see me."
“After he got free and became president, he came to Washington and came to my office,” Biden said of Mandela at a brunch in Las Vegas this week. “He threw his arms around me and said, ‘I want to say thank you.’ I said, ‘What are you thanking me for, Mr. President?’ He said, ‘You tried to see me. You got arrested trying to see me.’”
The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to questions about his story of being arrested.

Texto completo: President Trump had a mixed week, raising some controversy with a series of pardons and commutations and his reaction to new reports of Russian election meddling, but gaining satisfaction in a series of positive polls that suggest many voters are looking past controversies.
In focus all week has been the 2020 election, and Trump traveled the country to give rallies before cheering crowds and talk up some of his achievements — for example, focusing on criminal justice reform. Meanwhile, Democrats bloodied each other in a debate battle ahead of Saturday’s Nevada caucuses that candidate Michael Bloomberg said Trump won.
Tweet
Democratic pollster John Zogby noted that Trump is at his high in approval polls, and conservative analyst Jed Babbin suggested that the 2020 Democrats are digging their hole deeper.
John Zogby
Grade C+
Lots going on this week. On the negative side for President Trump, Congress heard testimony that there is evidence that Russia is supporting his reelection campaign. His political consigliere Roger Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for obstruction of justice, and the president admitted that Stone would probably be exonerated before an expected pardon — further throwing shade at his own Justice Department and welcoming questions about a president who sees himself as either above the law or simply as the law.
On the positive side, the average of the last six polls shows Trump with a 47% approval rating, including another 49% by Gallup alone, 45% showing that they are satisfied with how things are going in the country, and 43% of independents approving of Trump's job performance. And then, there was the “Bloomberg Bungle,” the poor showing by Bloomberg as a presidential candidate in his first Democratic debate.
Jed Babbin
Grade C-
President Trump had a rocky week that saw him pardon or commute sentences of some worthy and unworthy types, a growing conflict with Attorney General William Barr, and the Democrats' revival of the totally bizarre theory that Russia is trying to help him get reelected.
Among the pardons and commutations Trump granted were for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, junk bond king Michael Millken, and former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik. Blagojevich, who had served eight years of a 14-year sentence for trying to sell former President Barack Obama’s Senate seat, instantly proclaimed himself a “Trump-ocrat.”
Tweet
Barr had said that Trump’s tweeting was making it impossible for him to do his job, but that didn’t stop Trump from attacking the Justice Department and the presiding judge in the Stone case. Trump can’t afford to lose Barr, so why is he ignoring Barr’s admonition? One attack on the DOJ and its lawyers follows another. Whoever is telling Trump to calm things down is being ignored.
The House Intelligence Committee reportedly was briefed by acting Director of National Intelligence Adm. Joe Maguire that Russia was trying to help get Trump reelected, and the committee promptly leaked the idea to the New York Times. Is the intelligence community so credulous as to really believe that? With socialist Bernie Sanders and liberal pushovers such as Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren running, it’s impossible to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin would prefer Trump to any of them. After the leak, Trump quickly replaced Maguire with his ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who is the most faithful Trump loyalist of all. But Grenell will not be in that position long, as the White House is searching for another loyalist to run the intelligence community. Trump’s relationship with the intelligence agencies is very sour and not getting better.
Meanwhile, the Democrats had another primary debate in which Trump won. It’s hard to see how the candidates are going to dig their way out of the hole they’ve dug for themselves. And they keep digging.

Vandals break windows at Mike Bloomberg’s Utah campaign office

Texto completo: Vandals broke the windows at the Salt Lake City campaign headquarters of Democratic presidential hopeful Mike Bloomberg early Saturday morning.
Six windows were broken and rocks were found inside the office at 243 E. 400 South, said Catherine Sant Marr, the communications director for Bloomberg’s campaign in Utah. The building is set back behind a small parking area, across the street from the City Library’s main branch.
The vandalism happened, Sant Marr said, sometime between 4:30 a.m. — the last time the office’s security company checked on the building — and 7 a.m., when the first staffer arrived for the day.
Salt Lake City police are investigating, Fox13 reported, but there was neither video nor witnesses.
Lauren Littlefield, Utah state director for the Bloomberg campaign, said in a statement that her staff was “disheartened” by the vandalism. “We know that emotions can run high in politics, but we also know that even when we disagree, Utahns and common ground in civil discourse.”
Littlefield continued that her staff is “laser focused on Super Tuesday” on March 3, when 14 states — including Utah — will hold presidential primaries.
Sant Marr said the vandalism didn’t slow down the work on the campaign. “We have an office full of volunteers, making calls,” she said.
The vandalism happened less than 48 hours after Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, held a campaign rally in Salt Lake City.
In the last two weeks, acts of vandalism were reported at Bloomberg offices in Toledo, Ohio; Youngstown, Ohio; Knoxville, Tenn.; Ann Arbor, Mich., and Flint, Mich. In those cases, words like “oligarch” and “corporate pig” were left on posters or in spray paint; the Salt Lake City vandals just broke windows, Sant Marr said.
On Friday, after the Knoxville incident, Bloomberg’s campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, issued a statement that implicated, without evidence, supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
“We don’t know who is responsible for this vandalism, but we do know it echoes language from the Sanders campaign and its supporters,” Sheekey said, urging Sanders "to immediately condemn these attacks and for his campaign to end the Trump-like rhetoric that is clearly encouraging his supporters to engage in behavior that has no place in our politics.”
The Sanders campaign declined to comment about Sheekey’s accusations when asked by reporters for The New York Times and NBC News.

Stephens: Beijing’s great leap backward

Texto completo: Several years ago, in an overheated room in Beijing, I was forced to endure a stern lecture from a Chinese foreign ministry official. My sin: As the editor at the Wall Street Journal responsible for the paper’s overseas opinion sections, I had apparently insulted the entire Chinese people by publishing the work of a “well-known terrorist” — courageous Uighur human-rights activist Rebiya Kadeer.
I had to clench my jaw to suppress the rejoinder that China’s best-known tyrant, Mao Zedong, has his portrait overlooking the killing field known as Tiananmen Square.
I thought of that episode this week on hearing Wednesday’s news that the Chinese government has decided to expel three Wall Street Journal reporters based in China — two Americans and an Australian — in retaliation for the headline of an opinion column by Walter Russell Mead, “China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia.” In a style reminiscent of my own experience, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement claiming, “The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and smear China with malicious attacks.”
Any reader of Mead’s column, headline and text alike, will note that there isn’t an iota of racism in it, though it makes a devastating case about the ways in which the coronavirus epidemic has exposed the broader fragility of the Chinese system. And those familiar with the Wall Street Journal will know that the paper, like the New York Times, enforces a strict separation between its news and opinion sections — meaning the reporters facing expulsion had absolutely nothing to do with the writing and publication of Mead’s column.
But factual accuracy is irrelevant in a political scapegoating exercise, which is what this strike on the Journal is all about. And this does more to underscore Mead’s broader point about China’s inherent weaknesses than it does to contradict it.
What are those weaknesses? Demographers point to China’s falling birthrate, aging population and gender gap. Economists cite its faltering productivity, its made-up statistics and its giant debt bomb. And political analysts point to ever more repressive policies from Beijing, leading to ever greater discontent from Hong Kong to Xinjiang.
But the coronavirus crisis has exposed a far-deeper weakness: The Chinese regime fears information.
It was just this fear that, as my New York Times colleague Nick Kristof pointed out, led the government to suppress news about the new virus — and punish whistleblowing doctors — when it should have done the opposite, swiftly, so as to better contain its spread. The result was the loss of critical time in fighting the virus, all but guaranteeing the global health crisis that followed.
This sort of behavior is nothing new for the Chinese government: It mishandled the 2003 SARS epidemic in much the same way. Nor is the problem specific to China: Any regime that depends on the manipulation or manufacture of “truth” for its own survival is bound to act in similar ways. That’s one of the reasons Donald Trump’s nonstop lying and misstatements of fact aren’t just immoral but also dangerous. Truth driven underground doesn’t vanish. It stalks.
But the problem for the Chinese is much more acute, for the simple reason that they don’t have genuinely independent domestic journalism. That means that ordinary people have no access to timely, accurate and comprehensive information — and neither do China’s rulers. The result is rumor, which can be dangerous; ignorance, which can be fatal; and miscalculation, which can be catastrophic.
The move against the Wall Street Journal will compound the regime’s problems, since reporting by foreign news organizations has often been critical in filling the omissions and straightening the distortions of China’s official media. It was the Journal that did some of the most pathbreaking work to expose the scale of the country’s environmental catastrophes, just as it was the New York Times that exposed the extent of graft at the top of the Chinese leadership pyramid. Other news outlets, particularly Reuters, have done vital reporting on the frauds and scams endemic in China’s economy.
Suppress this kind of reporting, and the first people who will suffer information blindness are China’s leaders. Every dictator needs subscriptions to the Journal and the Times, even if they come — like smutty magazines of yore — in inconspicuous brown envelopes.
It’s always possible that the regime will think better of its move to expel the reporters or at least quietly let them return in a few weeks’ time. Wise leaders, facing a monumental crisis brought on by their own irrational distrust of information, would at least learn the lessons of their folly. But there might be a truth in China even more frightening than the coronavirus — foolish rulers.
For that, no vaccine has ever been invented.

Texto completo: Stupid crime really doesn't pay (thumbs down)
In the annals of Stupid Human Crimes, two incidents from the past week are surely vying for induction into the local category. Our hands-down nominee is Fhontez Mitchell. Here's a guy who threw his entire life away and allegedly shot a St. Louis County police officer -- all for the cause of shoplifting a pair of women's pajama pants. Mitchell, of Ferguson, now faces felony charges of first-degree robbery, first-degree assault, tampering with evidence, resisting arrest and two counts of armed criminal action. His bond is set at $1 million.
And did we mention that this was all for a pair women's pajama pants?
An off-duty officer was working last Sunday as a security officer at a Ferguson Walmart when he tried to stop a shoplifting suspect. The suspect opened fire with a semi-automatic gun, hitting the officer twice in the torso and once in the arm. A protective vest blocked the torso shots. He is recovering. But Mitchell's problems have only just begun.
Second on our list is an unidentified woman who was caught on security video stealing 142 Lego figures from a Chesterfield store. The thefts occurred not once but on two separate days at a Barnes & Noble store in Chesterfield. The items were valued at $560.
Speculation is that the figures might include Harry Potter, a guy jumping out of a cake or a man dressed as a cactus. "Now we're not sure yet what her intentions are with the 142 Lego mini-figurines. But we do know it probably wouldn't be a good idea to walk around barefoot inside her residence," a cryptic police online posting said. Definitely avoid Cactus Man.
Cleanup on aisle five (thumbs up)
Customers in an Indiana Kroger's recently found themselves sharing the aisles with a deer that strolled in the front door and proceeded to prance through the store. "I saw a huge deer run frantically toward me, at first I thought it was a German Shepard, so I pushed my kids out of the way but soon realized it was a deer," witness Brigette Dan told CNN via an online message.
Video of the animal shows it sliding on the floor and jumping over the meat counter. In a Facebook post, Dan said the animal appeared to have gotten a bloody nose during its indoor run, before making its way back outside.
A Kroger spokesperson wryly told CNN: "I hope, in her time near the meat case, the deer noticed our expanded selection of plant-based protein products."
Environmental Abe? (thumbs up)
Abraham Lincoln has already secured his place in history for ending slavery. Was he also America's first environmentalist president? That's the intriguing claim of scholar James Tackach, author of "Lincoln and the Natural Environment."
Even as Lincoln fought to reunify a nation torn by the Civil War, he signed into law numerous environmentally targeted measures, including America's first-ever designation of public-use lands. The Yosemite Grant Act of 1864 declared tens of thousands of acres of California wilderness protected areas that belonged to the public and couldn't be developed. It laid the groundwork for Theodore Roosevelt's massive expansion of America's national parks decades later.
Lincoln had always loved nature, and some scholars believe the Civil War's immense environmental destruction touched that nerve. Tackach tells the story of Lincoln admiring a lone oak tree that survived the battle of Petersburg, Virginia. "I believe it was during the Civil War, when he realized the damage being done to the environment, that he became a greener president," said Tackach. "He knew the country was going to have to heal environmentally."
Buzzkill (thumbs down)
In the latest warning beacon about global warming, the fat, furry, noble bumblebee is disappearing. That's the conclusion of a new report published last week in the journal Science. The report found that bumblebees have declined by 17% in Europe (as compared to the period between 1901 and 1974) and an astounding 46% in North America. The worst declines were in regions that suffered the worst temperature spikes.
"The scale of this decline is really worrying," biologist Peter Soroye, the study's lead author, told The New York Times. "This group of organisms is such a critical pollinator in wild landscapes and agricultural regions."
Due to their large size and fuzziness, bumblebees are among nature's best pollinators; simply put, those fur-like strands all over their bodies trap and transport more pollen from plant to plant than other bees. Bumblebees are especially important in pollinating tomatoes, peppers and other food plants. Since we need food, we need bees.
Corona-conspiracy (thumbs down)
Bonkers conspiracy theories are a sad fact of modern life, but Sen. Tom Cotton should know better than to spread the thoroughly debunked myth that the current coronavirus outbreak was engineered by Chinese scientists.
On a Fox News interview, the Arkansas Republican referenced a laboratory in Wuhan, China, epicenter of the epidemic, saying it is near "China's only biosafety level 4 super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases." He stressed the need to get to the bottom of whether "this disease originated there" in the laboratory.
To the casual viewer it might have sounded like a reasonable question, but -- as a sitting senator should know -- it's one that has already been asked and answered repeatedly.
As one scientist reiterated to The Washington Post: "There's absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered. The possibility this was a deliberately released bioweapon can be firmly excluded." Deliberately fomenting political paranoia amid a real health scare is beyond irresponsible.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman Democratic congresswoman from New York City known simply as AOC, is endorsing Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in Texas.
Tzintzún Ramirez, an Austin-based labor and voting rights activist, is the only U.S. Senate candidate endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez among the seven progressive female candidates nationwide who’ve won the backing of the New Yorker’s political action committee, Courage to Change.
“It’s important for us to create mechanisms of support because so much of what is happening in Washington is driven by fear of loss,” Ocasio-Cortez told The New York Times, which first reported the endorsement Friday. “We can really create an ecosystem that makes people more comfortable into making the leap to make politically courageous choices.”
“I am proud to receive the endorsement of congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s people-funded Courage to Change PAC,” Tzintzún Ramirez said in a statement. “I have spent my career fighting against corporations with powerful lobbyists by mobilizing working people, and I believe in the power of us to create change.”
“When I am in the Senate, I will fight for the bold, progressive change that Texans deserve, including securing an economy with living wages, high-quality health care for all, and real action on climate change,” Tzintzún Ramirez said.
One of Tzintzún Ramirez’s Democratic rivals, Sema Hernandez, tweeted her reaction to the endorsement: “I’m just finding out that @AOC is endorsing the union busting, racist, Super PAC and billionaire funded @cristinafortx. This is the second time AOC has done this, first Beto now Cristina.”
Hernandez finished second to Beto O’Rourke in the 2018 Democratic Senate primary, winning close to a quarter of the vote. Like Ocasio-Cortez, Hernandez backs Vermont’s Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Tzintzún Ramirez has said she likes both Sanders and Massachusetts’ Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Also among the candidates to get the blessing of Courage for Change is Jessica Cisneros, who is seeking to defeat U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, in the March 3 Democratic primary. Ocasio-Cortez had already publicly backed Cisneros.
The endorsement is a big one for Tzintzún Ramirez, who in the University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll released Monday was running second to Air Force veteran MJ Hegar in a crowded 12-person field. Hegar is at 22% and Tzintzún Ramirez at 9%. If, as seems almost certain, no candidate wins a majority in the primary, the top two candidates would compete in a May 26 runoff.
On the Republican side, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, faces four little-known opponents.
Even before the endorsement, Cornyn had nicknamed Tzintzún Ramirez, “AOCristina.” Cornyn campaign manager John Jackson issued a statement Friday saying that, “AOC’s endorsement of AOCristina proves that radical liberals are coming for Texas with all they’ve got. Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez's policies are out of step with Texas voters and we look forward to educating Texans on her disastrous Green New Deal, Medicare-for-None, and gun seizure program this fall.”
Earlier this week, U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, endorsed Tzintzún Ramirez.

Texto completo: Conde Nast, the publishing giant behind Vogue, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, said Friday that it would no longer use nondisclosure agreements for matters involving harassment and discrimination.
Stan Duncan, the company's chief people officer, laid out Conde Nast's new stance in a memo to employees that was shared with The New York Times.
"There are legitimate arguments in favor of NDAs in certain circumstances, which is why their use remains widespread - confidential settlements can spare both employees and employers the cost of litigation, and maintain privacy for all involved," Duncan wrote. "However, given our company's values and commitment to transparency, we have decided that going forward, we will no longer enter into NDAs that prevent an employee from making a disclosure of conduct they were subjected to that they believe, in good faith, constitutes harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. We also expect to release existing NDAs in these matters."
The executive added that the company would release people from existing nondisclosure agreements related to those matters on a case-by-case basis.
The use of nondisclosure agreements across many companies for complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination has become a flash point in the wake of the #MeToo movement. The New Yorker has been at the forefront of the discussion: The magazine won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for Ronan Farrow's investigation into decades of allegations of sexual misconduct by film producer Harvey Weinstein, which involved the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence his accusers.
Weinstein is currently on trial, accused of rape, in New York.
The News Guild of New York, which represents employees at the Conde Nast publications The New Yorker, Pitchfork and Ars Technica, said in a statement Friday that its members applauded the announcement.
"NDAs represent a harmful practice that prevents journalists from holding accountable those who abuse their power - eroding a fundamental principle of journalism," the statement said.

Founder of the Hair Club for Men (and also a client)

Texto completo: Sy Sperling, 78, a businessman who helped bring the hair-loss industry into the mainstream with ubiquitous, self-effacing ads, died Wednesday at a hospital in Boca Raton, Florida.
His death was confirmed by his publicist, Terri Lynn, who said it followed a lengthy illness but did not specify the cause.
Sperling achieved a kind of cult fame in the 1980s, as a late-night commercial for his business, then called the Hair Club for Men, started playing on televisions around the country.
The son of a plumber from the South Bronx, New York, he had no training as an actor and merely stood in a bland room, reciting memorized lines to the camera. But he added a winning kicker.
"Remember," he said, about to hold up an old photo of his own bald pate. "I'm not only the Hair Club president, but I'm also a client."
Calls started pouring in from men interested in his hair-restoration salons, which offered various "weaving systems." Sperling quickly became the face of male hair loss - however much sat on his head - and helped pave the way for a booming industry in male health and cosmetics.
Often called the Infomercial King of late-night TV, he appeared in bits on "The Tonight Show" and "Saturday Night Live," stepped into the ring at WrestleMania and made the rounds on TV talk shows and radio for years.
"Even to this day people stop me in the street," he told The Wall Street Journal nearly 30 years after the ad first ran. "People perceive me as the guy next door. My speech is imperfect. My whole TV success had to do with the fact that it was believable and that I was able to afford good TV time by going on late at night."
Seymour Sperling was born in the Bronx, and his father, David, was a plumber, and his mother, Carrie, was a bookkeeper.
He served in the Air Force while attending college before finding work in sales and home improvement. He started his business out of personal need: He had lost most of his hair by the time he was 25, leaving him feeling insecure.
"I was really unhappy with my appearance," he told The New York Times in 1993. "And it was destroying my self-confidence."
With a hair weave, he told the Journal, he felt he could sleep, style his hair and go out on dates without confronting the question that comes with wearing a toupee: "How do you explain, I got to take my hair off now?"
So with about $5,000 and their credit cards, Sperling and his girlfriend at the time - a hairdresser - bought a defunct salon in Manhattan. There, they developed a hair-replacement system that used a very fine nylon mesh, adhesives and hair colored to match the customer's.
He told the Times that he wanted to remove some of the stigma around baldness.
"For years, men have felt funny even discussing it, much less trying to do something about it," he said. "I think what I've done is remove some of the embarrassment associated with men wanting to improve their looks."
The commercial that made his career first aired in 1982. It was inspired by titans of industry like Frank Perdue of Perdue Chicken and Victor Kiam of Remington Products, who started appearing in their own ads.
"I said, 'If they could do it with chickens and electric shavers, I'll do one for hair,' " Sperling said in a 2007 documentary, "Roots: The Hair-Raising Story of a Guy Named Sy."
In 2000, Sperling sold his company to a private equity firm for $45 million, and it was eventually acquired by the Japanese company Aderans, which offers hair-loss treatments.
For the next 20 years, he lived in what he called semiretirement, hosting a radio show, giving speeches and helping run a charity, the Hair Club for Kids, which gives hair to children who have lost their own because of chemotherapy, alopecia or other conditions.
In those public events, he never appeared with anything less than a full head of hair - though he acknowledged that male baldness was no longer considered the blemish it used to be.
But Sperling held firm to the end, his publicist said: "He always remained a Hair Club client."

How food trucks went from 'roach coaches' to trendy

Texto completo: It's been 12 years since Kogi food truck pulled up outside of the UCLA dorms in California during finals week, hawking tender Korean short rib tacos for $2 to frazzled students.
At the end of its first year in business, Kogi had made an impressive $2 million in sales, sparking what is widely thought of as the beginning of the modern age of food trucks.
Of course, lunch carts, ice cream trucks and street vendors have existed for decades, but Kogi ushered in a new era on a national level — cheap, creative quick-service food that's actually cooked in a kitchen inside of a truck.
On the East Coast, Rutgers University's grease trucks, known for layering oily foods in between two pieces of bread to create "Fat Sandwiches," put food trucks on the map.
Trucks such as the famous "RU Hungry?" lined College Avenue at the New Brunswick campus and sold their calorific offerings.
According to the New York Times, these trucks were given designated parking spots in the 1980s, predating even the Kogi craze. In 2004, Maxim Magazine named "RU Hungry?'s" Fat Darrell sandwich the best in the nation. In 2005, Sports Illustrated On Campus called dining at the grease trucks the best postgame activity in the U.S. The trucks were removed by the college in 2013, but their legacy lives on.
Today, the laws regulating food trucks vary from town to town in New Jersey and are vastly different from those in other states.
According to the 2017 Food Truck Nation report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, food trucks in Philadelphia are subject to strict health inspections before every big event they attend, approvals are needed to vend in high-foot-traffic areas, vending is prohibited after midnight and food trucks cannot park closer than 30 feet from another truck while street vending.
In New York City there's a limit on the number of food trucks allowed, so many owners wind up spending upwards of $25,000 on the black market to get a permit, says the report, or else sit on a permit waiting list for up to 15 years. Parking restrictions block them from operating in many busy areas and all food truck employees are required to take a class to obtain a food handler's license.
No New Jersey city was studied in the report. But to compare, Hoboken grants a limited number of permits a year for street vending. Food trucks can only vend in approved parking spaces. The application fee for a business license is $500 and annual parking permits cost $1,600 to vend for four days and $2,500 for seven days. All food trucks must have a GPS tracking system, as well, so law enforcement can be sure they're following the rules.

Texto completo: We should talk about minute 24.
It's the moment on "The Daily," the New York Times podcast, when reporter Megan Twohey asks Harvey Weinstein's lead defense attorney, Donna Rotunno, if she's ever been sexually assaulted.
"I have not," Rotunno answers. "I have not. Because I would never put myself in that position."
Twohey, co-author of "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement," which chronicles the Weinstein story from start to publication, pauses.
"So you're saying - actually, I'm sorry," Twohey says after a beat. "So you're saying that you have never been sexually assaulted because you would never put yourself in the position of being sexually assaulted?"
"No," Rotunno answers. "I've always made choices, from college-age on, where I never drank too much, I never went home with someone that I didn't know, I just never put myself in any vulnerable circumstance. Ever."
Rotunno has a role to play, and she's not going to go off-script during an interview with the reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize for the reporting that took down her client. Rotunno's job is to cast doubt on Weinstein's accusers. Her answer attempts to do just that.
But it also propels an ugly myth about assault that we need to push back on when it rears its ugly head.
Rape is not caused by poor choices. Rape is caused by rapists.
You can try to minimize your risks of being raped, just as you can try to minimize your risks of becoming the victim of any number of violent crimes. But that's not always enough. And if it has, for you, been enough, you are also the beneficiary of some very good luck.
Good luck to have been born into a home in which no one preyed upon you. Far, far too many children aren't so lucky.
Good luck to have never crossed paths with a predatory coach or mentor or youth group leader or priest or classmate or instructor or medical practitioner or boss.
Good luck to have not been the victim of spousal rape.
Good luck to have never been abducted.
Good luck to have gone through life, so far, without someone using their power - power in the form of a weapon, power in the form of physical size, power in the form of authority - to rob you of your bodily agency.
I wish every woman and man, girl and boy had such luck. They don't.
Maybe Rotunno subscribes to the just-world fallacy - the belief that we live in a morally fair society, and people who encounter misfortune likely had some hand in causing that fate. That's certainly easier than accepting that terrible things sometimes just happen. Unprovoked. Unjustly.
Or maybe she answered in the way that felt, to her, as honest as possible while still being as strategic as possible.
Regardless, her answer was toxic.
Because it adds to the already far too prevalent messages that assault survivors are slapped in the face with repeatedly: that they could have prevented their assault, that they had some hand in causing their assault, that they should have known better than to become a victim of assault.
It contributes to a culture of doubt and denial and blame that victims have to navigate when deciding whether to come forward with their stories - stories that, if they are heard and heeded, can save more people from being victimized. How many athletes may have been spared Larry Nassar's reign of terror if coaches and parents and college administrators acted as soon as the gymnasts in his care started speaking up?
And it slows us down from learning what we really need to grasp and understand about sexual assault: that it is, above all, an abhorrent abuse of power. It is a stripping away of another person's autonomy. It is a debasing of that person's humanity. It says, "I matter. You don't."
No one puts themselves in that position. To surrender their autonomy and humanity. To not matter.
Rotunno is doing her job. Maybe it will work in court; maybe it won't.
But when her words float into the national dialogue as they did on that podcast, the rest of us get to make our own judgment. The rest of us get to reject that (il)logic.
The rest of us get to overrule that kind of toxic messaging and make sure it doesn't find a safe place to land and grow and spread.

Texto completo: Conde Nast, the publishing giant behind Vogue, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, said Friday that it would no longer use nondisclosure agreements for matters involving harassment and discrimination.
Stan Duncan, the company's chief people officer, laid out Conde Nast's new stance in a memo to employees that was shared with The New York Times.
"There are legitimate arguments in favor of NDAs in certain circumstances, which is why their use remains widespread - confidential settlements can spare both employees and employers the cost of litigation, and maintain privacy for all involved," Duncan wrote. "However, given our company's values and commitment to transparency, we have decided that going forward, we will no longer enter into NDAs that prevent an employee from making a disclosure of conduct they were subjected to that they believe, in good faith, constitutes harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. We also expect to release existing NDAs in these matters."
The executive added that the company would release people from existing nondisclosure agreements related to those matters on a case-by-case basis.
The use of nondisclosure agreements across many companies for complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination has become a flash point in the wake of the #MeToo movement. The New Yorker has been at the forefront of the discussion: The magazine won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for Ronan Farrow's investigation into decades of allegations of sexual misconduct by film producer Harvey Weinstein, which involved the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence his accusers.
Weinstein is currently on trial, accused of rape, in New York.
The News Guild of New York, which represents employees at the Conde Nast publications The New Yorker, Pitchfork and Ars Technica, said in a statement Friday that its members applauded the announcement.
"NDAs represent a harmful practice that prevents journalists from holding accountable those who abuse their power - eroding a fundamental principle of journalism," the statement said.

Pull yourself up by the bootstraps? Go ahead, try it OP-ED

Texto completo: Back in the 1800s, the expression "pull oneself up by the bootstraps" meant the opposite of what it does now. Then it was used mockingly to describe an impossible act.
An 1834 publication ridiculed a claim to have built a perpetual-motion machine by saying that the inventor might next heave himself over a river "by the straps of his boots." An 1840 citation scoffs that something is "as gross an absurdity as he who attempts to raise himself over a fence by the straps of his boots."
Yet this phrase has become part of America's mythology and the centerpiece of our approach to help those left behind: We harangue them to lift themselves up by the bootstraps. When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this month dismissed bootstrapping at a congressional hearing as "physically impossible," outrage reverberated across the conservative media world.
Sean Hannity's blog said that her assertion "left millions of television viewers scratching their heads." Another Fox News commentator said that Ocasio-Cortez was "completely clueless."
So let's think this through.
It's true that upward mobility has always resonated deeply in the United States. My father, a refugee from Romania and Ukraine, came to the United States because to him it symbolized opportunity (and, sure enough, it provided him rich opportunities).
Some people do manage heroic journeys to the top. Ben Carson grew up as an impoverished black child of a single mother in Detroit and became a pediatric neurosurgeon and secretary of housing and urban development. Bravo to him.
The problem is that this bootstraps narrative drives out good policy in three ways.
First, it suggests that historically Americans rose purely through rugged individualism - think of the pioneers!
Ah, but why did the pioneers go west? Because of government benefit programs that granted them homesteads! Ten percent of America's land was given out as homesteads, and perhaps one-quarter of Americans (almost all of them white) owe part of their family wealth to the homestead acts.
Then there was the American investment in free high schools and in state colleges and universities, plus gigantic programs like rural electrification and the GI Bill of Rights. In short, even when we were a much poorer nation, we were able to afford huge national investments to help disadvantaged (white) Americans, because they were a priority.
Second, the bootstraps narrative often suggests that benefits programs are counterproductive because they foster "dependency." That may have been a plausible argument a generation ago, but the evidence now indicates that it is incorrect.
Europe and Canada have much more robust social welfare systems than the United States, but Americans in the prime working years (ages 25 to 54) are more likely to drop out of the labor force than Europeans and Canadians in those years. Americans drop out of the labor force primarily because we do worse than other countries of investing in workers' education, health care, addiction treatment and job training.
Third, the bootstraps narrative implies that everyone can pull a Ben Carson (Carson himself falls for this fallacy). This is like arguing that because some people can run a four-minute mile, everyone can.
Yes, some Americans soar from humble beginnings; more often, the top is occupied by those who, say, were earning $200,000 a year at age 3, in today's money, as President Donald Trump was. Some research finds that upward mobility has tumbled in the United States over the last half-century and is now lower than in Europe.
It's particularly hard for people to scramble up when they come from violent homes, poor schools or foster care, or face impediments of race or class. These can be challenges, but they can be addressed to some extent - but not by sermons about bootstraps.
I received a note the other day from a carpenter in Washington State, Mike Stimac, about these issues. He grew up in a small town and describes himself as "more conservative than liberal," but he had read a new book that my wife and I wrote about Americans left behind, and he responded: "I had two parents who gave me a home, no alcohol or physical abuse. I always felt like we were just making it. My parents were blue collar (machinist, sawmill operator, seamstress, cafeteria cook). I never felt like I was privileged, but I see now that I was. ...
"Being a carpenter and general contractor, here again I felt I 'pulled myself up by my bootstraps.' My wife and I made a living with hard work and family help and now have a fairly strong financial standing. But now I realize it is more than hard work and family help. I was privileged to have two parents who valued education (though they never went to college), I am white, and there was no abuse."
Stimac says he now favors substantial federal programs to provide opportunity and address addiction, mental illness and education, adding, "This is a real change of heart for me."
That change of heart is what we need for our country as a whole. American children need fewer wagging fingers or homilies about bootstraps, and more helping hands.

Boy Scouts' bankruptcy is bad news for abuse victims

Texto completo: I never thought anyone would find a way to treat sexual abuse victims worse than the Catholic Church, but the Boy Scouts of America has done it.
By filing for bankruptcy Tuesday, the Boy Scouts likely blocked victims from being able to confront their accusers in court and force them to confess their sins and divulge their secrets. That's because the bankruptcy halts all litigation, nationwide.
There aren't many lawsuits in Pennsylvania because, unlike in some other states including New Jersey and New York, state lawmakers haven't opened a window for retroactive lawsuits by people who were abused as children and lost their right to sue because of the statute of limitations.
And that's at least partly because of the church's influence.
It has lobbied hard for Pennsylvania lawmakers not to pass such a law, especially following a groundbreaking 2018 grand jury report. It disclosed how over seven decades, more than 1,000 Pennsylvania children were sexually abused by hundreds of priests.
Unlike the Boy Scouts, though, the church hasn't broadly sought bankruptcy protection from lawsuits in states where they are easier to file. Less than two dozen dioceses had filed for bankruptcy as of September, according to The New York Times. The Harrisburg Diocese was the first to file in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, citing exposure from abuse claims.
Most dioceses in Pennsylvania set up compensation funds for victims. As of last month, the Allentown Diocese had paid nearly $9 million to 47 victims. Those claims were resolved privately, meaning the victims will remain unknown unless they choose to go public.
By filing for bankruptcy, the Boy Scouts are forcing their victims to go public and file as creditors in the court case. That means their names become part of the public record, unless a judge opts to seal them. That's not right.
One of the leading attorneys in handling cases against the organization, Benjamin Andreozzi of Andreozzi & Associates in Harrisburg, told me Tuesday he doesn't believe that will deter victims from filing.
People don't dig through court files looking for that type of information, he said, and the media generally respect the privacy of sexual abuse victims by not naming them unless they consent to be identified. So while their names technically are public record, those people should retain their privacy.
"It's incredibly unlikely that anyone would ever discover the names," said Andreozzi, whose law firm is listed in the Boy Scouts' bankruptcy filing as one of the 25 firms handling the most abuse claims nationwide. Some are from the Lehigh Valley.
That point still bothers me, though.
What will bother many victims is their inability to get what they consider justice, Andreozzi said. Because they aren't after just money.
"For many survivors of childhood sexual abuse, their definition of justice and closure involves going through a process of exposure and getting answers to questions," he said.
"And you can't fully go through the litigation process when your case is in bankruptcy. You don't get to confront those people who may have been responsible for allowing the perpetrator to get access to you. That is incredibly frustrating for many survivors."
In a column in December, I shared those same laments from a few local church abuse victims.
Juliann Bortz of Lower Macungie, who testified before the grand jury that she was abused by a priest who taught her at Allentown Central Catholic High School in 1965, told me her definition of justice is, "Getting these guys under oath."
Andreozzi told me the Boy Scouts' bankruptcy is going to be a "fairly strong option" when it comes to compensation for victims. I hope so.
In its bankruptcy filing, the organization listed assets between $1 billion and $10 billion and liabilities between $500 million and $1 billion.
The Boy Scouts said in a statement Tuesday that it will continue its programs. That's good news, because like the church, the Boy Scouts do a lot of good for a lot of people.
It still, though, is making life difficult for those it wronged in the past.

Texto completo: Conde Nast, the publishing giant behind Vogue, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, said Friday that it would no longer use nondisclosure agreements for matters involving harassment and discrimination.
Stan Duncan, the company's chief people officer, laid out Conde Nast's new stance in a memo to employees that was shared with The New York Times.
"There are legitimate arguments in favor of NDAs in certain circumstances, which is why their use remains widespread - confidential settlements can spare both employees and employers the cost of litigation, and maintain privacy for all involved," Duncan wrote. "However, given our company's values and commitment to transparency, we have decided that going forward, we will no longer enter into NDAs that prevent an employee from making a disclosure of conduct they were subjected to that they believe, in good faith, constitutes harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. We also expect to release existing NDAs in these matters."
The executive added that the company would release people from existing nondisclosure agreements related to those matters on a case-by-case basis.
The use of nondisclosure agreements across many companies for complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination has become a flash point in the wake of the #MeToo movement. The New Yorker has been at the forefront of the discussion: The magazine won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for Ronan Farrow's investigation into decades of allegations of sexual misconduct by film producer Harvey Weinstein, which involved the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence his accusers.
Weinstein is currently on trial, accused of rape, in New York.
The News Guild of New York, which represents employees at the Conde Nast publications The New Yorker, Pitchfork and Ars Technica, said in a statement Friday that its members applauded the announcement.
"NDAs represent a harmful practice that prevents journalists from holding accountable those who abuse their power - eroding a fundamental principle of journalism," the statement said.

Texto completo: Michigan basketball fans can now book their trip to London.
The inaugural Basketball Hall of Fame London Showcase game against John Calipari and Kentucky basketball will be on Sunday, Dec. 6, 2020, at the O2 Arena.
The Wolverines and Wildcats will tip off at 1 p.m. Eastern (6 p.m. in London) that day.
Tickets for the game go on sale at 5 a.m. Eastern on Thursday on AXS.com. There will be a presale for Michigan basketball season ticket holders and donors beginning at 10 a.m. Tuesday.
The Michigan-Kentucky game will be the second of a doubleheader that day in London, following Marist College and Maryland-Baltimore County.
Late last year, the Michigan game in London was announced. In 2021, Michigan will host Kentucky at Crisler Center. In 2022, the Wolverines will travel to Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky.
The London game was a vision of Calipari, who first said he was considering the overseas game in a summer interview with The Cats' Pause. The game was organized as part of a fundraiser for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, according to the New York Times.

Our decadent energy system needs renewal

Texto completo: For Bloomberg
I read Ross Douthat’s recent essay on “The Age of Decadence” in The New York Times while sprawled on a chaise, picking at my smashed avo and laudanum. Stirring from the languor, I wondered: How does energy fit with this thesis?
Our energy system is decadent at a fundamental level. Roughly four-fifths of what is called primary energy consumption comes from burning fossil fuels, and thermodynamics ensure the majority of that kind of “consumption” is actually just waste heat. We absorb the pump price of buying four gallons of gasoline for the useful energy of one because that one remains incredibly energy-dense and convenient.
The convenience of fossil fuels gets at the other aspect of their decadence. As used currently, they are the definition of living for the moment. Modern society results from our use of coal, oil and gas. But as Thomas Edison lamented a century ago, “we live like squatters,” burning the fixtures for heat, light and transport.
Transitioning away from that model isn’t easy, especially for applications such as aviation, or for the many without decadent levels of income or wealth. Still, in the developed world, our unwillingness to comprehensively price fossil fuels’ externalities — especially greenhouse gas emissions — is at this point a conscious decision to prioritize excesses such as overbuilt SUVs over the coming generations’ access to a safe and prosperous environment.
What’s more decadent than that?
Emerging economies are in a different position, seeking power to attain standards of living achieved by the West decades ago. This underpins a common riposte to calls for decarbonization, effectively casting oil majors and coal miners as the saviors of, say, Bangladeshi farmers. It’s a beguiling argument only if you assume nature gives a damn about inequities and define the standard of living in narrow terms. Diesel-run machinery and coal-fired electricity are undoubted boons to those struggling without them today. But then you must face the troublesome point that Bangladesh is ranked in the top 10 countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
The Gordian knot of addressing climate change while simultaneously serving the world’s underpowered multitudes gets to the part of Douthat’s essay with which energy doesn’t fit. One of his signs of decadence is the apparent exhaustion of meaningful, and profitable, innovation in our self-indulgent, screen-addled 21st century economy: “We used to go to the moon; now we make movies about space.”
Fine. Juicero and all that. Point taken.
Yet the past 10 years have shown the energy sector to be anything but stagnant and inconsequential. U.S. oil and gas production just engineered its biggest decade ever on the back of sheer experimentation (climate folks, hold that thought). It also saw the cost of wind and solar technology decline by approximately 50% and 90%, respectively (90% for lithium-ion battery storage, too). The U.K., whose coal fields birthed the industrial revolution, now goes for days at a time without burning a single lump for its power. And electric vehicles — Edison’s forlorn dream — have gone from curio to dominating marginal growth in several major vehicle markets, including China’s. Work on other potential breakthroughs, ranging from carbon capture to vehicle-to-grid power flows, continues.
As with any dynamic endeavor, there is mess, contradiction and waste. The shale boom that helped tip coal into terminal decline in the U.S. is partly built on the same cheap financing and weak governance underpinning the Silicon Valley flame-outs and deadbeats cited by Douthat. It is also heavily subsidized by the socialization of the costs of its emissions. Renewables have also seen their fair share of dead-end technologies and business models that run on sub-2% Treasuries just as much as photons. Meanwhile, Tesla has undoubtedly pushed electric vehicles further toward the mainstream but sustained profitability, especially at levels commensurate with its valuation, remains elusive.
Yet the profound changes in energy over the past decade have been achieved even in the absence of overhauling its underlying system of incentives and penalties. Imagine what could be done if we actually priced the atmosphere and other natural resources as the scarce commodities they are, rather than just treating them as endless landfill. Besides the decadent West, the technologies encouraged by such signals could also offer sustainable answers to the Bangladeshi farmer’s privations without simultaneously raising profound risks for their descendants.
Like his look back at the men on the moon, Douthat quotes technology tycoon Peter Thiel’s lament that “we wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” Ah, the wryness. But then one recalls that, even as he yearns for innovation, Thiel also went out of his way to help elect a president who floats notions about wind-turbine noise causing cancer and leads a party where many dismiss inconvenient science and ditch their professed faith in market economics whenever carbon enters the equation. Even genius has its foibles.
The point is that there is plenty of innovation happening, and waiting to happen, in energy — if we encourage it. We put a man on the moon because our priority was winning a Cold War. We haven’t yet found an existential need for flying cars.
Dealing with the deferred costs of modernization by retooling our energy grids and transportation is a challenge of even greater importance and scope, encompassing innovation in technology, markets and how we organize our built environment. A cost-effective, scalable means of storing electrical energy for extended periods of time would do far more for society than another lunar landing.
All of this carries moonshot risks and Apollo-level opportunities. And it addresses issues that, even if we have persuaded ourselves otherwise, cut across political affiliation. If decadence is the problem, then few endeavors offer a route to renewal like fixing the ills of our energy system.

IS THE NUCLEAR FAMILY A CURSE FOR AMERICA? THE VULNERABILITY OF THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY UNIT CAN CREATE SIGNIFICANT HARM

Texto completo: When the history of our era is written, scholars will search for larger causes to explain its bitterness and contradictions, despite so much wealth. Was it globalization? Populism? Economic inequality? Polarization? Greed? To this list you can now add an unlikely candidate: the nuclear family.
In a powerful essay for The Atlantic - "The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake" - New York Times columnist David Brooks argues that "the family structure we've held up as the cultural ideal for the past half-century has been a catastrophe for many."
By "nuclear family," he means a married mother and father and some kids. The alternative arrangement was "the extended family," which included not only mom, dad and the children but also close relatives - cousins, aunts, uncles and grandparents - as well as family friends.
The great defect of the nuclear family, Mr. Brooks asserts, is that if there's a crisis - a death, divorce, job loss, poor school grades - there's no backup team. Children are most vulnerable to these disruptions and often are left to fend for themselves. There's a downward spiral. "In many sectors of society," Mr. Brooks writes, "nuclear families fragmented into single-parent families, [and] single-parent families into chaotic families or no families."
People could increasingly go their own way. The advent of the birth-control pill encouraged people to have sex out of marriage. Women's entrance into the labor market made it easier for them to support themselves. Modern appliances (washing machines, dryers) made housework simpler.
As Mr. Brooks sees it, almost everyone loses under this system. The affluent can best cope with it, because they can usually afford what's needed (day care, tutors) to support their children. Otherwise, the picture is bleak.
Children have it worst. Mr. Brooks cites an avalanche of statistics. In 1960, about 5% of children were born to unmarried women. Now that's about 40%. In 1960, about 11% of children lived apart from their father; in 2010, the figure was 27%.
But adult men and women also have their share of troubles. There's a vicious circle at work, notes Mr. Brooks: "People who grow up in disrupted families have more trouble getting the education they need to have prosperous careers. People who don't have prosperous careers have trouble building stable families. ... The children in those families become more isolated and more traumatized."
Mr. Brooks says he wrote the article to stimulate experiments that aim to stabilize family life using the "extended family" - not the nuclear family - as the model. The problem may not be as big as Mr. Brooks imagines. Estimates by the Census Bureau and others indicate that about 60% of Americans live in the state where they were born. Presumably, many of these people stayed put because they valued nearby family ties.
Whatever the actual figures, there's little doubt that reversing the breakdown of families, and its consequences, is one of the urgent tasks of social policy in the 21st century. We have been struggling unsuccessfully with it since the so-called "Moynihan Report" in 1965. (Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who later became a senator, warned that the breakdown of black marriage rates would have a devastating effect on African Americans' well-being.) The report proved highly controversial, and some branded Moynihan a racist.
But even if we could magically eliminate all considerations of class and race, it's not clear that a workable model would emerge. The conditions needed to broach a debate over family policies strike at the heart of Americans political and cultural conflicts. Mr. Brooks put it this way:
"We value privacy and individual freedom too much. Our culture is oddly stuck. We want stability and rootedness, but also mobility, dynamic capitalism, and the liberty to adopt the lifestyle we choose."
Mr. Brooks finds both liberals and conservatives unequal to the task of dealing candidly with family breakdown. "Social conservatives insist that we can bring the nuclear family back. But the conditions that made for stable nuclear families in the 1950s are never returning.
"Conservatives have nothing to say to the kid whose dad has split, whose mom has had three other kids with different dads; 'go live in a nuclear family' is really not relevant advice. . the majority [of households] are something else: single parents, never-married parents, blended families, grandparent-headed families." He's just as tough on progressives. They "still talk like self-expressive individualists of the 1970s: People should have the freedom to pick whatever family form works for them. . But many of the new family forms do not work well for most people."
The larger issue is how we judge our times. We are constantly deluged with economic studies and statistics, implying that economic outcomes are the only ones that matter. The reality is that any national scorecard of well-being must take a much broader view. How well families do in preparing children for adulthood and how well they transmit important values is a much higher standard for success.

Texto completo: BUSINESS BRIEFS
BUSINESS GAUGE TUMBLES TO LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 2013
U.S. business activity shrank in February for the first time since 2013 as the coronavirus hit supply chains and made firms hesitant to place orders. The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index measuring composite output at factories and service providers fell by 3.7 points to 49.6, the lowest level since October 2013, when the U.S. government shut down, according to preliminary figures released Friday. Readings below 50 indicate contraction.
U.S. EXISTING-HOME SALES SOLID AMID SLIM INVENTORY
Sales of previously owned U.S. homes remained robust in January as low borrowing costs and higher wages continue to make purchasing more attainable. Contract closings eased 1.3% from the prior month to a 5.46 million annual rate, according to National Association of Realtors data. The median sales price climbed 6.8% from a year earlier to $266,300 as inventories remained slim.
NEW YORK TIMES POISED TO NAME NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The New York Times Co. is leaning toward naming Meredith Kopit Levien as its next chief executive officer, tapping an internal candidate to succeed Mark Thompson after an eight-year stint, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Levien, currently chief operating officer, is the front-runner to get the top job, with the move potentially coming as soon as April, said one of the people. The Times declined to comment.
UBER ADDS PHONE NUMBER TO BOOK RIDES WITHOUT APP
Uber is not just about the app. It now has a phone number to hail a ride in certain places. The service is geared toward older people or those who like talking to a real person. People in Florida and Arizona, for now, can use it by calling 833-USE-UBER. A live person will confirm the trip request and give a price quote. Follow-up info will come by phone text, including the driver's name and time of arrival.
RICHARD BRANSON LAUNCHES ADULTS-ONLY CRUISE SHIP
Richard Branson is sailing into new waters with the launch of his first cruise liner, making a bold pitch to younger travelers. The Virgin founder launched the Scarlet Lady on Friday, hoping its modern design and adults-only rule will prompt younger vacationers to take a fresh look at cruises. The ship has docked at the Port of Dover in England and will enter operation in April.

Texto completo: The vote was 5 to 4, with the Supreme Court's conservatives in the majority.
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with plans to deny green cards to immigrants who are thought to be likely to become "public charges" by making even occasional and minor use of public benefits like Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers.
As in a similar case last month, the vote was 5 to 4, with the court's conservative justices in the majority. As before, the court's brief order included no reasons for lifting a preliminary injunction that had blocked the new program.
The earlier case, from a judge in New York, concerned a nationwide injunction. Friday's order lifted a much more limited injunction, one that applied only in Illinois.
The new order drew a scathing dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who said the Trump administration had become too quick to run to the Supreme Court after interim losses in the lower courts.
"Claiming one emergency after another, the government has recently sought stays in an unprecedented number of cases, demanding immediate attention and consuming limited court resources in each," she wrote. "And with each successive application, of course, its cries of urgency ring increasingly hollow."
The court's earlier order, she said, at least had the virtue of blocking a nationwide injunction, a form of relief that has been criticized by judges and scholars.
Indeed, two members of the court -- Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas -- issued a concurrence in last month's case indicating that the central problem was the geographic scope of the injunction.
"It has become increasingly apparent that this court must, at some point, confront these important objections to this increasingly widespread practice," Justice Gorsuch wrote. "As the brief and furious history of the regulation before us illustrates, the routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions."
"I concur in the court's decision to issue a stay," Justice Gorsuch continued. "But I hope, too, that we might at an appropriate juncture take up some of the underlying equitable and constitutional questions raised by the rise of nationwide injunctions."
On Friday, Justice Sotomayor wrote that the administration's "own definition of irreparable harm has shifted" after securing that first victory.
"Having first sought a stay in the New York cases based, in large part, on the purported harm created by a nationwide injunction, it now disclaims that rationale and insists that the harm is its temporary inability to enforce its goals in one state," she wrote.
She added that the court had to shoulder its share of the blame.
"It is hard to say," she wrote, "what is more troubling: that the government would seek this extraordinary relief seemingly as a matter of course, or that the court would grant it."
The administration, she wrote, has been treated far better by the justices than death row inmates seeking last-minute stays of executions.
"I fear," she wrote, "that this disparity in treatment erodes the fair and balanced decision-making process that this court must strive to protect."
The administration announced in August that it would revise the so-called public charge rule, which allows officials to deny immigrants permanent legal status, also known as a green card, if they are likely to need public assistance. In the past, only substantial and sustained monetary help or long-term institutionalization counted, and less than 1 percent of applicants were disqualified on public charge grounds.
The administration's revised rule broadened the criteria to include "noncash benefits providing for basic needs such as housing or food" used in any 12 months in a 36-month period. Use of two kinds of benefits in a single month counts as two months, and so on.
The new rule was challenged in courts around the country, and five trial judges entered injunctions blocking it. Appellate courts stayed some but not all of the injunctions while appeals moved forward, and the appeals themselves have been placed on fast tracks.

Texto completo: Joe Biden has recounted a story -- three times in two weeks -- about being arrested on his way to see Nelson Mandela. He did not mention it in his memoir or speak prominently of it before.
LAS VEGAS -- In at least three campaign appearances over the past two weeks, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has told a similar story as he tries to revive his campaign in states with more diverse voters. On a trip to South Africa years ago, he has said, he was arrested as he sought to visit Nelson Mandela in prison.
"This day, 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid," Mr. Biden said at a campaign event in South Carolina last week. "I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robbens Island."
Mr. Biden referred to his own arrest twice more in the next seven days, including at a campaign stop here on Tuesday where he spoke of getting arrested in South Africa between efforts to coax his wife to marry him. That proposal occurred in 1977, both Bidens have said.
But if Mr. Biden, then a United States senator from Delaware, was in fact arrested while trying to visit Mr. Mandela, he did not mention it in his 2007 memoir when writing about a 1970s trip to South Africa, and he has not spoken of it prominently on the 2020 campaign trail. A check of available news accounts by The New York Times turned up no references to an arrest. South African arrest records are not readily available in the United States.
Andrew Young, a former congressman and mayor of Atlanta who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1977 to 1979, said that he had traveled with Mr. Biden over the years, including to South Africa. But Mr. Young said that he had never been arrested in South Africa and expressed skepticism that members of Congress would have faced arrest there.
"No, I was never arrested and I don't think he was, either," Mr. Young, now 87, said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Young added: "Now, people were being arrested in Washington. I don't think there was ever a situation where congressmen were arrested in South Africa." He emphasized his great respect for Mr. Biden, though he said he was currently supporting former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York for the presidency.
Former Senator Gary Hart, a Democrat from Colorado who joined the Senate in 1975 and who was a vocal opponent of apartheid, said in a brief phone call, "I know nothing about that," when asked about Mr. Biden's account.
The Times could not account for all of the details of Mr. Biden's overseas travel during the period that included the South Africa trip. Mr. Biden's campaign did not respond to five efforts to seek comment and clarification.
Mr. Biden's repetition in recent days of the story about an arrest in South Africa comes as he confronts challenging political headwinds. Once the national front-runner, he turned in disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire, two heavily white states, where he finished fourth and fifth, respectively. His campaign is banking on at least a second-place finish in Nevada on Saturday and a victory in South Carolina, two diverse states where voters of color play crucial roles. He regularly uses his remarks to try to connect with black voters, such as saying in Nevada and elsewhere that he was "raised in the black church."
In South Carolina in particular, Mr. Biden is pinning his hopes on a strong showing with African-American voters, a constituency with which he polled strongly throughout much of the race, though he now faces increasing competition for the support of black voters.
After recounting the story of his arrest while campaigning in South Carolina last week, Mr. Biden subsequently told it twice more in Nevada, mistakenly saying Robbens Island instead of Robben, where Mr. Mandela was held for much of his 27-year imprisonment.
And on Sunday, as he had in South Carolina, he also delivered a coda to the story.
"After he got free and became president, he came to Washington and came to my office," Mr. Biden said of Mr. Mandela at a black history awards brunch in Las Vegas. "He threw his arms around me and said, 'I want to say thank you.' I said, 'What are you thanking me for, Mr. President?' He said, 'You tried to see me. You got arrested trying to see me."'
On Tuesday, speaking in Las Vegas at an event with Asian-American and Pacific Islander voters, he said that he "came back from South Africa, trying to see Nelson Mandela and getting arrested for trying to see him," right before he received an answer to his marriage proposal from his now-wife, Jill Biden.
Mr. Biden has previously discussed visiting South Africa as a young senator -- but his emphasis in discussing his travel there has not been on an arrest.
In a December 2013 clip from CBS News, Mr. Biden, expressing admiration for Mr. Mandela, mentioned a congressional delegation trip he took to South Africa. He also described being thanked, years later, by the iconic civil rights leader, but did not mention his own arrest. Instead, he said Mr. Mandela expressed gratitude for his support of anti-apartheid sanctions.
In a 2013 statement marking the death of Mr. Mandela, Mr. Biden, then vice president, recalled how he had traveled to Soweto with Mr. Young, but he did not mention an arrest.
"I saw his world the way it used to be when I visited South Africa as a 34-year-old senator," the statement said. "When I exited the plane I was directed to one side of the tarmac, while the African-American congressmen traveling with me were sent to the other side. I refused to break off, and the officials finally relented. When I tried to enter Soweto township with Congressmen Andrew Young of Atlanta and Charles Diggs of Detroit, I remember their tears of anger and sadness."
Mr. Young, in the phone interview, said he did encounter discrimination on his trips to South Africa over the years, but said, "I would not forget going to jail, but I know I did not ever go to jail in South Africa."
Mr. Biden and Dr. Biden wrote about a South Africa trip in their memoirs, too. According to their accounts, Mr. Biden went there after giving Dr. Biden an ultimatum following multiple marriage proposals. They both have said that Mr. Biden sought a response when he returned from the trip.
Neither Mr. Biden nor Dr. Biden mentioned an arrest when describing the proposal.
"The 10 days in Africa felt like forever," Mr. Biden wrote in his book "Promises to Keep." "I had gotten through worse, but I knew that if Jill said no, it was going to hurt like hell."
It was in that context -- a lighthearted retelling of multiple marriage proposals -- that Mr. Biden brought up Mr. Mandela at the campaign event on Tuesday.
"When I came back," he said, "first thing I did, I landed in Philadelphia and I went back to her apartment."
Last year, Mr. Biden faced scrutiny after The Washington Post reported that he had misstated details in a story about the war in Afghanistan that he told on the campaign trail.
Former Senator Bob Kerrey, a supporter of Mr. Biden's who joined the Senate in 1989 as a Democrat from Nebraska, suggested that perhaps there could have been an arrest of senators but no charges by the government, and noted, "a step away from arrest is to be detained."
"I had some senators I wish had been arrested," Mr. Kerrey joked in a phone interview. "He's not on that list."
But he said that he had never heard the story before.

Got an Unexpected Check in the Mail? It May Be Fishy

Texto completo: Check scams are on the rise, the F.T.C. says, and many of the victims are in their 20s, with little check-writing experience.
Fraud involving fake checks has mushroomed in recent years, and the victims are often young adults, a new federal analysis found.
In fake check schemes, criminals send checks to their victims, who deposit them. The money initially shows up in the victims' bank accounts. Then the criminals -- using a variety of ploys, like phony job offers, "overpayment" for an item bought online or bogus sweepstakes -- persuade the victims to send some of the money back, often by wire transfer or a gift card. The check eventually bounces, leaving the victim owing money to the bank.
Reports of check fraud have risen 65 percent since 2015, and the typical loss is about $ 2,000 -- much higher than losses for other types of fraud, the Federal Trade Commission reported this month. Last year, the commission's fraud network received more than 27,000 reports of fake check scams, with losses of more than $ 28 million.
People in their 20s are more than twice as likely as those over 30 to report losing money in the schemes, the commission found. College students, for instance, have reported that the scam started with a message to their student email address.
"It's really jarring to see twice as many people in their 20s reporting losses," said Monica Vaca, associate director of consumer response and operations at the F.T.C.
One reason young people may be more likely to become victims is that they are probably less familiar with how paper checks work, experts say. While federal rules require that banks make funds available quickly for withdrawal -- usually within a day or two, depending on the type of check -- there can be a delay of several days or even weeks before a check is fully verified.
"They're just not used to writing checks," said John Breyault, vice president of policy at the National Consumer League, an advocacy group. He added that this meant they were even less familiar than most Americans with the mechanics of check processing. The Federal Reserve has reported that the number of checks written in general has declined greatly since 2000. And Mr. Breyault cited a study that found about a third of Generation Z, whose oldest members are in their mid-20s, had never used a paper check.
Also, check ruses often involve an offer of employment, which young adults may find attractive. About half of the people who reported a fake-check scam to the F.T.C. last year said they had been offered a job or some other way to earn cash, such as being hired as a "mystery" shopper or participating in "car wrap" advertising gigs.
The pitches vary, but all check scams have two elements: a check to deposit and a rationale for why you must send some of the money to someone else, perhaps by wiring it through a money transfer service or by loading cash onto a gift card (Google Play and iTunes are popular) and providing the P.I.N.
"Con artists favor these payment methods because once the money is sent," the F.T.C. said, "it is almost impossible to trace or reverse."
Ms. Vaca said the criminals "create an illusion," adding: "You have a check in your hand, then a deposit in your bank account. It doesn't look fake. It feels completely risk free."
In one account detailed in a Better Business Bureau report in 2018, a student in Oakland, Calif., received an offer at her college email address. The "very professional looking" message said she could earn $ 250 a week by driving her car around after having it "wrapped" with an ad for Mountain Dew. (Banks have issued warnings about "shrink wrap" scams involving beer and energy drink brands.)
She took the job to help pay her tuition, and received a check in the mail for $ 4,850 -- ostensibly to pay for the wrap job. She deposited the check and the next day was able to withdraw $ 3,500, which she redeposited -- as instructed -- into a separate bank account held by the "car specialist."
The student grew suspicious, however, when she received a text message telling her to withdraw an additional $ 500 and put it on an iTunes gift card, and she reported the situation to the police. The criminal's bank account had been closed, and the money was gone. Her own bank demanded that she repay the $ 3,500, so she agreed to an installment plan to pay off her losses.
Think you wouldn't fall for it? Think again. People fall prey to schemes because of "optimism bias," a bureau report found; they think typical victims are older, gullible or even stupid and don't see themselves that way. In truth, the Better Business Bureau report noted, "we are all vulnerable."
Here are some questions and answers about fake check fraud:
If the check was fake and I was a victim, why do I have to repay my bank?
Customers are responsible for bounced checks because they are generally in the best position to evaluate whether a check they deposit is legitimate, said Nessa Feddis, senior vice president at the American Bankers Association.
The law requires banks to make funds available because most checks are valid, she said, and people need the money to pay expenses. But "just because money is in the account doesn't mean the check is good," Ms. Feddis said.
It's only when the check works its way through the verification process that it is discovered to be a fake. Criminals take advantage of the time to trick their victims.
Victims often say they felt something was "fishy," Ms. Feddis said. "We encourage people to trust their instincts," she said. If something doesn't seem right, ask questions and talk to your bank before proceeding, she said. Be cautious if you don't know the person offering the check.
"Be wary of strangers," she added.
For more information, visit the association's website.
How can I tell if a check is legitimate?
The Better Business Bureau offers tips for identifying fake checks. But it's increasingly difficult, even for bank employees, to spot a counterfeit because advanced graphics and printing technology make it easy to create real-looking fake checks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said.
"If someone you don't know initiated the payment, be skeptical and proceed cautiously," the F.D.I.C. advised.
Fake checks may be made out for more than the expected amount; that's often how criminals persuade people to send the "overpayment" back to them. Make sure the check was issued by a legitimate bank: You can check an institution's name on the F.D.I.C.'s BankFind tool.
If the check looks real but someone is asking you to cash it and send money back, that's a red flag. There's virtually no legitimate reason for that sort of request, the F.T.C. said, warning, "If someone you don't know sends you a check and asks for money back, that's a scam."
What if I am a victim of a fake check fraud?
You should notify your bank as soon as you realize what has happened. Depending on the circumstances, your institution may agree to cover the loss, said Mr. Breyault of the National Consumer League.
Ms. Feddis of the American Bankers Association said banks had discretion to offer a payment plan, depending on the customer's financial circumstances.
The F.D.I.C. suggests immediately notifying one or more agencies. You can report the fraud to the F.T.C. on its complaint website. If the fake check arrived by mail, you can notify the United States Postal Inspection Service. You can notify your state or local consumer protection agency, which can usually be found through your state attorney general. For possible online crimes involving fake checks and money orders, you can file a complaint with the F.B.I.'s Internet Crime Complaint Center.
The Better Business Bureau also offers a fraud complaint website.

As Trump Grabs Billions to Build Border Wall, Congress's Grasp on Purse Weakens

Texto completo: The administration's plan to divert more military funds to building a border wall is the latest example of the long-running erosion of Congress's power of the purse.
WASHINGTON -- When the Pentagon announced this month that it would divert billions more dollars in military funding to the construction of President Trump's border wall, bipartisan outrage ricocheted across Capitol Hill.
Republicans and Democrats alike issued fiery statements in defense of both their congressional districts, some of which stand to lose valuable work making military equipment, and their constitutionally enshrined power of the purse. But the howls of protest are unlikely to amount to much in a Congress where lawmakers -- many of whom once prized their spending prerogatives almost above all else -- acknowledge their power to steer federal dollars has been severely eroded.
The dysfunction has taken hold in large part because of decisions that members of Congress themselves have made. But it has become particularly pronounced under Mr. Trump, who has moved aggressively to divert government money when it suits his agenda.
"Congress's appropriation power, which is pretty much the last unchallenged power that Congress has, has very significantly eroded," said Sean Q. Kelly, a professor of political science at California State University Channel Islands.
The root of the problem predates Mr. Trump. For years, Congress has jammed through huge omnibus spending bills that set funding for an entire fiscal year in the final days of legislative sessions. Lawmakers have also passed a patchwork of short-term spending bills to keep the government from shutting down, which has happened three times during the Trump administration. And while presidents have always had the power to transfer and reallocate funds, Mr. Trump has made far wider use of that authority to subvert the will of lawmakers.
The administration is expected to announce another diversion of funds to help pay for construction of a wall on the southern border, Mr. Trump's signature campaign promise, in the coming months. The president declared a national emergency last year to allow him to use money not appropriated for the wall to build it.
And while the Senate acquitted Mr. Trump this month of impeachment charges stemming from his decision to withhold military funding from Ukraine, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan federal watchdog, found that Mr. Trump's actions violated the Impoundment Control Act, which limits a president's ability to refuse to spend money allocated by Congress.
Several lawmakers, including some who are still deeply involved in crafting the dozen must-pass spending bills each year, acknowledge that the annual fiscal process no longer works as it once did. A large factor, several say, is the demise of earmarks, the power to steer money to lawmakers' pet projects in order to persuade them to take tough votes. Long scorned as a tool of corruption, Congress ultimately banned the practice after a series of scandals that culminated in the imprisonment of the lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
"When earmarks were around, they gave members a reason to pay attention to appropriations -- they always knew they had some skin in the game," said Mr. Kelly, who co-wrote a book about earmarks and their benefit to democracy. "By being penny-wise, we've sort of been pound-foolish."
Some lawmakers in both parties have quietly begun discussing reviving earmarks in a bid to help grease the gears of the spending process. Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, embarked on a listening tour among her colleagues about rebranding earmarks as "community project funding" and implementing more guardrails to avoid abuse. Mr. Trump has also suggested bringing the practice back in some form.
"Members of Congress have the best judgment about what's needed for their districts," Ms. Lowey said in an interview in which she described how the administration now wields far more discretion in doling out funds for projects. "Local projects and spending bills also give members a sense of ownership of federal funding."
But the idea has been shelved for the time being. House Democratic leaders hope to pass all 12 spending bills by the end of June, and any effort to revive earmarks was seen as too complex and politically fraught to pursue in such a short time frame and in an election year.
"Clearly, there's a sentiment in the institution that we surrender too much power," said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and a member of the Appropriations Committee, who supports the idea of bringing back the practice in some form. "How you get that power back without undercutting the current chief executive, and how you have that discussion in a way that it doesn't partisan-ize it and sends everybody to their corners, is really going to be very tricky."
Fiscal conservatives -- particularly Republicans who ran for Congress as budget hawks bent on lowering the debt and reducing government spending -- are reluctant to undercut that message now by embracing earmarks. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff who railed against spending during his years as a South Carolina congressman, acknowledged in a recent private question-and-answer session that Republicans are less interested in deficit reduction now that a member of their party is in the White House.
A Democratic aide, insisting on anonymity to describe internal discussions, said that party leaders planned to revisit the discussion of earmarks next year, given the near-unanimous support for it among their members in Congress. Other aides and lawmakers pointed to the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, a bipartisan committee formed to offer suggestions on how to improve and update the legislative branch, as a possible avenue to explore more substantial reforms to the system.
In the meantime, the administration has taken advantage of the natural murkiness that comes with funding programs and policy -- and encountered little resistance from lawmakers.
"Congress has been more and more deferential to the president when they're of the same party," said Joshua C. Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute. "But on the other hand, we haven't seen a president deviate from appropriations to such a degree."
While the Government Accountability Office found that Mr. Trump's decision to withhold $ 391 million in security assistance for Ukraine violated the law, there is no action or penalty that can be taken as a result.
"These parchment barriers are only as effective so far as when people in power hold themselves to the law," said James P. Pfiffner, a professor at George Mason University who wrote a book about the impoundment act. "If the person with the most power says, 'I'm not going to play by the rules of the game,' the other people may have the authority, but not the power to enforce the law."
This month, when Russell T. Vought, the acting head of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, appeared before the House Budget Committee for the first time since defying congressional subpoenas in the impeachment inquiry, only one lawmaker -- Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky and the committee's chairman -- even asked about the agency's obligation to implement congressional spending priorities.
"We believe that we need to abide by the appropriation that you pass, by Congress," Mr. Vought said. "We look at the appropriations law and we look at the authorization law. We figure out what our flexibility is within that framework."
Mr. Yarmuth and other top Democrats have said that they plan to pursue legislation that would toughen the Impoundment Control Act, and Senate Democrats have introduced legislation to curb the reach of the national emergency power. But neither measure is likely to survive in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Wendy J. Schiller, a professor of political science at Brown University, called it a "story of unintended consequences" that is unlikely to be immediately reversed by future administrations.
"Trump inherited a presidency that was already getting much more powerful than Congress," Ms. Schiller said. "I don't think the next president is going to want to relinquish that power. Why would he or she?"

Texto completo: The corporate home of The New Yorker, which reported on Harvey Weinstein and others who have used nondisclosure agreements to silence accusers, steps back from a common settlement tactic.
Condé Nast, the publishing giant behind Vogue, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, said on Friday that it would no longer use nondisclosure agreements for matters involving harassment and discrimination.
Stan Duncan, the company's chief people officer, laid out Condé Nast's new stance in a memo to employees that was shared with The New York Times.
"There are legitimate arguments in favor of NDAs in certain circumstances, which is why their use remains widespread -- confidential settlements can spare both employees and employers the cost of litigation, and maintain privacy for all involved," Mr. Duncan wrote.
"However, given our company's values and commitment to transparency," he added, "we have decided that going forward, we will no longer enter into NDAs that prevent an employee from making a disclosure of conduct they were subjected to that they believe, in good faith, constitutes harassment, discrimination or retaliation. We also expect to release existing NDAs in these matters."
The executive added that the company would release people from existing nondisclosure agreements related to those matters on a case-by-case basis.
The use of nondisclosure agreements for workers who make complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination has become a point of contention in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and The New Yorker has been at the forefront of the discussion. The magazine won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for Ronan Farrow's investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by the film producer Harvey Weinstein, which involved the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence his accusers. (The Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey were also awarded the Pulitzer that year for their investigation into Mr. Weinstein.)
Mr. Weinstein is currently on trial, accused of rape, in Manhattan.
During the Democratic presidential primary debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized Michael R. Bloomberg for the use of nondisclosure agreements at his company, Bloomberg L.P. He had refused to release some female former employees from agreements they signed after accusing him of harassment and discrimination. (Mr. Bloomberg announced on Friday that he would release three women from nondisclosure agreements if they contacted the company.)
Condé Nast's decision to limit the use of nondisclosure agreements was reported earlier by The Daily Beast.
The union that represents employees at The New Yorker and the Condé Nast publications Pitchfork and Ars Technica had proposed that the company drop nondisclosure agreements at the bargaining table for The New Yorker in November, said Susan DeCarava, the president of the union, the NewsGuild of New York.
"We had been having a conversation throughout our union that I think was mirrored culturally and socially about the damage that NDAs cause in workplaces," Ms. DeCarava said.
"It has been particularly acute for our membership, in part because many of our members are among those who broke stories about rampant misconduct, abuse and harassment," she added. "There's also the hypocrisy of media companies on one hand employing people to expose these things and on the other hand utilizing these very same mechanisms, oftentimes in the very same newsroom."
Ms. DeCarava said Condé Nast's announcement was welcome, but urged the company to include the new policy in its formal agreements with the union. She added that the NewsGuild hoped the company would broaden the policy and release anyone who had signed a nondisclosure agreement, without exception.
A Condé Nast spokesman said the company had been reviewing its use of nondisclosure agreements since the merger of its American and international businesses last year.
The New Yorker Union, which is part of the NewsGuild, said in a statement on Friday that it was encouraged by the new policy, but added that Condé Nast should "commit itself to the elimination of this dangerous practice."

Outbreak's Grim Toll on Global Business

Texto completo: The disruption of China's manufacturing network, and slowdown of its economy, have rippled through to airlines, automakers, tech companies and more.
A loss of $ 29 billion in airline revenue. China auto sales down by 92 percent. Interruptions for Procter & Gamble's 387 suppliers in China.
As the coronavirus outbreak rattles the global economy and disrupts supply chains, international companies across nearly every industry are confronting a stark reality: Business will not go on as usual.
And investors have taken notice. U.S. stocks fell for the second-straight day on Friday. Shares of energy, airline and technology companies led the broader market lower on Wall Street, as the S&P closed more than 1 percent lower, putting it on pace for its worst day of the month. Oil and gas prices also fell, with the price of a barrel of benchmark American crude slipping nearly 1 percent. The markets have become more volatile since the outbreak, but American investors have largely shrugged off the threat. Since Jan. 7, when Chinese officials identified the virus, the S&P 500 remains up more than 3 percent, even after this morning's sell-off. -- Matt Philips
Airlines are expected to lose billions in revenue this year.
The International Air Transport Association this week warned of a deep downturn in earnings among global carriers related to the collapse of travel in Asia because of the virus.
The virus outbreak could reduce global airline revenue by about $ 29 billion in this year, resulting in a small industry contraction compared with 2019, it said.
Virtually all of the losses are expected to hit airlines in the Asia-Pacific region, which are facing a 13 percent decline in passenger demand for the year, according to the association's analysis.
Some airlines have begun to acknowledge the outbreak's effects, with Air France-KLM Group and Australia's Qantas Group separately warning on Thursday of a potential financial hit.
Qantas said that the coronavirus could reduce its profit for the fiscal year that ends June 30 by $ 66 million to $ 99 million, while Air France-KLM estimated a hit to earnings of as much as $ 216 million between February and April this year.
More than 20 international airlines have suspended or restricted routes that end in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, and other major Chinese cities.
And airlines in Asia are cutting flights elsewhere. Singapore Airlines said it would temporarily cut flights between the city state and major destinations like New York, Paris, London, Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney.
Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong carrier, has also canceled nearly all of its flights to mainland China and is reducing service elsewhere over the next two months. -- Niraj Chokshi and Amie Tsang
Auto sales tumble.
Auto sales in China collapsed this month, with the Chinese Passenger Car Association saying that sales at dealerships had plummeted 92 percent in the first half of February compared with the same time last year.
China is the world's biggest car market by a wide margin. So a nose-dive in sales there hurts the global industry.
The German luxury auto giant Daimler -- which makes Mercedes-Benz -- cautioned in its annual report that the virus could lead to a significant drop in Chinese economic growth. The report said the virus "may not only affect the development of unit sales, but may also lead to significant adverse effects on production, the procurement market and the supply chain."
Jaguar Land Rover warned that the coronavirus could soon begin to create production problems at its assembly plants in Britain.
Like many carmakers, Jaguar Land Rover uses parts made in China. With factories there shut down or operating at reduced capacity, assembly lines in the rest of the world are expected to run short of essential components. -- Keith Bradsher
Apple's iPhone manufacturer warns about impact.
With much of China still on lockdown, businesses are struggling to get workers back and factories running.
In a release this week, Foxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronics and a key player in Apple's supply chain, indicated just how difficult that will be. Foxconn said its revenue would take a hit from the spread of the coronavirus, and that it would be "cautious" in resuming work at its factories in China. Plants outside of the country, in places like Vietnam and Mexico, were at full capacity, the company said.
The revenue warning comes as Chinese leaders try to balance restarting the economy with controlling the virus. Concerns about Foxconn's production also underscore the potential broader impact the epidemic could have on global electronic supply chains. A huge portion of the world's electronics come out of China's factories, filled with parts also made in China's factories, and a longer suspension of production could hit overall supply. Some have even warned that it could hasten a decoupling, which has been urged at times by both Chinese and American leaders out of security concerns. -- Paul Mozur
Procter & Gamble says its finances will suffer.
Procter & Gamble, the consumer products behemoth, said in a federal filing this week that disruptions to supply and demand caused by the outbreak would "materially" affect the company's quarterly results.
"China is our second largest market -- sales and profit," Jon R. Moeller, a company executive, said at a conference in New York on Thursday, according to the filing. "Store traffic is down considerably, with many stores closed or operating with reduced hours. Some of the demand has shifted online but supply of delivery operators and labor is limited."
The company relies on 387 suppliers in China, each facing difficulties in resuming operations, Mr. Moeller said. -- Niraj Chokshi
France warns of 'over-dependence on China.'
The French government said it would urge companies to review their "over-dependence" on China for raw materials and parts as the outbreak exposes weaknesses among French manufacturers that have outsourced their supply chains there.
The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, singled out automakers, which have been having trouble getting parts like brake pedals, and the pharmaceutical industry, which gets 80 percent of the raw materials for some drugs from China and Asia.
The government estimated the economy may shrink by around 0.1 percent this year as result of the outbreak. Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, is home to more than one third of all French investment in China. -- Liz Alderman
China's central bank cuts rates.
China's banks are lowering borrowing costs for companies and households to try to soften the economic blow of the coronavirus.
The move follows a rash of policies from China's central bank to shore up an economy hobbled by weeks of a near nationwide shutdown of business. On Thursday, the People's Bank of China said it lowered the one-year loan prime rate to 4.05 percent from 4.15 percent, and slashed the five-year loan rate to 4.75 percent from 4.8 percent.
Economists are lowering their growth expectations for China this year as businesses are only just beginning -- somewhat haltingly -- to get back to work. Some said the move would do little to address the widespread impact of the epidemic on China's once vibrant business community. -- Alexandra Stevenson
Adidas says sales in China have plummeted 85 percent.
Adidas, the German sportswear maker, said that its mainland China business had been decimated by the outbreak.
Sales in the region dropped by about 85 percent since Chinese New Year on Jan. 25, the company said, compared with the same period a year ago. Fewer shoppers in South Korea and Japan also contributed to the falloff in sales, a result of the sharp drop in Chinese tourism that has also affected the aviation and hospitality sectors as well as the fashion retail business.
Adidas sells its products from about 12,000 stores in China, around 500 of them its own stores and the rest franchises. -- Elizabeth Paton

Texto completo: Eyal Weizman, the director of the investigative group, said an embassy official in London told him an algorithm had identified a security threat that was related to him.
Over the last decade Eyal Weizman and his colleagues within the London-based investigative group Forensic Architecture have examined violent occurrences around the world, often using video and architectural rendering software in efforts to parse confusing and often murky political and corporate events.
Last week Mr. Weizman confronted an unexpected mystery when he was informed by email that his right to travel to the United States under a visa waiver program had been revoked. The next day, on Feb. 14, he went to the U.S. Embassy in London to apply for a visa, but, he said, an official told him, without elaboration that an algorithm had identified a security threat that was related to him.
Mr. Weizman, who holds British and Israeli passports, had hoped to attend the opening of an art exhibition Wednesday night at Miami Dade College's Museum of Art and Design. Called "True to Scale," it is a survey of Forensic Architecture's work. Mr. Weizman said by email on Wednesday that he has visited the United States dozens of times, most recently in December 2019.
He said that the embassy official had told him that the threat that surfaced could be related to something he was involved in, people he had been in contact with, places he had visited, hotels at which he had stayed, or a pattern of relations among those.
He said an official at the embassy asked him to provide information about his travel over the last 15 years including who had paid for it and questioned him specifically about whether he had been to Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen or Somalia.
He was also asked, he said, to name anyone he knew who may have triggered the algorithm, so that Department of Homeland Security investigators could more quickly assess his case. Mr. Weizman did not answer the questions, he said, and remained in London.
"You would be putting people at risk by reporting their names," Mr. Weizman said in a telephone interview. "This is something we should not be asked to do as human rights investigators."
Responding to requests for comment from the Department of Homeland Security, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in an email that as part of security efforts, officers may refer people for additional screening based on factors that could include a combination of an individual's activities, associations, and travel patterns.
And the State Department, which has described its screening processes as important to national security, said it could not comment on Mr. Weizman's account. "Visa records are confidential under U.S. law; therefore, we cannot discuss the details of individual visa cases," the agency said in a statement.
On Wednesday night, at the opening in Miami, his wife, Ines Weizman, presented a statement he had written that said in part: "I am alarmed that relations among our colleagues, stakeholders and staff are being targeted by the U.S. government as security threats."
The statement also said that immigration officials had questioned Ms. Weizman for more than two hours when she flew into New York last week.
Forensic Architecture, which Mr. Weizman founded in 2010, is based at Goldsmiths, University of London. The group has investigated the fatal shooting of a Palestinian teenager by an Israeli border guard, assembled evidence of a Russian military presence in eastern Ukraine and produced an interactive cartographic web platform showing U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan.
Last year The New York Times worked with Forensic Architecture while producing an Emmy Award-winning project called "One Building, One Bomb," which reconstructed a chemical attack by Syrian government forces on civilians.
Also last year a Forensic Architecture video, "Triple Chaser," which examined the use of tear gas manufactured by an American company, Safariland Group, was included in the Whitney Biennial.
Laura Poitras, whose Praxis Films collaborated on that video, said she admired Forensic Architecture's rigorous and multidisciplinary methodology, which often combines open source data, like video, with architectural models of buildings and landscapes.
"Forensic Architecture is doing completely innovative work," she said. "It's evidentiary and fact-based and oftentimes counters what a government is saying."
For years, during both Democratic and Republican administrations, the United States has declined to issue visas to certain people.
In 2011, for instance, Kerim Yildiz, a human rights advocate for the Kurdish people, waited more than a year for a visa to enter the United States from London. Last year Omar Barghouti, a co-founder of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, also known as B.D.S., which encourages economic pressure on Israel over its treatment of Palestinians, was barred from entering the country.
The American Civil Liberties Union has long criticized "ideological exclusion," which it says keeps Americans from meeting with foreign speakers whose opinions the government dislikes.
Mr. Weizman said that in addition to attending the opening in Miami he had planned to meet with people to discuss investigating a facility in Homestead, Fla., that is used to house detained migrant children.
Now, Mr. Weizman said, he may have another topic to examine.
"Associative algorithms, triangulating algorithms, that look at patterns that look at relations between actions and movement, between people and places," he said. "We need to gear up to be able identify and monitor those."

Texto completo: Next week's greatest hits include Marlon James, journalists on economic crisis and debut authors Brandon Taylor and April Davila.
Living among fellow scientists
Before Brandon Taylor was a writer and editor, he was a biochemist. "For the better part of several years, I saw my lab mates every day," Taylor writes in an article for Buzzfeed, "We supported each other. We fought. We feuded. We gossiped... A lab is a family. In a way." The protagonist of Taylor's debut novel, "Real Life," is a gay black biochemistry student navigating friendship and romance at a Midwestern university. Taylor imbues his work with what the New Yorker calls "the precision of science and the intimacy of memoir." Taylor discusses his book with MEL contributor Miles Klee.

The fading U.S. blue-collar jobs
New York Times op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof grew up in the small working-class town of Yamhill, Ore., where his family enjoyed a pastoral life. When Kristof returned home decades later, he discovered that his hometown had been decimated by addiction, depression and financial strife. Using Yamhill as a starting point, Kristof and his wife Sheryl WuDunn's book "Tightrope, Americans Reaching for Hope" reveals how rural America has suffered as blue-collar towns have lost their union jobs. Times reviewer William Nottingham, wrote that the authors show how "cycles of poverty, drug abuse, unemployment" have "left not quite half of our nation adrift and seemingly destined to stay that way." Kristof and WuDunn -- the first husband and wife team to share a journalism Pulitzer Prize -- talk with Willow Bay, dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.

America's grim housing market
California's home sale price record was annihilated this month when Jeff Bezos bought a $165-million mansion in Beverly Hills. For nonbillionaires, California's housing market is a much tougher sell. New York Times journalist Conor Dougherty has covered the West Coast housing crisis, recounting the economic disparity in his Bay Area home base and beyond. His book "Golden Gates: Fighting for Housing in America" delves deep into the historical factors that spawned the current calamity. He discusses his book with Times columnist Steve Lopez.

Riveting epic African fantasy
Before it even landed on bookshelves, Booker Prize winner Marlon James' fantasy epic "Black Leopard, Red Wolf" was dubbed the "African 'Game of Thrones.' "
When the book finally came out in 2019, James joked about the expectations of George R.R. Martin fans: "They're going to be so disappointed ... except for the sex and violence." It was clear that James' expansive world -- partly based on African myth -- was actually much more daring than bad-breathed dragons and overcaffeinated zombies. James eschewed Western story structures, instead opting for a phantasmagorical griot tale that was queer as heck. In his review for The Times, author Jeff Vandermeer called the book "bawdy (OK, filthy), lyrical, poignant, violent (sometimes hyperviolent), riotous, funny (filthily hilarious), complex, mysterious, and always under tight and exquisite control." James discusses his book, and if you ask nicely he might explain how he landed Venezuelan illustrator Pablo Gerardo Camacho for his eye-catching cover art.
8 p.m. Thursday, Glorya Kaufman Dance Theater at UCLA, 20 Westwood Plaza, Westwood. $46.

Texto completo: Readers praise the judge's handling of the case and wonder why the convicted friend of the president was smiling on his way to his sentencing. Also: Russian interference and Republicans.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Adviser Sentenced to 40 Months" (front page, Feb. 21) and "1,100 Ex-Federal Lawyers Press for Barr to Step Down" (news article, Feb. 17):
The truth does still matter. That was Judge Amy Berman Jackson's refrain in handing down a 40-month prison sentence to Roger Stone, President Trump's longtime friend and self-proclaimed "dirty trickster" who was convicted of lying to Congress and witness tampering.
As one of the (now) over 2,500 former Department of Justice lawyers and officials who called for Attorney General William Barr to resign, I applaud Judge Jackson's eminently fair sentence. My only regret is that the judge didn't call Mr. Barr to testify under oath regarding his role in how the second Justice Department recommendation for a lighter sentence came about.
Judge Jackson is a straight shooter with a deep moral core. She gave Roger Stone the tongue-lashing he deserved, and in doing so she reminded us that truth still matters. A judge with a moral core. We could use more of them.

To the Editor:
What's wrong with this picture? On Friday's front page is a photo with the caption: "Roger J. Stone Jr., convicted of lying to protect the president, arriving for his sentencing Thursday." Mr. Stone and his companion are smiling. Who smiles on the way to a sentencing? What does he know that we don't know?

Warning About Russian Interference
To the Editor:
Re "House Is Warned of Russian Effort to Bolster Trump" (front page, Feb. 21):
What kind of political environment are we living in when it is viewed as a "tactical error" by the intelligence community to present to the House Intelligence Committee the conclusion that Russia is meddling again to benefit President Trump? Republicans are clearly so afraid of Mr. Trump that they want nothing to do with information that they feel feeds into his insecurity about the legitimacy of his 2016 election.
Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have an obligation to review all information with an eye to wherever the truth leads them, not with an eye on how Mr. Trump will react. Their inability to do so is just one more indication of Republican abdication of Congress's role as a coequal branch of government.

I can imagine President Trump's response: "You make it sound as if there is anything wrong with it."

Texto completo: Paris officials have delayed reopening parts of the landmark cathedral damaged by fire several times.
LONDON -- The crypt and parts of Notre-Dame Cathedral's plaza are expected to reopen to the public in the spring, Paris officials said this week -- almost a year after the landmark 850-year-old building was mauled by a fire that devoured its roof, weakened its structure and sent shock waves through France and beyond.
The beloved cathedral, the park behind it and the plaza nearby have remained closed amid fears of lead contamination from the damaged church roof and spire. Dozens of workers have been repairing the building that President Emmanuel Macron vowed at the time of the blaze would reopen within five years.
This week, Paris's deputy mayor, Emmanuel Grégoire, said he hoped that parts of the square in front of the cathedral would become accessible again to the public in the first half of the year "if everything goes OK."
Mr. Grégoire told a group of lawmakers that workers would first have to remove lead traces from the site, since levels there and in the cathedral's rubble remain a cause for significant concern.
The workers have sorted the rubble under tents set up in the forecourt, strengthened flying buttresses and other damaged parts of the buildings, and prepared to remove a massive scaffolding that had been set up around the cathedral's roof before the fire to help workers carry out renovations.
Another deputy mayor, Karen Taïeb, said the crypt, a museum under the plaza, would reopen at the end of March if the site did not present risks of pollution.
"Obviously this depends on whether the site has been properly cleaned up, but we have been doing regular lead checks," said Ms. Taïeb, who is in charge of historical monuments in Paris.
Ms. Taïeb and Mr. Grégoire spoke on Wednesday to lawmakers who are part of a parliamentary commission on the restoration of the church.
Mr. Grégoire did not say which parts of the forecourt would be reopened, or when. City officials have delayed the reopening several times, because the techniques used to remove lead traces are dependent on the weather.
The French authorities were criticized last summer for not cleaning nearby schools, day care centers and public parks that were contaminated with toxic dust, sowing confusion that officials may have privileged the cathedral's reconstruction over safety.
On the plaza -- which has remained open to workers and security employees, many of whom worked without protection in the first weeks after the fire -- lead levels were up to 1,300 times above the French safety guidelines, according to confidential measurements made by the government and obtained by The New York Times in August. On nearby pavements and in the immediate surroundings of the construction site, lead levels were 955 times above the threshold.
On the site, construction workers are expected to start removing the damaged scaffolding next month, an essential step in renovating the cathedral. The operation, which will take months to complete, has been delayed because of poor weather conditions.
The construction site and fears of lead pollution have affected nearby businesses, Mr. Grégoire told the lawmakers. Officials have promised compensations of up to 10,000 euros, about $ 10,800, per business.
Much of the debate over the renovation has focused on whether the damaged parts of the cathedral, mostly its roof and its 19th-century spire, should be rebuilt in the original style or be given a modern makeover.
The city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has called for the building to be restored exactly how it was before the fire. And this week the head of a group of businesses that work on historical monuments told lawmakers that there was no reason to renovate Notre-Dame differently.
"There was a wooden framework. We have all the data -- we are able to rebuild exactly as it was before, with the same material, wood, stone, lead," said the group's leader, Frédéric Letoffé.
Asked about Mr. Macron's five-year time frame, Mr. Letoffé said the cathedral might reopen by then, but added that it was "hard to say" whether the entire renovation would be completed.

Texto completo: Watch a raw comedy special on HBO, or tune into the 51st N.A.A.C.P. Awards on BET.
What's on TV
WHITMER THOMAS: THE GOLDEN ONE (2020) 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. The Los Angeles-based comedian, actor and musician Whitmer Thomas keeps audiences guessing with his unusual, deeply personal sets. Is it appropriate to laugh when he performs his goth-pop song "Partied to Death?" ("My mommy drank herself to death/and I know she tried her very best/But now I can't party because my mommy partied to death.") Such painful realizations are sprinkled throughout this new comedy special, filmed at the same Florida bar where Thomas's mother used to perform with her band. Much of the special is on the lighter side, though. Thomas riffs on his childhood in Alabama and his time in an emo rock band, and performs songs from his upcoming debut record, "Songs From the Golden One."
51ST N.A.A.C.P. IMAGE AWARDS 8 p.m. on BET. This annual awards show celebrates the work of people of color in film, television, music and literature. Netflix leads going into the show, with nominations for "Dear White People," "When They See Us" and "American Son," among others. Lizzo received six nominations, including entertainer of the year, while Beyoncé has eight, including best female artist and documentary, for "Homecoming." Anthony Anderson returns as host.
ALMOST FAMILY 8 p.m. on Fox. This drama series, based on the Australian show "Sisters," requires that you shut off your critical thinking switch for a moment. Julia (Brittany Snow) learns that she's not an only child after all when her father, a successful fertility doctor, admits he used his own genetic material to conceive dozens of children over the years. The news unites Julia with two half sisters (played by Megalyn Echikunwoke and Emily Osment), and the three find comfort in their connection. If you're wondering whether the father faces any repercussions for impregnating all those women, this two-hour season finale follows a trial brought against him in court.
THE HIDDEN KINGDOMS OF CHINA 9 p.m. on National Geographic. Michelle Yeoh ("Crazy Rich Asians") narrates this two-hour special on China's landscape and diverse wildlife. We get a glimpse of soaring mountains and tropical jungles, and meet animals like the giant panda and the Tibetan fox.
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
MS. PURPLE (2019) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. This melancholic drama from Justin Chon ("Gook") dissects the reunion of two siblings in Los Angeles's Koreatown. Kasie (Tiffany Chu), a karaoke hostess, is left reeling after her bedridden father's live-in nurse quits. With little help in sight, she reaches out to her aimless, estranged brother, Carey (Teddy Lee). Both have yet to recover from their mother's abandonment years ago. Tending to their dying father lays bare their wounds and offers them a chance to regain a sense of family. Jeannette Catsoulis named the movie a Critic's Pick in her review for The New York Times, calling it "a moody, downbeat drama soaked in color and saturated with sadness."

Texto completo: Answering your questions about our series on online child abuse.
This week's two-part investigation into the explosion of online child sexual abuse imagery drew an enormous response from listeners -- and a lot of questions. So we followed up with our guests, the investigative journalists Michael Keller and Gabriel Dance:
What has been the response to this reporting?
Shock. Generally, people -- whether it was our editors, people who read our stories, or those who listened to the "Daily" episodes -- were shocked to learn how bad the problem was.
After the initial shock, most people became angry, confused and disappointed. Many expressed frustration with the government's response and outrage at the tech companies' inability to stop the spread of the imagery. And nearly everyone said they could not believe that people would do such unspeakable acts to children.
The reporting also has spurred rigorous discussions around encryption and privacy online. It raises difficult questions about how far companies should go to protect people's privacy, especially when there are real and tragic consequences for children.
The producers and editors who worked on these episodes described it as a difficult and emotional experience. You two were immersed in this subject for months and months. How did you deal with it?
To be honest, it was hard. We had no idea how dark this story would get.
Reading hundreds of graphic descriptions of images and videos found in court cases was disturbing. Speaking with survivors of abuse was also difficult, but it was important for us to hear their stories. And we found that these conversations seemed helpful for many of them. There were times during interviews that mothers and daughters would speak with one another for long stretches, without us even asking a question.
We also spoke with dozens of people who have been working on this issue for years, particularly at children's rights organizations. One of the emotions they consistently conveyed was frustration over inaction and people turning away from the issue. And so knowing that we were drawing attention to an issue that deserved it became a major motivation for reporting on such a tough subject.
Has the reporting triggered any changes within the companies, organizations or law enforcement agencies you focused on in the episodes?
Yes. Let's start with the government.
Immediately after our stories were published, a bipartisan bill was introduced in Congress that would require tech companies to retain information on accounts found with illegal photos and videos for a longer period of time to assist law enforcement with investigations. Lawmakers say this is part of a larger package of bills they intend to introduce to address issues raised by our reporting.
Companies have responded as well. Several have said they will begin to look for the imagery more aggressively. For instance, spokespeople from Dropbox and Cloudflare said that they would implement more rigorous measures to find and remove the imagery. Others, including Yahoo, have changed their practices around video scanning. Microsoft, which we talked about a lot in these episodes, has expanded the team of employees that monitors this kind of activity and also unveiled a tool to detect adult predators trying to lure children into dangerous situations.
Then there are the advocacy groups. They've told us that our reporting has been crucial to raising awareness of an issue that they've felt has been underreported for years. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which for the first time released the number of reports filed by each company as a result of our reporting, told us that the stories have brought more attention to the issue than anything else in a decade.
A lot of listeners, moved and outraged by what they heard, have asked what they can do about the crisis of child sexual abuse imagery and how they can help victims. What's the answer?
One of the gratifying things about reporting on an issue like this is seeing the response from readers and listeners who want to help.
Foremost, it's important to educate yourself and your children regarding the perils of the internet. We wrote a bit about that here.
There are several domestic organizations working to help end this terrible epidemic, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Thorn, RAINN and the National Association to Protect Children. There are also international organizations, including the Canadian Center for Child Protection.
One survivor we spoke with on the podcast, Alicia Kozakiewicz, is working to secure funding for law enforcement teams across the nation tasked with investigating these terrible crimes.
Finally, there is always value in calling your representatives to say that this is an issue you feel is important and demands more funding or accountability.
Part 1 of the series begins with the description of a note to The Times's tip line. Has the person who sent that tip stayed in touch with you?
We haven't heard from this person. The tip came in anonymously, so there was no way for us to reach out.
The person was right to be outraged, and instead of doing nothing, acted on that outrage. For that, we are grateful.
What's the next phase of this reporting for you?
We plan to keep investigating and to stay on top of developments from the companies and lawmakers. And, of course, if anyone wants to send us tips for areas we might have missed, they can find a number of secure options at nytimes.com/tips. Thanks to all of you for listening.

A note from Nevada
To make today's episode of "The Field," about Nevada's most powerful labor union, the producers Clare Toeniskoetter and Austin Mitchell traveled to Las Vegas, where they met Jennifer Medina, a Times national correspondent.
When our team spoke with Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire, the question of who can defeat President Trump was front of mind. But for the voters whom Clare, Austin and Jenny spoke with in Nevada, the focus was on an entirely different issue: health care.
You can listen to the story here or by searching for "The Field" wherever you get your podcasts. And below, a few photos from the trip (which was both Clare and Austin's first time in Vegas).
On 'The Daily' this week
Tuesday: Alex Burns on how Michael Bloomberg has achieved his position of influence in the Democratic Party: "Bloomberg's money has become this gravitational force unlike any other in Democratic politics."
Wednesday: "People have to know about this, but nobody wants to hear about it. How do you tell that story?" In a two-part series, Michael Keller and Gabriel Dance take us through their monthslong investigation of the crisis of child sexual abuse imagery on the internet.
Thursday: "We have to explain to our daughter, this is on the internet. And she has to live with that." In Part 2, we hear from the parents of a teenager who was sexually abused as a child and whose photos have circulated online for years.
Friday: On an episode of "The Field": Why Nevada's largest labor union, which went on a six-year strike for health care, is now battling Senator Bernie Sanders over "Medicare for all."

Texto completo: "And the winner is a movie from South Korea," the president said at a rally. "What the hell was that all about?"
President Trump delivered a nationalistic cultural rant at his rally in Colorado on Thursday night, veering off script to attack the Academy Awards for giving the Best Picture Oscar to a South Korean film, "Parasite."
"How bad were the Academy Awards this year?" the president said, throwing up his hands as the crowd roared at his rally in Colorado Springs. "Did you see? And the winner is a movie from South Korea. What the hell was that all about?"
"Parasite," the acclaimed thriller by Bong Joon Ho about class tensions boiling over in a wealthy family's home, this month became the first film not in the English language to win the Academy Award for best picture in the 92-year history of the competition.
The film also won best director, original screenplay and international feature, marking a moment of pride for many Asian-Americans and a turning point in the academy's long history of embracing stories told by white filmmakers.
Mr. Trump, however, was clearly not impressed.
"We've got enough problems with South Korea, with trade," he said. "On top of it, they give them the best movie of the year? Was it good? I don't know."
Mr. Trump expressed nostalgia for Hollywood films from a bygone era.
"Let's get 'Gone With the Wind.' Can we get, like, 'Gone With the Wind' back, please?" he said, lauding the 1939 romantic saga set in the South around the Civil War, which won a host of Academy Awards, including best picture.
He also mentioned "Sunset Boulevard," the 1950 Billy Wilder film noir, which was nominated for best picture but did not win. (It won in other categories.)
"So many great movies," Mr. Trump said. "The winner is from South Korea. I thought it was best foreign film, right? Best foreign movie. No. Did this ever happen before?"
Hollywood and the Academy Awards have long been a favorite target for Republicans who decry the film industry as a bastion of liberalism. And the awards ceremony this year featured speeches by celebrities attacking Mr. Trump.
In his rally, Mr. Trump singled out for particular criticism Brad Pitt, who had referred to Mr. Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate when accepting his award this year for best supporting actor for "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood."
"They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week," Mr. Pitt said in his speech.
Firing back at his rally, Mr. Trump said he was "never a fan" of Mr. Pitt and added that the actor "got up and said a little wiseguy statement."
"He's a little wiseguy," Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump's attack on "Parasite" prompted a response from the Democratic National Committee.
"Parasite is a foreign movie about how oblivious the ultrarich are about the struggles of the working class, and it requires two hours of reading subtitles," the committee wrote on Twitter. "Of course Trump hates it."
Neon, the independent film distributor behind "Parasite," also responded to Mr. Trump's broadside with an acid reference to the movie's English subtitles.
"Understandable," the company wrote on Twitter. "He can't read."

Site Leaders Asked to Sign Confidentiality Agreements

Texto completo: A day before the caucuses, the state party says volunteer and staff members at caucus sites are forbidden to talk to the news media.
LAS VEGAS -- One day before the Nevada caucuses, the state Democratic Party has asked all caucus site leaders to sign a nondisclosure agreement preventing them from talking to the news media. State party officials began to present the agreements to site leaders Friday.
Nevada State Democratic Party officials said it was standard procedure to make such requests, because paid and volunteer caucus site leaders are often given information about the party's strategy and methodology. The existence of the agreement was first reported by CNN on Friday.
The agreement specifically bars volunteers and staff members working the caucuses from talking to the news media, even if they are unnamed.
"If I am a volunteer and answering phones at the N.S.D.P. office or volunteering at an official N.S.D.P. event, I am a representative of the N.S.D.P. and am not authorized to speak to the press unless given permission by the executive director or communications director," the agreement says.
It goes on to specify in all caps that "THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS."
On another front, Nevada Democrats, in a move to bolster the presidential caucuses and avoid Iowa-style chaos, said Friday that they would not rely on a Google form for reporting results and would instead use a traditional phone-based system -- the way results had been reported for decades in caucus states.
Precinct leaders will report results from Saturday's caucuses to the state party through a dedicated phone hotline and by text message, rather than relying on a Google application intended to help volunteers and officials calculate delegates, according to a memo the state party circulated to the presidential campaigns.
The memo, from Alana Mounce, the state party's executive director, made no mention of the Google Forms tool that volunteers have been instructed to use to calculate and input results. Instead, it informed the campaigns to expect caucus results to be transmitted through the state party's telephone hotline by precinct leaders reading from caucus work sheets they have completed by hand.
"The hotline report will be the primary source of the precinct caucus results reported on Caucus Day," Ms. Mounce wrote.
The move to a phone-based reporting system follows widespread concern about the caucus process after a meltdown in Iowa earlier this month. But even relying on a phone hotline is not foolproof: In Iowa, some caucus chairs waited on hold for hours while trying to report results, and operators were flooded with nuisance calls after the phone number was leaked online.
The 2020 caucus process is far more complex than it has been before; Democratic National Committee rules put in place for this presidential cycle require reporting two sets of raw vote totals for each candidate in addition to the delegate figures, and Nevadans were able to cast their ballots early for the first time.
A Nevada Democratic official said the party and its volunteer precinct leaders would still use the Google application to calculate results and commingle early-vote and in-person caucus totals. But the results the party plans to publicly report Saturday, the official said, will come from the numbers sent by phone and text message from the state's 2,097 precincts.
"After their precinct caucuses conclude, the precinct chairs will call a hotline to securely report their results to a trained operator, will submit via text a photo of their caucus reporting sheet to state party staff through an established MMS reporting hub, and then they will return their caucus reporting sheet and other materials to their Site Lead," Ms. Mounce wrote.
Nevada Democratic officials had long planned to report caucus results via a smartphone app build by Shadow Inc., but abandoned those plans when Shadow was part of the high-profile chaos in Iowa that led to days of delays before full results were known.
The Nevada state party then announced it would report results through the Google Forms tool. Technology experts from Google, the Democratic National Committee and DigiDems, the incubator of technology talent for Democratic campaigns, are in Las Vegas to help support the Nevada caucuses.
Over the last week the state party has held several training sessions for volunteers who are overseeing the caucuses. The precinct leaders have been told how to use and operate iPads and given instructions on how to tabulate and enter their caucus results into the Google Forms application.
The state party's memo does not stipulate what time to expect public reporting of caucus results. Democratic officials in Nevada, scarred by the experience in Iowa, have been quietly playing down expectations about how long it will take to know who won the state.
"The Caucus Day results will be posted on a public reporting website hosted by NV Dems with periodic updates," Ms. Mounce wrote.
Among the biggest challenges for state party officials is tabulating results from nearly 75,000 ballots cast during the four-day early voting period and transmitting them to state party-owned iPads that will be used by volunteer precinct leaders.
The precinct leaders will then be responsible for combining the early-vote data with preferences of in-person participants on Saturday to determine which candidates meet viability thresholds to win delegates.
Viability thresholds vary by precinct, but most are about 15 percent.
One variable that is not known is how many people will show up to caucus in person Saturday. About 118,000 Democrats participated in the 2008 Nevada caucuses, a number that dropped to 84,000 in 2016.
With so many ballots already cast early, a relatively low in-person caucus turnout could allow the day to run relatively smoothly. A large caucus day turnout would make everything take longer on Saturday.
In Iowa, the caucuses were marred by mathematical errors from precinct leaders overwhelmed by the amount of data they were required to document.
In Nevada, the results reported on Saturday will reflect what is recorded on the caucus work sheets precinct leaders are to fill out. If the math is wrong, Ms. Mounce wrote, the state party will address it in subsequent days.
"If there are any math questions or other issues on caucus reporting sheets, they will be addressed subsequent to caucus day," she wrote.

Caucuses in More Diverse Nevada Could Be a Preview of What's to Come

Texto completo: The state's contest will be the first this presidential cycle in which the racial makeup comes close to reflecting the nation's population as a whole.
The Nevada caucuses on Saturday will be the first contest of the Democratic presidential race with a racial makeup that (very roughly) reflects the population of the nation as a whole.
So while the actual delegate haul is rather small, the results could be read as a preview of what's to come in the weeks and months ahead.
Senator Bernie Sanders is favored to win the caucuses -- buoyed by his support among young people, Latinos and very liberal voters, a coalition that he hopes will carry him to success across the country.
A Las Vegas Review-Journal/AARP Nevada poll conducted last week found Mr. Sanders in the lead with 25 percent of the vote, including about three-fifths of voters under 30 and a third of those identifying as very liberal.
Separate surveys focused on Latinos have shown that Mr. Sanders has support from roughly a third of Hispanic caucusgoers. A Univision News poll of registered Latino voters put him at 33 percent, while a Telemundo poll -- which focused only on those deemed likely to caucus -- gave him 31 percent support. The Telemundo survey put him in a statistical tie with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who pulled 34 percent support.
According to entrance polls, Latinos made up about one in five voters in the 2016 Democratic caucuses, which Mr. Sanders narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton. That is a slightly higher share than they are expected to comprise in the rest of the country, but not by much.
The Review-Journal/AARP poll found Mr. Biden in second place with 18 percent support, and a flock of lower-tier candidates in a statistical tie for third place. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer, Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., all had 10 to 13 percent each. If those results bear out on Saturday, it is possible that none of these candidates will feel compelled to end their campaigns any time soon.
With Mr. Sanders consolidating the support of his base nationwide and slowly building upon it, maintaining a large and divided field of more moderate candidates through at least Super Tuesday on March 3 could play to his advantage. That is particularly true because in most states and districts, candidates need to receive at least 15 percent of the vote in order to be awarded delegates at the Democratic National Convention.
"If Sanders wins here by a large margin, I think he has a chance to win South Carolina and be in a very strong position going into Super Tuesday," Jon Ralston, the editor of The Nevada Independent, said in an interview, referring to the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29. "But if he does not, if there's an upset or if Joe Biden finishes a strong second and stories are written about how he's the comeback kid, that could change everything."
The Democratic candidates sparred in a fiery debate on Wednesday in Las Vegas, but it may not have much impact on the state's results. That's partly because the focus of the night fell most heavily on Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, who came under merciless attack from all five of his onstage rivals -- but who is not competing in the Nevada caucuses.
Besides, the early-voting period, which ran from Saturday through Tuesday, was already over by the time the candidates debated. According to the Review Journal/AARP poll -- taken just before early voting began -- roughly three in five Nevadans planned to vote in that window, rather than on caucus day. And sure enough, the Nevada Democratic Party has reported high early turnout (this was the first time Nevada has offered early voting). Officials estimate that roughly 75,000 people participated; that's nearly equal to the total number of Nevada caucusgoers in 2016.
The party said that about half of those early voters were first-time caucusgoers, according to CNN -- a possible boon to Mr. Sanders, who outperformed his rivals among first-time caucusgoers and voters in the Iowa and New Hampshire contests, according to entrance and exit polls.
It is possible that the results of Nevada's caucuses won't be the main headline on Saturday night: That could end up being the caucus process itself, in the event of a fiasco similar to what occurred in Iowa. There were lines and delays at many early-voting sites; the iPad system that was set up to try to avert an Iowa-like disaster proved slightly cumbersome, according to some reports, though no major hiccups have been reported.
It remains to be seen whether the caucuses will go off without a hitch, or if final results will prove elusive -- as they still are in Iowa.
"If there's a huge turnout on caucus day, and it's 50,000 or 70,000 or 80,000 people, I'm not betting on anything," Mr. Ralston said.
In the Review Journal/AARP poll, two-thirds of likely Democratic caucusgoers said they were ready to ditch the caucus process in favor of a more straightforward primary.

Texto completo: Conde Nast, the publishing giant behind Vogue, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, said Friday that it would no longer use nondisclosure agreements for matters involving harassment and discrimination.
Stan Duncan, the company's chief people officer, laid out Conde Nast's new stance in a memo to employees that was shared with The New York Times.
"There are legitimate arguments in favor of NDAs in certain circumstances, which is why their use remains widespread - confidential settlements can spare both employees and employers the cost of litigation, and maintain privacy for all involved," Duncan wrote. "However, given our company's values and commitment to transparency, we have decided that going forward, we will no longer enter into NDAs that prevent an employee from making a disclosure of conduct they were subjected to that they believe, in good faith, constitutes harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. We also expect to release existing NDAs in these matters."
The executive added that the company would release people from existing nondisclosure agreements related to those matters on a case-by-case basis.
The use of nondisclosure agreements across many companies for complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination has become a flash point in the wake of the #MeToo movement. The New Yorker has been at the forefront of the discussion: The magazine won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for Ronan Farrow's investigation into decades of allegations of sexual misconduct by film producer Harvey Weinstein, which involved the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence his accusers.
Weinstein is currently on trial, accused of rape, in New York.
The News Guild of New York, which represents employees at the Conde Nast publications The New Yorker, Pitchfork and Ars Technica, said in a statement Friday that its members applauded the announcement.
"NDAs represent a harmful practice that prevents journalists from holding accountable those who abuse their power - eroding a fundamental principle of journalism," the statement said.

Texto completo: President Trump has directly weighed in on the White House review of a forthcoming book by his former national security adviser, telling his staff that he views John Bolton as 'a traitor,' that everything he uttered to the departed aide about national security is classified and that he will seek to block the book's publication, according to two people familiar with the conversations.
The president's private arguments stand in contrast to the point-by-point process used to classify and protect sensitive secrets and appears to differ from the White House's public posture toward Bolton's much-anticipated memoir. The National Security Council warned Bolton last month that his draft 'appears to contain significant amounts of classified information,' some of it top secret, but pledged to help him revise the manuscript and 'move forward as expeditiously as possible.'
'We will do our best to work with you to ensure your client's ability to tell his story in a manner that protects U.S. national security,' Ellen Knight, senior director of the council's records office, wrote in a Jan. 23 letter to Bolton's attorney.
But the president has insisted to aides that Bolton's account of his work in Trump's White House, 'The Room Where It Happened,' should not see the light of day before the November election, according to the two people familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations.
Trump has told his lawyers that Bolton should not be allowed to publish any of his interactions with him about national security because they are privileged and classified, these people said. He has also repeatedly brought up the book with his team, asking whether Bolton is going to be able to publish it, they said.
Trump told national television anchors on Feb. 4 during an off-the-record lunch that material in the book was 'highly classified,' according to notes from one participant in the luncheon. He then called him a 'traitor.'
'We're going to try and block the publication of the book,' Trump said, according to the notes. 'After I leave office, he can do this. But not in the White House.'
'I give the guy a break. I give him a job. And then he turns on me,' Trump added during the West Wing lunch. 'He's just making things up.'
Bolton's book has promised to unveil key first-person moments between Bolton and Trump that were at the heart of the president's handling of Ukraine, a saga that led to his impeachment by the House.
In a recent appearance at Vanderbilt University, former Obama national security adviser Susan E. Rice attacked Bolton for failing to testify in the impeachment hearings and said she 'couldn't imagine' withholding critical information from the American people to preserve it for a book. Bolton insisted his testimony would not have changed the Senate's impeachment acquittal.
As the Senate launched a trial in late January on the House's charges that Trump abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress, the New York Times reported it had learned a key detail alleged by Bolton in his manuscript: that Trump told him he was conditioning the release of military aid to Ukraine on whether its government would help investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.
Trump responded to that story on Jan. 27 by tweeting that he 'NEVER told John Bolton that aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into the Bidens or Democrats.'
Democrats demanded that Bolton be summoned to testify in the Senate trial, but Republicans rejected those calls.
A person close to Bolton said he has grown concerned in recent weeks that the White House has appeared to claim that broad categories of topics are classified, without clearly identifying or articulating the reasons for that level of protection. A separate person close to Bolton said the team anticipates the possibility of a long legal battle over the issue.
Bolton's lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, declined to comment Friday on the claim of classified material and the president's pledge to block the book's release.
'The NSC's pre-publication review of Ambassador Bolton's manuscript is proceeding,' Cooper said. 'Ambassador Bolton is continuing to pursue it in good faith. We have nothing to say beyond that.'
In many ways, Bolton remains a captive of the White House review process. He has earned a reported seven-figure advance for his account from publisher Simon - Schuster, which has planned to release the book on March 17.
But Bolton would take a huge legal risk " including the possibility of a criminal investigation " if he published his manuscript without the National Security Council's final approval.
There is precedent to give Bolton and his lawyers reason to pause. A former Navy SEAL wrote a 2012 book about his role in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, triggering a Justice Department criminal investigation into allegations he published classified details of his work and training as a special operator.
In a 2016 settlement, Matt Bissonnette, who wrote 'No Easy Day' under the pen name Mark Owen, agreed to turn over to the government all the profits and future royalties stemming from his book " which amounted to at least $6.6-million at the time. As part of the deal, Bissonnette acknowledged he failed to get his manuscript properly cleared by the Pentagon. In exchange, the Justice Department agreed to dismiss any other claims and drop any plans to prosecute him for the release of classified information.
Robert Luskin, the lawyer who represented Bissonnette after he came under investigation, said Bolton can challenge the White House review but it is unclear how he might fare.
'The challenge for Bolton is that the president has pretty broad power to classify or declassify; but once the manuscript has actually been submitted for review, Bolton would have the right to challenge undue delay or purely capricious or vindictive exercises of the government's authority to review and require changes,' Luskin said. 'He could get judicial review, but the process would not be fast and the rules not especially clear. '

Texto completo: Post-impeachment purge of appointees deemed to lack fealty to president
President Trump has instructed his White House to identify and force out officials across his administration who are not seen-as sufficiently loyal, a post-impeachment escalation that administration officials say reflects a new phase of a campaign of retribution and restructuring ahead of the November election.
Johnny McEntee, Trump's former personal aide who now leads the effort as director of presidential personnel, has begun combing through various agencies with a mandate from the president to oust or sideline political appointees who have not proved their loyalty, according to several administration officials and others familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
The push comes in the aftermath of an impeachment process in which several members of Trump's administration provided damning testimony about his behavior with regard to Ukraine. The stream of officials publicly criticizing Trump's actions frustrated the president and caused him to fixate on cleaning house after his acquittal this month.
'We want bad people out of our government!' Trump tweeted Feb. 13, kicking off a tumultuous stretch of firings, resignations, controversial appointments and private skirmishes that have since spilled into public view.
The National Security Council, the State Department and the Justice Department are targets of particular focus, according to two administration officials, and-there have recently been multiple resignations and reassignments at each of those agencies.
John C. Rood, the official in charge of Defense Department policy who had certified that Ukraine had met anti-corruption obligations, was let go this week. Victoria Coates, the deputy national security adviser who was viewed with suspicion by some White House aides, was removed from her post and was moved to an advisory position in the Energy Department.
McEntee spent part of this week asking officials in various Cabinet agencies to provide names of political appointees working in government who are not fully supportive of Trump's presidency, according to administration officials.
The president instructed McEntee to find people in the administration who aren't aligned with Trump and 'get rid' of them, according to someone familiar with the president's directive.
Trump did not provide additional specificity on what exactly he wanted beyond a workforce that more fully reflects his instincts, the person said, and it is-unclear what criteria are being-used to determine an official's fealty to the president. McEntee's discussions with Cabinet agencies were first reported by Axios.
The 29-year-old former campaign aide is planning to prepare a presentation for Trump about what he has found. While Sean Doocey, the former director of presidential personnel, reported to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's deputy, McEntee reports directly to the president, according to a senior administration official.
What began as a campaign of retribution against officials who participated in the impeachment process has evolved into a full-scale effort to create an administration more fully in sync with Trump's id and agenda, according to several officials familiar with the plan. It is unclear whether civil servants will be targeted as well, but it would be harder to dislodge them than removing political appointees. Civil servants, however, could be sidelined in other ways.
As he became the third president in American history to be impeached, Trump seethed against his own appointees who defied White House lawyers to comply with congressional subpoenas and testify about his conduct. The process clarified for Trump and his top advisers that they had not focused enough on personnel in the early part of the presidency, creating a loyalty deficiency the president is moving quickly to correct, officials said.
The burgeoning effort was reflected in Trump's decision this week to appoint Richard Grenell as the next acting director of national intelligence, placing a fiercely loyal but inexperienced ally atop an intelligence structure against which the president has frequently railed.
Mulvaney used a speech this week at the Oxford Union in Britain to inveigh against the 'deep state,' and he lamented that the administration could not fire more agency employees who do not implement the president's orders. He referred to some of testimony of the witnesses who participated in Trump's impeachment inquiry.
Bureaucrats who want to make policy instead of implementing it 'should put their name on the effing ballot and run' for office, he said during remarks to a group of several hundred people, according to audio of a speech obtained by The Washington Post.
Trump's family members have been among the main champions of the effort to force out officials who have not proved their devotion to Trump.
Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior adviser in the White House, has played a central role in the push, concentrating more power in the West Wing and working to combat leaks, officials said.
Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter that the impeachment investigation was helpful in 'unearthing who all needed to be fired.'
Cliff Sims, a former White House adviser who wrote a book titled 'Team of Vipers,' about his time in the White House, has said Trump's presidency has been repeatedly undermined by disloyal underlings.
'Loyalist shouldn't be a dirty word,' he said. 'Loyalty to the duly elected president and his agenda is exactly what we should expect from our unelected appointees.'
Brendan Buck, a longtime adviser to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said that while Trump is entitled to have political appointees who support his agenda, the purity tests could make it difficult to find qualified people.
'If they also insist on hiring only people who've never taken issue with something the president has done, it's going to be slim pickings,' he said.
Trump selected Grenell, the-ambassador to Germany, to-lead the intelligence community in place of Joseph Maguire after becoming angry last week-when he learned that a U.S.-intelligence official had told-lawmakers that Russia wants to see him reelected, according to people familiar with the matter.
Grenell has moved quickly to concentrate power within the intelligence agencies. Maguire's deputy, Andrew P. Hallman, resigned Friday. Grenell hired Kash Patel, a National Security Council aide who has worked in the past to cast doubt on the FBI's investigation into Russian election interference. Grenell has requested access to information from the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, the New York Times reported, citing two-people familiar with the matter.
The moves reflect the skeptical view the president has had of-the intelligence community after his campaign's links to Russia were investigated and several of his associates were prosecuted.
The anger extends beyond the intelligence agencies, and Trump has also called for law enforcement officials who investigated his campaign to be investigated or prosecuted. Even some Trump allies are feeling heat over not being aggressive enough about taking on the president's perceived enemies.
At a donor roundtable Tuesday at the Montage Hotel in Los Angeles, one participant pointedly questioned Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) on why he was not holding accountable people who were responsible for the Russia investigation.
'I see you on Fox News every night, and then you do nothing about it. What are you going to do about it?' the donor asked, according to an attendee.
'What a fantastic question!' Trump said.
Meanwhile, administration officials are conducting a search for the 'Anonymous' author of a tell-all book about Trump titled 'A Warning,' according to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who told CNN on Friday that the search had become a 'vocation with everybody.'
McEntee, who lost his job in 2018 over concerns about his online gambling, has long expressed an interest in the personnel office despite having no previous government experience, two administration officials said. Within the West Wing, he is seen as fiercely devoted to the president and is well liked by first lady Melania Trump, the officials said.
Some within the White House have bristled at his lack of experience and aggressive approach to ferreting out 'Never Trumpers.'
McEntee 'does not have the relevant experience to do this job, unless the job is to purge Never Trumpers and reward loyalists,' one official said.
Another senior administration official countered that McEntee was talented and up to the task, with the key qualification of having the president's confidence.
As he gears up for the reelection contest, Trump has moved to surround himself with longtime allies who have proved their devotion to him while pushing away those who have not earned his trust.
This month, Trump rehired Hope Hicks, one of his longest-serving aides and closest confidants.
During a podcast interview last week, Trump concurred when Fox News analyst Geraldo Rivera described the White House as 'a nest of vipers and snitches and backstabbers and rats.'
'I inherited a place with, you know, many different administrations, and they worked there for years and were civil service and with unions and all of it,' he said on Rivera's 'Roadkill' podcast. 'You can't do what you'd like to do.'

Prominent Virginia church seeks to explain Anglican rector's sudden exit

Texto completo: There are competing explanations for why Tory Baucum abruptly resigned his position as the leader of the prominent Truro Anglican Church in November and has agreed not to set foot on the property since.
Baucum says that after years as an Anglican pastor, he made the decision to resign his clerical credentials and convert to Catholicism. Any tensions between him and the staff at the church in the Northern Virginia city of Fairfax, he says, were because of his 'passion' for the theology of the late Catholic Pope John Paul-II.
Church leaders say those tensions arose from causes that have little to do with Baucum's theology. His behavior in the workplace, the leaders wrote in a summary of an investigative report, was 'abusive,' 'intimidating,' 'coarse,' 'vulgar' and 'unpredictable.'
Leaders of the congregation of more than 1,200 members held a meeting at the church this week to try to explain the results of a professional investigation into Baucum's conduct. They read the summary and took questions from church members, but they did not make the investigator's report public.
The meeting, which packed the historic sanctuary, left many members confused and concerned.
Truro helped lead an exodus of 15 Virginia churches from the Episcopal denomination in 2006, in protest of the denomination's acceptance of homosexuality, especially its appointment of a gay bishop. The church was one of the most prominent in the United States to leave over the issue. The next year, Baucum took over as rector " an Anglican term for head pastor " as Truro was facing the legal ramifications of its exit from the denomination.
Under Baucum, the church fought for ownership of its building. The Episcopal Church argued that it owned the property and won the battle in court. But while nearby Falls Church Anglican, which also left the denomination, was eventually forced to give up its historic building, Baucum worked out a long-term agreement with the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia to allow Truro to use its former property rent-free.
Baucum's friendship with the leader of the diocese, Bishop Shannon Johnston, garnered a glowing New York Times profile and praise from the Archbishop of Canterbury. But some saw him as too close to the denomination. Top Anglican bishops condemned him for trying to open a 'school of peace and reconciliation' along with the diocese. 'The decision . . . is not in harmony with the Bible's instruction in dealing with false teachers,' Archbishop Foley Beach wrote in an open letter.
In Baucum's church, he was praised. A word that he used frequently, and that congregants often echoed in describing him, is 'peacemaker.'
'Tory's gifts and leadership have not only allowed Truro to survive the past tumultuous decade, but to thrive,' senior warden Phil Dame said at the church meeting on Sunday.
But behind closed doors, staff members say, Baucum was anything but peaceful. They described a boss prone to bursts of fury, who had no tolerance for disagreement.
In November, a group of leaders wrote a letter to the vestry " which acts like a board of directors " and to their bishop, describing a work environment that they said had terrorized them. Baucum 'had created a culture where the staff felt they could not question or even speak with him about his decisions. This led to an environment where the staff became increasingly fearful,' Dame said, describing the letter, which the church has declined to make public.
Dame and the Rev. Tim Mayfield, a pastor on staff who did not sign the letter, met with Baucum in November and told him about the staff's allegations. 'Tory's perception of his relationship with the staff was entirely different from the perception set forth in the letter,' Dame said.
Very soon after that meeting, Dame said, Baucum announced he would resign and convert to Catholicism.
In an email to The Washington Post, Baucum disputed that timeline. He said that he had informed Anglican higher-ups of his intention to resign his ministry and convert before he knew of the staff letter. Johnston, the retired Episcopal bishop, says he was in England meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury at the same time as Baucum, and he believes Baucum had already announced his intent to resign before he learned about the staff complaints.
'He had been speaking about the fact that he knew his time at Truro was coming closer and closer to an end, long before any controversy broke out. It didn't grow out of his sense that things were going wrong. . . . I know he felt that he was getting closer and closer in his heart and mind to the Catholic Church,' Johnston said. 'His journey into Roman Catholicism was not born out of vocational crisis or disagreement or any kind of discipline that was threatened for him. . . . It's a very unfortunate coincidence that causes people to misunderstand and misconstrue what is true and what's not true about what's going on right now.'
Anglicanism was born when England's King Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church and has retained some of the organizational structures and liturgical practices of Catholicism for centuries. But the Church of England and its global cousins have updated their doctrine to deviate from the Catholic Church on many issues, such as whether priests can marry. (Anglican priests can, and Baucum's wife, Elizabeth, was a leader in the Truro community.)
The investigator hired by Truro interviewed 18 staff members and concluded in late January that the explosive letter was essentially accurate in its description of Baucum's conduct, according to a statement from the vestry. Church members, not just staff, complained about similar behavior from Baucum, but the investigation didn't deal with that in detail, vestry members said.
Baucum said in his email: 'There was some relational breakdown and I am sure I contributed to that. But over 12 years of ministry at Truro my leadership has not been characterized by anger though I have exhibited anger at times. I regret any hurt that has caused.'
The former pastor, who is on paid leave through the end of the month, did not attend Sunday's meeting. But junior warden Ken Schutz read a statement from him. 'My enthusiasm for John Paul II's theology has not been shared by all staff,' the statement said, and he 'learned through the review process that my passion was sometimes experienced as anger, which I am responsible for and regret.'
Multiple church members responded to the statement by asking what Baucum's theological beliefs are. Jim Robb, a member of the vestry, answered that church leaders didn't discuss that with Baucum. A member in the back muttered loudly, 'For crying out loud, that's at the core of the problem. Why didn't you ask?'
Asked whether Baucum's behavior or his Catholic theology led to the staff letter, Robb answered immediately: 'Behavior.'
Mayfield, who has been serving as interim rector since Baucum's departure, is likely to stay in that role 'for a while,' a vestry member announced, drawing significant applause from church members.
At the church meeting, Mayfield spoke only briefly, offering an opening prayer. 'Our enemy isn't one another. Our enemy is the devil,' Mayfield said. 'In our disagreement, in our pain, as we seek the truth in this situation, we're asking that you were to deliver us from every evil influence.'
Vestry members said they are still negotiating Baucum's severance package.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Donald Trump reelected, five people familiar with the matter said, a disclosure to Congress that angered Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.
The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant.
During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Trump's allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that Trump has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans.
That intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced Wednesday that he was replacing Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter.
Though some current and former officials speculated that the briefing may have played a role in the removal of Maguire, who had told people in recent days that he believed he would remain in the job, two administration officials said the timing was coincidental. Grenell had been in discussions with the administration about taking on new roles, they said, and Trump had never felt a kinship with Maguire.
Spokeswomen for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and its election security office declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A Democratic House intelligence committee official called the Feb. 13 briefing an important update about "the integrity of our upcoming elections" and said that members of both parties attended, including Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee.
Trump has long accused the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's 2016 interference as the work of a "deep-state" conspiracy intent on undermining the validity of his election. Intelligence officials feel burned by their experience after the last election, where their work became subject of intense political debate and is now a focus of a Justice Department investigation.
Part of the president's anger over the intelligence briefing stemmed from the administration's reluctance to provide sensitive information to Schiff. He has been a leading critic of Trump since 2016, doggedly investigating Russian election interference and later leading the impeachment inquiry into the president's dealings with Ukraine.
After asking about the briefing that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other agencies gave to the House, Trump complained that Schiff would "weaponize" the intelligence about Russia's support for him, according to a person familiar with the briefing. And he was angry that no one had told him sooner about the briefing, the person said.
Trump did not erupt at Maguire, and instead just asked pointed questions, according to the person. But the message was unmistakable: He was displeased by what took place.
Pierson, officials said, was delivering the conclusion of multiple intelligence agencies, not her own opinion.
The intelligence community issued an assessment in early 2017 that President Vladimir Putin personally ordered an influence campaign in the previous year's election and developed "a clear preference for President-elect Trump." But Republicans have long argued that Moscow's campaign was designed to sow chaos, not aid Trump specifically.
And some Republicans have accused the intelligence agencies of opposing Trump, but intelligence officials reject those allegations. They fiercely guard their work as nonpartisan, saying it is the only way to ensure its validity.
Though intelligence officials have previously informed lawmakers that Russia's interference campaign was ongoing, last week's briefing did contain what appeared to be new information, including that Russia intends to interfere with the ongoing Democratic primaries as well as the general election.
Christopher A. Wray, the FBI director, was asked during a congressional hearing this month whether the bureau saw an effort by Russia to aid or harm any particular campaign. He declined to answer in public, but said generally that "the efforts to sow divisiveness and discord on both sides of an issue and to generate controversy and to generate distrust in our democratic and our electoral process that's very much ongoing."
Both Republicans and Democrats asked the intelligence agencies to hand over the underlying material that prompted their conclusion that Russia again is favoring Trump's election.
How soon the House committee might get that information is not clear. Since the impeachment inquiry, tensions have risen between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the committee. As officials navigate the disputes, the intelligence agencies have slowed the amount of material they provide to the House, officials said. The agencies are required by law to regularly brief Congress on threats.
While Republicans have long been critical of the Obama administration for not doing enough to track and deter Russian interference in 2016, current and former intelligence officials said the party is at risk of making a similar mistake now. Trump has been reluctant to even hear about election interference, and Republicans dislike discussing it publicly.
The aftermath of last week's briefing prompted some intelligence officials to voice concerns that the White House will dismantle a key election security effort by Dan Coats, the former director of national intelligence: the establishment of an election interference czar. Pierson has held the post since last summer.
And some current and former intelligence officials expressed fears that Grenell may have been put in place explicitly to slow the pace of information on election interference to Congress. The revelations about Trump's confrontation with Maguire raised new concerns about Grenell's appointment, said the Democratic House committee official, who added that the upcoming election could be more vulnerable to foreign interference.

Texto completo: ATLANTA - Most Americans mistakenly believe the 2020 census will ask whether they are citizens, though the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration from including that question in the decennial count, according to a survey released Thursday by the Pew Research Center.
A majority of those surveyed - 56% - believe the question is on the census; 25% are unsure; and only 17% said a citizenship question is not on the census.
Those findings come as Atlanta-area leaders are scrambling to clear up misunderstandings about the constitutionally mandated census and encourage participation.
The Trump administration argued introducing the citizenship question would help it better track demographics and enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Critics said including it could deter many unauthorized immigrants from participating, though the U.S. Census Bureau says it does not share participants' legal status with federal immigration authorities.
Invitations to respond to the 2020 Census online by phone or mail will go out between March 12-20. There is a lot at stake for metro Atlanta: The census helps determine the number of seats each s:ate has in the U.S. House of Representatives, how state legislative districts are drawn and where the government should distribute hundreds of billions in federal funds each year.
For the results, Pew - a nonpartisan research center - surveyed 3,535 Lr.S. adults online in English and Spanish in January. The survey participants are members of an enline survey panel recruited through random sampling of residential addresses and phone numbers. Other findings:
Nearly 8 in 10 said they cefinitely or probably will submit a census form.
? Younger people are less likely to participate than older people.
* Blacks and Hispanice are less likely to fill out census forms than whites.
? More than a quarter of those surveyed mistakenly believe the census will ask about their religion, while 47% are unsure.
* Only about 1 in 5 know they can fill out the census online this year.

Texto completo: HANAU, Germany - A German gunman driven by racism and conspiracy theories opened fire on two bars frequented by immigrants late Wednesday, killing nine people and shocking a nation where violent crimes targeting minorities have spiked against the backdrop of a resurgent far right.
Politicians scrambled to express their sorrow and horror at the attack, which security officials said on Thursday was carried out by a 43-year-old German who appeared to have been driven by ethnic hatred.
The shooting in Hanau, 15 miles east of Frankfurt, was the most violent in a growing string of attacks targeting ethnic minorities, or Germans who openly support them, in a country roiled by bitter debates over immigration in recent years. All nine of those killed had immigrant backgrounds, Peter Frank, Germany's federal prosecutor, said.
"Everything is being done to clarify the background of these horrible murders to the last detail," Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Berlin. "But at present there is much evidence that the perpetrator acted out of rightwing extremist, racist motives. Out of hatred against people of other origins, other beliefs or other outward appearances."
"Racism is a poison," Merkel said. "Hatred is a poison."
The suspect and his mother, neither of whom were officially identified, were both found shot dead in his home early Thursday, said Peter Beuth, the interior minister for the central state ofHesse.
Germany has some of the world's strictest gun laws and last year moved to tighten them further, including requiring background checks, after a spike in shootings by right-wing extremists in the past year.
Local authorities in Hanau said the gunman had been in possession of a valid gun license for marksmanship. The license was issued to Tobias Rathjen, said ar official from Main-Kinzig, the district that includes Hanau.
Terrorism experts and several German ir edia outlets identified the shooter as Tobias R., v/hose photos matched the images of a man who posted a nearly 2-minute screed on the YouTube page of a Tobi as Rathjen, which has since been taker, down.
Speaking in accented English, he addressed Americans, citing various conspiracy theories and calling on them to "F.ght now."
"On the nome page of the suspected attacker were posted video messages and a sort of manifesto that, in addition to con fused thoughts and abstruse conspiracy theories, displayed deeply racist convictions," Frank said.
This larest shooting adds to an expanding number of far-r ,ght attacks in a political environment that has grown mere aggressive, especially since the Alternative foi Germany party became the first far-right party to enter Germany's national Parliament since World War II.
In June, a conservative politician whose name had appeared on a neo-Nazi hit list circulated online was fatally shot in the head in what officials believe was the country's first far-right political assassination since the Naz. era.
Less than six months later, a rightwing gunman killed two Germans - a passer-by and a cusiomer at a kebab shop - after a failed attempt to storm a synagogue in Halle on Yom Kippur.
Last week, authorities bioke up a suspected fat-right terrorist network, arresting 12 people, including a member of the police force.
In the past three decades, the German population has grown increasingly diverse, leading to bitter dispute over who qualifies as German and v/ho is still considered a "foreigner" in a country where roughly a quarter of the nearly 82 million inhabitants are immigrants or descendants of immigrants.
That debate oecame aspecially inflamed after Merkel's decision in 2015 to open Germany's borders to more than 1 million asylum-seekers, many from wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Kemal Kocák, a cashier at a convenience store next to the Arena Cafe & Bar, the second to be attacked, said that he had arrived at the scene soon after the shootings and found a "catastrophe."
"Afghani, Bosnian, Pole two Turks, a Roma," said Kocák, who said he had known virtually all of the victims.
Both of the bars attacked, the Midnight and the Arena, were popular with young people from the city's tight-knit Kurdish and Turkish communities. Turkish officials said that five of the victims were citizens of Turkey.
One young man who spake in Turkish from his hospital bed :o TRT television said that he had been in a group of about a dozer friends whe had just ordered, when they heard several shots ring out.
"Than I saw the man coming inside," said the victim, identifier only as Muhammed B. "He came to the other side and killed them all. Then he came to our side and shot anyone he saw from the head."

SOONER OR LATER Zoe Kravitz WAS GOING TO BE A STAR

Texto completo: One afternoon in January, Zoe Kravitz was sitting in a sushi restaurant on the second floor of a Los Angeles strip mall, but her thoughts were 3,000 miles and 10 or so years away.
Specifically, she was thinking about her weed guy.
He'd come around with product concealed in a guitar case. "He would only talk in code," Kravitz remembered. "Like, 'Do you want a guitar lesson today?' But then sometimes he would screw it up, and be like, 'Do you want guitar?' I'm like, This isn't code anymore."
She was in her early 20s then, working only on and off, just another smart, young Brooklynite with time on her hands and a propensity for overthinking. She couldn't have known it, but she was also doing research for her first headlining role, in the Hulu series "High Fidelity," based on the 1995 lad-lit novel by Nick Hornby. Kravitz plays a Brooklyn record store owner whose life - and love life - is going nowhere particular, a part for which all those guitar lessons were inadvertent research.
"I did a lot of dumb stuff," she said, but used a more pungent noun than "stuff."
"Fun stuff," she said, "but dumb stuff. And was probably a really difficult person to be in a relationship with. But I think maybe any 21, 22, 23-year-old is."
It feels like Kravitz, 31, has always been famous - an indelible screen presence and iconic parents will do that - but for years she's been on the fringes of the action, playing haunted supporting characters in epics like "Mad Max: Fury Road" and the "Divergent" series. But that's about to change. She recently left for London to start shooting her biggest movie role to date, playing Selina Kyle - better known as Catwoman - in director Matt Reeves' rįThe Batman." Robert Pattinson plays the Caped Crusader, Colin Farrell is the Penguin, and in true starof-a-comic-book-adaptation fashion, Kravitz said she couldn't say much else, except that she never imagined finding herself central to a nøovie like this one.
"I really thought I was going to do theater and indie films," she said. "That was what I liked growing up. And also, that was what I thought I was suited for. I didn't see a lot of people who looked like me in big movies."
Just a few years ago, Kravitz - whose parents, actress Lisa Bonet and rocker/scarf influencer Lenny Kravitz, are both African American and Jewish - had been discouraged from auditioning for a part in one of Christopher Nolan's Batman films. Not by Nolan personally, she said. It wasn't a Catwoman-size part.
"It wasn't like we were talking to the top of the top in terms of who was casting the thing," she said, "But they said they weren't 'going urban.' I thought that was really funny."
A lot has changed since - for Kravitz personally, and in the business as a whole. From Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie in Marvel's cinematic universe to Halle Bailey's Ariel in the forthcoming live-action "Little Mermaid" reboot, it's become less unusual for actors of color to bookroles not originally conceived with an actor of color in mind, particularly in comic-book and fantasy material, where parallel universes collide and anything is possible.
Sometimes, though, inclusive casting highlights just how much work Hollywood - newly woke but still groggy - has left to do, when it comes to actually telling diverse stories. For two seasons, on HBO's "Big Little Lies," Kravitz has played Bonnie Carlson, the yoga-instructor wife of Reese Witherspoon's character's hunky ex. Amid a stacked cast of A-listers going for broke - trashing one another verbally, sometimes trashing rooms literally - she's been an island of wary reserve, her eyes suggesting painful depths.
But in the first season Bonnie seemed to float at the periphery of a story that prioritized the tribulations of its well-to-do white characters instead. In the second season, Bonnie got a real story line - which required her to sit by her comatose mother in a hospital room few of the other characters ever visited. Critics and viewers noticed; the show was roundly criticized for Its apparent lack of Interest in Bonnie's inner life.
Kravitz said she'd been drawn to the role of Bonnie - who's white in the Liane Moriarty novel that inspired the series - because it was a chance to work with director Jean-Marc Val léé and with "this dream cast" of Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Laura Dem and Shailene Woodiey, who she'd made three "Divergent" movies with and who she'd practically grown up alongside. When she first read the script, Kravitz said, "it felt really fresh and necessary, and like it was filling some kind of creative void I didn't know I'd really had."
It didn't bother her, she said, that the show never acknowledged that Bonnie was the only prominent person of color in the series' otherwise monochromatic Northern California milieu.
"In the first season, there was something really refreshing about not making that a story line," she said. "It's frustrating when people of color can only play a character that's written as a minority," she added. "So it's refreshing when it's not about that. But it's complicated, because you don't want to ignore that fact. Part of our responsibility as storytellers is to tell the truth."
Kravitz is an executive producer of "High Fidelity" as well as its star, and the show - funny and poignant and surprisingly personal - feels like a product of her sensibility. Kravitz, who attended high school in New York and has fond memories of loitering after school in grubby record shops like Kim's Video and Music, the bygone East Village institution, said she'd long been a fan of the book and particularly of Stephen Frears' film version from 2000, which starred John Cusack as Rob and Lisa Bonet as a singer with whom he rebounds.
"For some reason," she said, '"High Fidelity' was one of the few pieces of art that my parents had been a part of that I was really able to separate from them. It's a weird thing, because it can be really uncomfortable and strange watching your mom kiss John Cusack or whatever, but it became a film that I loved and watched and could quote."
In the initial script, the main character lived in Los Angeles and would have worked at a radio station. Kravitz proposed moving it to New York, and into a dusty basement record shop. Those choices, she said: helped determine other aspects of the show, like setting the story ir Crown Heights, a part of Brooklyr where a dusty basement record shop and its owner could realistically survive. (Kravitz, who married actor Karl Glusman last June, has lived in Williamsburg for more than 10 years long enough to watch gentrification transform it; her favorite bagel shop is now an Apple Store.)
The staff of the record store now consists of two women of color (Kravitz's Rob and Da'Vine Joy Randolph of "Dolemite Is My Name") and a shy, gay man (David Holmes). When Rob runs down her top five heartbreaks in flashback, the list includes women as well as men.
None of this, Kravitz said, was about clearing some imaginary bar for wokeness. They just wanted e cast that looked real.
"I was trying to recreate a world' that I know," Kravitz said, "and that's what it looks like. It doesn't look like a bunch of white girls, like the show 'Girls,' " whose portrayal of New York-area hipsterdom struck many viewers - Kravitz included - as demographically specious.
"If that show was in Iowa or something, fine, but you're living in Brooklyn," she said. "There's people of color everywhere. It's unavoidable Same thing with Woody Allen - like how do you not háve Black people in your movies? It's impossible. They're everywhere. We're everywhere. I'nr sorry, but we're everywhere."
Kravitz acknowledged that there might be reflexive resistance to the idea of a gender-flipped "High Fidelity," as there is to gender-flipped anything, among a certain class of consumers. "I think a lot of white men who identified with the book think it's theirs," Kravitz said, "and are ready for us to screw it up, aną. are going to have trouble seeing it in a different light. But I think if they get past that thing, they'll see that we actually really did honor theproperty, I think."

Texto completo: GREENSBORO, N.C. - The New Africa Business and Cultural Center (NABCC) of W.D. Mohammed Islamic Center, in Greensboro, will host a weekend symposium on 2020 Community and Economic Stabilization, Fri., Feb. 28 - Sun., March 1, 2020.
Editor of Muslim Journal Ayesha K. Mustafaa will be the keynote speaker, Saturday night, Feb. 29, and address the topic "African Americans and the Vote." The symposium will also feature discussions on business, education and culture.
This weekend event is important because the right to vote was hard-won for the African American community and economic stabilization has been elusive.
Alarmingly, it has been predicted that the median household wealth for black families will be zero by the year 2053.
The 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution gave African American men the right to vote on Feb. 3, 1870. It reads:
1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
2. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Furthermore, the 15th Amendment followed a succession of amendments that 1) freed enslaved Africans, the 13th
Amendment on Dec. 6, 1865, and 2) gave them citizenship rights, 14th Amendment on July 9,1868.
However, African American women gained the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave all women the right to vote on Aug. 18,1920.
Although African Americans were given the right to vote, un-Americans have opposed their efforts to vote since 1876.
Six years after its ratification, in the U.S. Supreme Court case of United States vs Reese, the challenge to the 15th Amendment limited prosecution of voter suppression solely upon "race, color, and previous condition of servitude."
But it allowed other forms of suppression, such as poll taxes, literacy tests and currently, gerrymandering and ex-offender status.
A classic example of the effort to thwart Black votes is the coup that took place in Wilmington, NC, in 1898, which will be examined during the symposium.
So noted, "Wilmington, in the 1890s, was considered to be a progressive city; it was majority African American, with three African Americans on its Board of Alderman, 30 percent of the skilled craftsmen were African Americans, and Alexander and Frank Manley owned the only African American daily paper in the United States," said Vince Winkle, et al., in the article "Understanding 1898: America's Only Coup D' e'tat."
According to Winkle, the election of diverse politicians was the result of Fusion politics: the Republican party, which was the party of Lincoln, included African Americans and the Populist party, which was represented by farmers and working-class whites.
The Democratic Party constituted landowners and wealth. When the Fusion coalition won again in 1896, the Democrats began a campaign to raise "white supremacist fervor," and they succeeded, according to Winkle.
Yet, the election was not until 1899, which did not deter the Democrats from overthrowing the government, murdering African Americans, destroying black businesses, and burning the offices of the African American owned newspaper.
A year later, the Democratic government of Wilmington passed Jim Crow laws that stifled African American voters and their freedom until the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.
Today in North Carolina and throughout the United States, African Americans are experiencing a resurgence of voter suppression and the rise of "white supremacist fervor."
In 1898, it was the Democratic Party; in 2020, ironically, it is the Republican Party.
Even the dismantling of President Obama's accomplishments, such as The Affordable Healthcare Act (Obamacare), Paris Climate Agreement, Iran Nuclear Treaty, blockage of the Dakota pipeline, and military use of landmines are reminiscent of the Reconstruction period.
In reaction, white supremacists eradicated the social and political gains of Reconstruction because African Americans had achieved them.
From these warning signs, it is clear that African Americans must be vigilant regarding their persons, and like their ancestors, determined to exercise their right to vote.
But why have un-Ameri-cans been so relentless in their efforts to suppress African American votes?
Is it because the legacy of African American voter participation and activism has brought America closer to its ideals of freedom, justice and equality for all of its citizens?
The African American legacy, as Imam W D. Mohammed has said is like that of Bilal ibn Rabah (may Allah be pleased with him), the first muezzin or caller to prayer. African Americans have called the United States back to its founding principles.
Similarly, Nikole Hannah-Jones, a journalist in the New York Times' 1619 Project stated, "Our founding ideals of liberty and equality were false when they were written. Black Americans fought to make them true. Without this struggle, America would have no democracy at all."
In conclusion, the struggle continues, and you are invited to share in this 2020 Cultural and Economic Stabilization Weekend Symposium, Feb. 28 -March 1, 2020, in the New Africa Business and Cultural Center of W. D. Mohammed Islamic Center, Greensboro.

How two Boston women became legends in the sport of cycling

Texto completo: At the height of the bicycling craze in the 1890s, Boston was home to two trailblazing female cyclists: Kittie Knox, who broke racial barriers to compete, and Annie Londonderry, who gained international fame for embarking on an epic bike ride around the world.
And they both lived in the same neighborhood: the West End.
“They lived just a few blocks from each other, at the same time," said author Lorenz J. Finison, who has written two books about Boston's cycling history.
The fascinating stories of how these two female cyclists overcame discrimination and challenged the status quo are highlighted in a new exhibit called “Cycling Legends of the West End," which runs through May 30 at the West End Museum.
Several programs are complementing the exhibition. On Saturday, a reception will be held in the afternoon followed by a “West End Heritage Night" celebrating the life of Kittie Knox and her contributions to the sport of cycling.
Knox “confronted racism head-on" and “promoted women's independence ... by daring to don pantaloons while riding instead of the heavy, long skirts of her day," museum officials said in a press release. “She bravely challenged race and gender roles in cycling, forever changing its future and advancing equality for African Americans and women alike."
Born in Cambridge in 1874 to a Black father and a white mother, Knox was a seamstress and an accomplished cyclist who belonged to the League of American Wheelmen (also known as LAW).
When some chapters of LAW sought to ban Black cyclists from joining the league, Knox didn't back down. In 1895, she attended the league's national meet in Asbury Park, N.J., where she did not exactly receive a warm welcome.
“There was quite a bit of controversy at that summer meet in Asbury," said Finison.
Knox got turned away from hotels, but eventually found a place to stay and made her presence known throughout the meet. She made national headlines for challenging the league's “color bar."
“This afternoon Miss Knox did a few fancy cuts in front of the clubhouse and was requested to desist," the New York Times reported on July 9, 1895. "It is thought that this episode will result in temporarily opening the color line question."
On July 10, 1895, the San Francisco Call ran a story about Knox attending the meet and how league officials refused to give her a credential badge. “ When Miss Knox, whose appearance and dress had been objects of admiration all day, walked into the committee-room at the local clubhouse and presented her League card for a credential badge, the gentleman in charge refused to recognize the card, and the young woman withdrew very quietly. Ninety-nine out of every hundred members interviewed express the heartiest sympathy for her and condemnation of the hasty action of the badge committee."
According to that story, one LAW official from Boston said he “considered the refusal entirely unwarranted."
Finison said Knox stayed at the meet and even danced at the evening ball.
About two weeks later, Knox's name and the issue of race came up in the July 26, 1895 edition of the LAW Bulletin. In the Q and A section of the league's weekly journal, a member asked: “How can a negro be a member of the L.A.W. as it appears Miss Knox of Boston is?" In response, league officials said: “Miss Katie J. Knox joined the League, April 1, 1893. The word 'white' was put into the constitution, Feb. 20, 1894. Such laws are not and cannot be retroactive."
Today, Knox is viewed as a hero. Just last month, the Smithsonian Libraries highlighted some of her accomplishments in a series of tweets, noting that “she continued to participate in meets around the country" and "helped democratize cycling - for both women and cyclists of all races."
Around the same time, another West End woman was gaining international fame as she pedaled around the world. Annie Cohen Kopchovsky, who used the alias Annie Londonderry, was a Latvian/Jewish immigrant who lived on Spring Street in Boston's West End. In June 1894, she bid goodbye to her husband and three young children and embarked on an epic bike ride around the globe that took 15 months to complete.
She earned money during the trip by pinning advertisements to her clothes.
At one point on her journey through France, she said three masked men tried to rob her. According to her story in the San Francisco Examiner, the robbers knocked her off her bike and she was thrown down to the ground. That's when she pulled out a revolver from the holster on her belt and aimed it at her assailants. One of the men backed off but another got behind her and grabbed her throat. She said they wrestled the weapon from her hands and rifled through her pockets, but she only had three francs, and she managed to escape.
“The fall from the wheel sprained my ankle and my shoulder was bruised considerably, but I had enough vitality left to continue the journey," she told the San Francisco Examiner.

South Carolina is supposed to be Joe Biden's firewall. How's that going these days?

Texto completo: ROCK HILL, S.C. -- It was supposed to be his campaign's firewall.
For months, former vice president Joe Biden has counted on South Carolina as a sure early win in the Democratic presidential race that would leave no question he was the party's best choice to take on President Trump. But after lackluster early state performances, sinking national poll numbers, and mediocre debate performances, many people in South Carolina cringe at the notion that its diverse electorate would rescue Biden's struggling campaign.
“It's like he's taking South Carolina for granted," said Linda Love, 67, who came last week to a phone bank for Biden despite her frustrations. “You cannot treat African-Americans like that. You cannot take us for granted."
Biden's campaign no longer calls the state his firewall, now referring to it as a “springboard" to more victories on Super Tuesday, which follows three days after Saturday's primary here. And Biden was buoyed by his apparent second-place finish in the Nevada caucuses, although he was trounced by the winner, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
“We're going to win in South Carolina and then Super Tuesday and we are on our way," Biden told his supporters in Las Vegas Saturday.
He still could pull off a win in South Carolina, where he has consistently led in the polls. But Biden's status as the unshakable front-runner has slipped and his firewall is showing cracks.
A poll released Sunday by CBS News and YouGov found Biden's lead in South Carolina down to five percentage points over Sanders, within the margin of error and consistent with recent polls showing a tightening race.
Biden's 28 percent support is down from 45 percent in the same poll in November. Sanders came in at 23 percent followed by billionaire investor Tom Steyer at 18 percent. The poll found Biden with the most support among Black voters at 35 percent, with Steyer at 24 percent and Sanders at 23 percent. But in November Biden had 54 percent support from Black voters, who make up about 6 in 10 Democratic voters in the state.
Representative Jim Clyburn, the most powerful Democrat in South Carolina, said Sunday that he had heard from “a lot of people" that Biden could have performed better in the debates so far and in making a stronger case for his candidacy. But Clyburn still thought Biden would win the state's Black vote.
“All these candidates will get some African-American votes," Clyburn told NBC's “Meet the Press." “I do believe, however, that if we were having the election tomorrow, Joe Biden would have more of the vote. How much more I don't know yet."
Clyburn plans to announce his endorsement on Wednesday morning after the Democratic debate in Charleston the previous night. If he chooses Biden, that could be a big boost to his chances in South Carolina.
Last week, as Biden campaigned in Nevada, one of his top surrogates, former secretary of state John Kerry, came to this suburb near the North Carolina border to fire up volunteers.
Instead, he met a room full of worry.
“We're all aware of the polls and the primaries that have occurred in Iowa and New Hampshire. How can this campaign gain momentum within itself?" Kerry was asked by Sally Schimelpfenig 66, of York. “We're the quiet group. I think we need to make noise."
“I'm not being quiet … I'm here because I know what you have to do, you have to fight for it," Kerry responded, pitching Biden as a unifying candidate and the best equipped to win key battleground states in the Midwest.
Then Love piped up, worrying about Trump's attacks on Biden's son, Hunter.
“You know Trump is going to attack [Biden] on his son in Ukraine. How do we get past those personal attacks?" she asked Kerry.
Many in the state still believe Biden has a strong chance at victory, if not by the margins he once expected. On the day of the New Hampshire primary, as it became clear he would not perform well, Biden came to Columbia, a sign of how much he is counting on South Carolina.
“Oh, he's going to win South Carolina, no doubt about it in my mind," said Jim Thompson, chairman of the York County Democratic Party. “Not by 30 points, but I would say 12, 14 points, a significant margin."
Still, Thompson and others acknowledge the strong organizing power of Sanders in the state and the undeniable presence of Steyer, who has flooded the airwaves with ads. Former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg is not on the South Carolina ballot.
York County, home to about 15 percent of the state's Democratic voters, is a popular stop for presidential hopefuls. The last time Biden came was in August.
Love said Biden should have visited more often and needs to improve in the polls to make people feel confident about entrusting him with their vote.
Outside urban centers such as Columbia and Charleston and middle-class suburbs including Rock Hill, many of the voters Biden is counting on live in rural areas where people struggle with low wages, underfunded schools, and difficult access to doctors and hospitals.
In Mullins, a small town in rural Marion County, Miko Pickett, 51, said she has watched other campaigns organize while Biden has not. A quarter of Marion County residents live in poverty, one of the highest rates in the state.
“[Biden] assumes he has it locked in and truthfully, he does," said Pickett, who until recently served on the executive committee of the county Democratic Party. “If nobody else came to Marion County, on Election Day, I guarantee Marion County is going 100 percent for Biden, or 90 percent. But where he's mistaken is people are showing up. Bernie is here and he is showing up. Tom Steyer is here. I think they're going to give him a run for his money, and that's just my county."
Terri Brigman, 55, likes Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. “Give a woman a chance. We are smart," she said.
Brigman said people in Mullins initially assumed they would vote for Biden because of his association with former president Barack Obama. But then Trump started to worry them with his accusations about Biden's son, she said.
“Now they say, 'Hey, well, Biden is a crook, too,' " Brigman said.
Pickett said Sanders' ground game in Marion County has been the best thanks to one relentless organizer. And his platform makes sense to people here, especially raising the minimum wage, which has been $7.25 in South Carolina for more than a decade.
“Bernie's message, it resonates with our community," Pickett said. “Fifteen dollars an hour would change life."
Nevertheless, the Obama legacy is hard to shake. Brenda Bennett, 65, still believes Biden is a solid bet to beat Trump. She laughs at the idea of Sanders as the nominee.
Bennett, who lives in a neat white trailer home in Mullins, recently retired from a factory where she sealed ready-to-eat meals for the military. Her starting wage was about $7.25 an hour, she said. Eighteen years later, it had risen only to $11.92.
No one has come to knock on her door or left campaign fliers, Bennett said. But she doubts any of the candidates or their staff would understand how hard she has worked to put together a life on meager wages.
“They haven't been there. You got to be in there on the poverty line," she said. “Or beneath poverty, they'll know then. They ain't touched the surface."

New Super PAC has spent more than $1 million backing Klobuchar

Texto completo: A new Super PAC supporting Sen. Amy Klobuchar has spent more than $1.2 million on television and digital advertisements in the last week.
The Super PAC, Kitchen Table Conversations, filed their intent to spend money on Klobuchar last Friday. Since then, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, the committee has spent significant sums of money in Nevada and South Carolina: More than $930,000 in South Carolina and $345,000 in Nevada. The Nevada Caucus is this Saturday and South Carolina’s primary is next Saturday.
The group has created at least four advertisements in support of Klobuchar: three English language ads and one in Spanish. One speaks to Klobuchar’s first experiences dealing with legislative change: pushing for mothers in Minnesota to be entitled to longer hospital stays, instead of being forced out of the hospital 24 hours after birth.
“She built a bipartisan Minnesota coalition. And helped stop it there,” the ad says. “That’s what Amy Klobuchar does: sees a problem, fixes it, and wins when it matters.”
The Super PAC was created by Richard Carlbom and Kristen McMullen, two prominent DFL activists that work at political consulting firm UnitedStrategies, to push Klobuchar’s campaign forward through Nevada, South Carolina, and Super Tuesday.
Klobuchar has struggled to gain traction beyond Iowa and New Hampshire, where she received fifth and third place respectively. Polls show Klobuchar nowhere near the lead in Nevada or South Carolina.
Nevada Caucus polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics place Klobuchar in sixth place, with around 10 percent of voters, behind Sen. Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Tom Steyer.
Much of the same is true for the South Carolina Primary, where Klobuchar also averages a sixth place spot in the polls, or 7.3 percent, behind Biden, Sanders, Steyer, Buttigieg, and Warren. Her support with black voters, who make up a majority of likely Democratic voters in the state, is nonexistent.
Kitchen Table Conversations is spending heavily on television advertisements, with more than $1.2 million earmarked specifically for that, and only a bit more than $65,000 to buy digital advertisements.
It’s unclear who is funding the effort. The Super PAC does not have to disclose its donors until April, the next required FEC filing period.
Only one group has come forward as a funder: Emily’s List, the largest political action committee supporting pro-choice Democratic female candidates for office. The group’s Vice President told the New York Times that they’ve given $250,000 to both Kitchen Table Conversations and another Super PAC, Persist PAC, recently created to support Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign.
“Everyone on this stage except Amy and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending,” Warren said barely two weeks ago at the Democratic debate in New Hampshire.
Now, no one can make that claim.
On Thursday, Warren told reporters the rules of engagement have changed.
“So here’s where I stand: If all the candidates want to get rid of super PACs, count me in — I’ll lead the charge,” she said. “But that’s how it has to be. It can’t be the case that a bunch of people keep them and only one or two don’t.”

Texto completo: Last year, I inherited an old button-up wool shirt in red and black buffalo check. It’s a heavy piece of clothing, made of thick, itchy wool, with cuffs worn from years of wear.
The shirt had belonged to my grandma, a woman who died before I was born. She’d had it since she was younger than me: There’s apparently some picture somewhere of her hoisting a beer stein at a late-1940s University of Minnesota sorority function in it.
She and my grandpa took their three girls camping every summer when they were little. On these trips, my grandma often wore this shirt. It used to smell like campfire, my mom said, and seeing the shirt again after so many years brought back lots of memories.
The shirt came out of retirement at a good time. Buffalo check has been having a moment. It was featured in a New York Times magazine style piece. It was spotted on Kylie Jenner. It’s suddenly everywhere.
But in Minnesota, it never really went away. Buffalo check is synonymous with the northwoods, found in cabins, on throws, in the governor’s residence, and on Paul Bunyan’s enormous plaid shirt.
How did buffalo check become so deeply tied to life here?
Origins
Like buffalo plaid’s biggest fashion icon, the history of the pattern is somewhat shrouded in legend.
The origin of buffalo check isn’t Minnesotan at all, or even American. It’s Scottish. The pattern, which alternates red checks, black checks, and dual-tone red and black checks, is listed in the Scottish Register of Tartans as “Rob Roy MacGregor,” and dates to the early 1700s.
It got the name “Rob Roy” through association with Rob Roy MacGregor, a Highland outlaw-turned Robin Hood figure immortalized in a Sir Walter Scott book. (Members of the Clan Gregor say the “Rob Roy” name is a misnomer, since he wasn’t, they claim, a member of their clan. They call it MacGregor black.)
Regardless of its Scottish origins, Pennsylvania-based Woolrich started producing the pattern in the U.S. in 1850.
Woolrich supposedly named the pattern “buffalo” in honor of the young man who first weaved it for them, who kept bison on his hobby farm. According to the Baltimore Sun, John Rich II, the co-founder of Woolrich, traveled to lumber camps with a mule-drawn cart to sell his wool goods in the surrounding mountains.
Checkered past
Minnesota can’t claim to have invented buffalo check, but it is very popular here.
Bemidji Woolen Mills, one of many companies that produces buffalo check, has been making goods in the pattern since the year the company was founded, 1920, said Bill Batchelder, the company’s fourth-generation owner. But checkerboard-patterned plaid seems to have been in the area before then.
If you look at old logging camp pictures, lumberjacks are often wearing checked shirts. The pictures are black and white, so it’s tough to determine exactly what colors these lumberjacks might have been wearing, but white and black checks actually appeared to be more common than red and black, said Catherine Daly, a research associate at the Celtic Junction Art Center’s Eoin McKiernan Library, who has researched lumberjack dress.
Apart from the need to dress warmly in a northwoods logging season that spanned the coldest months, there was a certain uniformity to lumberjack dress, owing to the fact that many loggers bought their clothing in camp stores at their worksites, Daly said.
The logging boom was mostly over by the 1920s. As lumberjacks became scarce, the clothing manufacturers who had once catered to them set their sights on a new target demographic: the leisure class.
“Sportswear came about because people had money — they were able to spend money on clothing that was specialized for certain activities,” Daly said: Like logging, hunting and fishing were then considered manly pursuits, and men looked to the image of the lumberjack as they dressed for the outdoors.
Around this time, the myth of Paul Bunyan, the giant lumberjack who made lakes with his footprints and combed his beard with pine trees, made his way from logging camp lore to the broader public imagination.
Red River Lumber Company, in Akeley, Minnesota, hired an illustrator to draw Paul Bunyan. William Laughead’s stories and illustrations brought Paul Bunyan to life for a wider audience in a series of pamphlets marketing Red River Lumber products.
In Laughead’s illustrations, Bunyan was first depicted in red and white plaid, Daly said. At some point though, Bunyan became oft-associated with red and black. In statutes in Minnesota and Maine — even the animatronic Bunyan at the Mall of America — he’s depicted in red and black buffalo check.
Daly thinks the popularity of red and black buffalo check came from the sportswear industry. By the 1940s, buffalo check was all over the place. Sears and other Department stores advertised buffalo check “leisurejack” suits, shirts for boys and women’s after ski suits.
Bemidji style
Batchelder has been working at Bemidji Woolen Mills, the company founded by his grandfather and great-grandfather, since 1972. In his early days there, he wondered why his family kept producing buffalo plaid year after year after year.
“I always challenged my father, my grandfather and my uncle. I said, ‘When are we going to do something new? This red and black, we have it every year. I’m looking at these other fashion houses; they change every single year,’” Batchelder remembered. “My grandfather said ‘The red and black buffalo shirt has always been our best-selling shirt. It continues to be our best-selling shirt.’”
Batchelder has since come around to his grandfather’s way of thinking on buffalo plaid. “I actually have a file in my office, and it’s titled ‘All Things Buffalo Plaid,’ so whenever I get something that’s buffalo plaid, I put it in there.” The folder’s contents include sleeves from Caribou Coffee cups, a Farm Bureau brochure, a Bike Alliance Minnesota Survey report, a Hockey Day in Minnesota sponsorship card and lots of other items.
Buffalo check has come to be associated, especially, with Bemidji, not just because of Bemidji Woolen Mills making it there for 100 years, but also because of residents’ sometimes-concerted efforts to wear it, both in and out of Bemidji.
Every year, the Bemidji Chamber of Commerce organizes a Bemidji Day at the Minnesota State Capitol. But nobody gets on the bus to go unless they’re wearing a red and black buffalo check shirt or vest from Bemidji Woolen Mills, Batchelder said.
Because the red and black is so distinctive, Batchelder’s heard Bemidji Day is the most well-recognized at the capitol.
Pretty much every governor in recent memory has had his own Bemidji Woolen Mills plaid shirt, Batchelder said — since long before Gov. Tim Walz, a notorious wearer of red and black plaid (Batchelder said Walz’s favorite jacket is not quite buffalo check, and perhaps only half-joked that he’s heartbroken it was made by Filson, a Seattle brand).
As for the pattern’s lasting appeal?
“It looks really good on everyone, whether you’re a young person, a middle-aged person or an older person,” Batchelder said. “It really goes good with khakis. It goes good with jeans. It goes good with black pants. It just seems that it is probably the most multi-purpose plaid out there.”
Bringing back plaid
Susan Brown, a textile curator at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, said she thinks the enduring popularity of buffalo check might have to do with its place in history. “I think of logging, or woodsmanship more broadly, as a kind of northern version of cowboy culture — a particularly American form of being in nature as a working person, rather than a hiker/tourist/pleasure seeker,” she wrote in an email.
As opposed to the garments associated with hunting and being in the woods today — safety orange and camouflage, which are complicated by military and gun rights associations, “buffalo check takes us back to a simpler, less politicized vision of American identity,” she wrote.
Daly doesn’t think it’s necessarily a coincidence that Buffalo check was so big in 2016 and 2017, though its popularity seems to have diminished somewhat more recently. Buffalo check evokes warmth, coziness, and it cuts across class distinctions.
“You have to look at the politics. People are trying to find some safety net, I think,” she said.

Texto completo: Technocrat multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg is the Republican now trying to buy the Democratic presidential nomination and use establishment media elites to throttle Bernie Sanders.
And the other evening he took a serious beating at the Democratic presidential debate in Nevada.
Bloomberg was knocked right out of his shoes. He never recovered. He must have been thinking, "I just spent $400 million for this? I should've been a farmer."
It was Sen. Elizabeth Warren who delivered the punch. It was Homeric, like punches thrown in old Chicago ward fights along Archer Avenue on Election Day. One big right hand and all that remained were Bloomberg's empty little loafers on the floor.
"I'd like to talk about who we're running against: a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians,' " said Warren. "And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Michael Bloomberg."
There was no recovering from it. He tried to shrug off his old comments as "jokes." The audience groaned.
The WrestleMania theatrics of the Democratic debate were entertaining. But it distracts from a fundamental and inconvenient truth facing the pro-Bloomberg Democratic establishment and its media allies.
They've spent the last three years stoking voters in a frenzy to hate that orange Republican whom they describe as an autocrat who threatens the Constitution.
But who does the Democratic establishment choose as champion? Another autocrat who says the Constitution is outdated.
There are so many Bloomberg quotes out there beyond "horse-faced lesbians" that should be of concern. Bloomberg thinks that taxing the poor is the best means to bend them to his will. He looks down his nose at the little people, at farmers and factory workers, and has said that the Constitution is just too "old-fashioned" for his tastes.
His slogan is "Mike Will Get It Done." But what will he do with federal power? He doesn't say.
This isn't about inspiring voters. This is the wedding song of Big Corporate and Big Government, the song Hillary Clinton once sang to Wall Street. And Bloomberg is Wall Street.
Whether Bloomberg would make an effective president or not isn't the issue here. You need to win elections first. And I see a serious flaw in establishment Democrat strategy. I could be wrong.
But I'm not wrong about Bloomberg's lack of appeal, as Sanders keeps exciting the base. The young see Sanders as authentic and Bloomberg as bloodless. Can Bloomberg fill stadiums of people who love him? If he pays them enough.
The common wisdom is that the Democratic debate was such a wild bar fight that the winner was President Trump. But Trump didn't win. Sanders won. He's the front-runner. His voters are the passionate base of the Democratic Party now.
If this trend continues, the only way Democratic Party bosses can stop Sanders is to rig the Democratic National Convention against him and use their trusty superdelegates to deny Sanders the nomination.
But what would the bosses win if they stabbed Sanders this way in two successive elections?
Not the presidency.
Bloomberg forgets he's in a Democratic primary. Democrats are woke warriors, a party that rolls left along that Intersectionality Highway in their quest for power, and New York Times columnists -- including Thomas Friedman, whose wife's museum is the beneficiary of Bloomberg's grand philanthropy -- weren't up on the debate stage to defend him. And Bloomberg couldn't defend himself. His wisecracks about "fat broads" won't be tolerated among the woke left that threatens his ambitions.
So how does the establishment media save him now? Voters were looking for strength, quick wits and courage from Bloomberg, but didn't find it in Nevada. Bloomberg can dip into his pocket change tomorrow and find a quick half-billion dollars to spend on political commercials, and perhaps by sheer force of his wealth, he might drive his dismal debate performance from voters' minds.
The Democratic establishment banked on the Trump impeachment destroying his popularity. They banked on Biden to save them. The impeachment backfired, as did the Russia collusion fantasy, and Trump's numbers keep climbing.
And Biden? The longer he talks, the older he looks, and you start noticing odd things about him, the way his mouth works and that ear hair that wasn't trimmed.
Sanders is no corporatist. He's a leftist and I disagree with most all his policies. In the debate, Bloomberg used the "C" word against Sanders, "Communist," a clip that will be used in Trump ads.
Though I believe Sanders is wrong on policy, his politics are effective because he's tapped into something. Democrat Andrew Yang understood it early, and though Yang dropped out of the race, it speaks to the Bloomberg flaw in Democratic strategy.
America and the world are preparing for great change that will make the social upheaval caused by the Industrial Revolution seem quaint and small, like children playing with old tin soldiers.
We'll see more automation, robots, AI, driverless cars and trucks, and the new lords, the great technocrats, will push the skilled and the unskilled into economic exile.
It will be massive. People feel it now, already, especially young people. Just ask them. And if they're not afraid, exactly, of the Technocratic Lords, they're worried about their place in that world. Human beings vote their anxiety, as the time of the Technocrats advances upon them.
And so, who does the Democratic establishment and establishment media handmaidens prop up as their champion to save them from Sanders?
The Lord High Technocrat himself. The autocrat. Bloomberg.

Texto completo: The New York Times reported on Thursday that "intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected."
I'm not convinced that gives full context to the briefing. I suspect a Democratic member asked a briefer something along the lines of, "Do you assess that Russia is trying to reelect Trump?" The briefer then probably offered a hedged response in the affirmative. I believe the core of the briefing was likely situated around an assessment that Russia is preparing to ramp up efforts to undermine the election and U.S. civil society.
That's very different from that which the New York Times report implies: a high-confidence national intelligence assessment that Russia is interfering to see Trump triumph over any and all of the Democratic presidential primary field.
First off, any intelligence assessment that Russia is interfering to reelect Trump would require a wide depth of diverse, high-value sources. At the very least, any intelligence product offering that conclusion would be based on highly reliable human source and signal intelligence reporting from or on people close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the GRU, and each Russian government/contractor arm the United States believes is engaged in the interference effort. Considering the sensitivity with which any Russian 2020 interference operation will be regarded in Moscow (which is keen to avoid new U.S. sanctions or other retaliatory measures and so will work to maintain deniability), it is unlikely that the full degree and election-outcome intent of Russia's interference campaign are yet known. At least to the degree, that is, that would allow the intelligence community to come before the assembled mass of the congressional intelligence committees and offer a high confidence assessment to that effect.
There's another critical factor to consider here: Putin's strategic intent.
The Russian leader has three key objectives vis-à-vis America: undermining NATO and the U.S.-led international order, usurping American leadership in the Middle East, and ensuring Russian political and energy dominance in Central and Eastern Europe. Considering that baseline, there is simply no way that Putin has decided Trump will be better for those outcomes than any and all of the Democrats trying to unseat him.
Joe Biden? Likely yes, due to his longtime record of support for NATO and his former access to the highest level intelligence briefings (Biden knows what Putin is like). The rest of the Democratic field?
Well, consider the contrasting records.
Yes, Trump has made misguided comments with regards to his personal relationship with Putin. But he has also presided over very significant increases in U.S. and NATO defense outlays, the unified alignment of that alliance in resistance to Russian ballistic missile proliferation, more aggressive intelligence operations against Russia, and the deployment of U.S. nuclear strike capabilities specifically designed to challenge Russia's evolved strategic doctrine. The scaled nuclear development and defense spending programs here are collectively opposed by the Democratic presidential field.
On Ukraine, aside from the obvious impeachment issues, Trump has provided Kyiv with lethal weapons and high-value intelligence support. Crucially, he has also provided diplomatic support against significant Franco-German pressure on President Volodymyr Zelesnky to accept a cease-fire on Russian terms.
On the associated issue of energy policy, only Trump stands in favor of that economic weapon Putin most fears: fracking and expanded U.S. energy exports. In contrast, the 2020 Democratic Party is a Putin dream world on this energy issue.
Similarly, Trump's strengthening of the U.S. alliances with Israel and the Sunni Arab monarchies is a major obstacle to Putin's effort to usurp America as the key international power broker in the Middle East. While Trump's abandonment of the Syrian Kurds has undermined U.S. credibility in the Middle East, he has restricted the confidence hemorrhage by retaining some U.S. military forces in Syria. The collective Democratic presidential field disagrees with Trump's approach, at least as applied to the Sunni monarchies.
One final issue here?
Bernie Sanders. Because the idea that Putin would prefer all the above to a president who took his honeymoon in the Soviet Union, likes many of Russia's allies, and wants to gut U.S. defense spending, end or greatly diminish U.S. alliances with the Sunni monarchies, and ban fracking?
Give me a break.

The test begins: Can the Taliban go a week without killing anyone?

Texto completo: THE COUNTDOWN STARTS: The U.S.-brokered seven-day reduction of violence agreement — a crucial prerequisite to the U.S. signing a troop withdrawal deal with the Taliban — takes effect at midnight tonight Afghanistan time, 2:30 p.m. today in Washington.
The stop American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, is tasked with making a determination as to whether the Taliban has held up its side of the bargain during the week that begins tomorrow.
The truce test comes as the Afghan government is in the midst of another elections crisis, with incumbent President Ashraf Ghani declared the winner of national elections but with his chief rival Abdullah Abdullah also declaring victory, citing voter fraud.
POMPEO: CARPE MOMENTUM: In a statement this morning Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that while challenges remain, “the progress made in Doha provides hope and represents a real opportunity. The United States calls on all Afghans to seize this moment.”
“Upon a successful implementation of this understanding, signing of the U.S.-Taliban agreement is expected to move forward. We are preparing for the signing to take place on February 29,” Pompeo said. “Intra-Afghan negotiations will start soon thereafter, and will build on this fundamental step to deliver a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire and the future political roadmap for Afghanistan.”
WHAT THE TALIBAN WANTS: In a highly controversial op-ed published in the New York Times, Sirajuddin Haqqani, the deputy leader of the Taliban, says his fighters are weary after more than 18 years of war, and are ready for “the opportunity for peace no matter how meager the prospects of its success.”
“For more than four decades, precious Afghan lives have been lost every day. Everyone has lost somebody they loved. Everyone is tired of war. I am convinced that the killing and the maiming must stop,” writes Haqqani. “We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone.”
“We are committed to working with other parties in a consultative manner of genuine respect to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded,” he said in the opinion piece headlined, “What We, the Taliban, Want.”
WHERE HAVE WE HEARD THAT NAME BEFORE? Sirajuddin Haqqani is leader of the notorious Haqqani network, and happens to be on FBI’s Most Wanted list, with a $5 million bounty on his head.
“Haqqani is wanted for questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen,” says the FBI on its wanted poster for the Taliban leader, who is said to have coordinated and participated in cross-border attacks against United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan. “Haqqani also allegedly was involved in the planning of the assassination attempt on Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008,” according to the FBI.
TERRORIST PROPAGANDA? The decision by the Times to publish the musings of a brutal terrorist sparked a fury of outrage on social media. “The NYT printed the op-ed propaganda of a known terrorist,’ tweeted House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy. “Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose father was a Bin Laden mentor, leads a terrorist group that has attacked our embassy, raped an American woman, & killed hundreds of our troops. What an insult to those who have lost loved ones.”
“I have some questions for @nytimes since they decided to give the Taliban a forum to spew garbage, like, “We did not choose our war...We were forced to defend ourselves,” tweeted Republican Rep. Liz Cheney. “1. Remember 9/11? 2. The author is a designated global terrorist. Did you pay him for this piece?”
“Appalled @nytimes has given leader of the Haqqani network and leader in Taliban room in their editorial pages to espouse his views,” tweeted Indiana Republican Rep. Jim Banks “Haqqani network is responsible for 1000s of Americans killed in Afghanistan and provides shelter to al Qaeda operatives... they sheltered Bin Laden.”
RELATED: Washington Examiner: Opinion: New York Times publishes Taliban propaganda.
ON THE DEFENSIVE: "We know firsthand how dangerous and destructive the Taliban is," said Eileen Murphy, the Times senior vice president of communications, in defense of the op-ed.
"Sirajuddin Haqqani is one of the negotiators hammering out an agreement with American officials in Doha that could result in American troops leaving Afghanistan. That makes his perspective relevant at this particular moment," Murphy said in an email to The Hill newspaper.

IRAN VOTES: Iranians are voting in parliamentary elections that the U.S. says have been rigged to give more power to hardliners who support Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei by disqualifying thousands of potential candidates in favor Khamenei’s allies.
“Any Iranian who wants to run for office must first be approved by the Guardian Council and its Committee for Election Supervision. The Guardian Council is led by a group of 12 unelected clerics and so-called legal experts. They decide who gets on the ballot. They are the ones who really get to vote in Iran,” said Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran at the State Department yesterday.
“For the elections tomorrow, the council denied more than 7,000 candidates the right to participate in the election. They also disqualified 90 sitting members of Iran’s parliament for running for re-election,” he said. “Unfortunately for the Iranian people, the real election took place in secret long before any ballots were even cast. This is how it has been for the last 41 years in Iran. “
COMING HOME: The Pentagon is beginning to withdraw some of the forces it surged to the Persuian Gulf region as tensions flared with Iran last month, now that the threat of war has diminished.
“It's fair to say we have seen a change in Iranians' behavior,” said Defense Secretary Mark Esper last week in Munich. “I think we restored deterrence. And it's something we watch very, very carefully.”
About 800 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division have returned to Fort Bragg, while roughly 2,700 other soldiers who were deployed then still remain in Kuwait. Officials described the rush to get extra troops to the region as the “most significant no-notice deployment of combat forces” in three decades.
CRISIS IN SYRIA: New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, says the Syrian government assault on the last rebel redoubt in northern Syria is a full-fledged humanitarian crisis.
“The unthinkable horrors unfolding in Idlib, Syria have been years in the making. More than 900,000 civilians have fled from the frontlines since December 1, most of whom are women and children,” Menendez said in a statement. “The Syrian regime and Russian aircraft are continuing to hammer civilians and refugees trying to flee from increasingly smaller spaces. Many of those who manage to escape the attacks are succumbing to the Syrian winter.”
“Now is the time for an immediate ceasefire between Russia, the Syrian regime, and Turkey. Now is the moment for the Turkish government to realign its security interests with those of the United States and NATO allies against the murderous regimes it is fighting on the ground,” Menendez said. “The Administration should reconsider its inhumane approach to those fleeing brutal violence and send a signal that we will stand with all those who are oppressed. The Administration must throw the full weight of American diplomacy into promoting stability.”
RELATED: The Middle East Institute holds a discussion on "The Crisis in Syria's Idlib.” at 10 a.m. today, with Zaher Sahloul, president and founder of MedGlobal; Elizabeth Tsurkov, fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute; Charles Lister, senior fellow and director of the Countering Terrorism and Extremism Program at MEI; and Alexander Marquardt, senior national correspondent at CNN.

Texto completo: President Trump’s chief of staff Mick Mulvaney rejected the notion that the president only likes to surround himself with people who agree with him.
“I disagree with the president every single day,” Mulvaney said. “You just don’t hear about it — that’s not my job.”
“The president looks for people who disagree with him and disagree with each other,” he said, adding that Trump “will sit back and watch” as his aides “go at it.”
He said the assessment that Trump lives in an echo chamber is fueled by aides declining to express their conflicting views in public.
“It’s our job to agree with the president all the time publicly,” he said. “Disagree with him privately.”
Mulvaney made the comments at a private gathering in England on Wednesday. Audio of the comments was provided to the New York Times.
He pointed to Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who has clashed with the president over tariffs.
Kudlow rose in prominence as “being one of the foremost free traders in the country,” Mulvaney said. “He’s now on TV regularly defending our tariff positions.”

‘The Russians are at it again’: Joy Behar slams Trump and 'complicit' Republicans over 2020 election meddling

Texto completo: The View host Joy Behar warned that Russians are working to get President Trump reelected.
Only weeks removed from the Senate's vote to find Trump not guilty on two articles of impeachment, Behar condemned Senate Republicans as "complicit" in Russian schemes to sway the 2020 presidential election in Trump's favor.
"The Russians are at it again," Behar said. "U.S. intelligence warns that Russia is meddling in the 2020 election, duh! And they want to keep Trump in office, double-duh!"
Behar's comments come a day after the New York Times reported a classified briefing last week in which lawmakers were told Russia is meddling in the upcoming presidential election in favor of Trump.
"This is his own intelligence community saying this," Behar said. "This is not some anti-Trump media talking about this. These are his people. So, should Democrats be his biggest concern, or should the Russians be his biggest concern? As if we didn't know."
"Can I just point out one thing?" Behar said. "The Republicans are complicit because last week the Senate, the Republican Senate, blocked three separate election security bills."

Texto completo: White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said he had not removed the "acting" part of his title because he makes a higher salary that way.
Mulvaney, who is also the director of the Office of Management and Budget, talked about keeping multiple positions during a Wednesday night speech at the Oxford Union.
“Because it’s a $20,000 pay cut,” he said about leaving the OMB position, according to the New York Times. Mulvaney's deputy, Russell Vought, took on the role of acting director of OMB in early 2019.
Through OMB, Mulvaney makes $203,500 a year. That salary is set by law. The position also requires Senate confirmation.
Reince Priebus and John Kelly, President Trump's first two chiefs of staff, earned $179,700 apiece, according to the Wall Street Journal. The maximum salary allowed for a White House aide is $183,000. That's what senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and Larry Kudlow, the president's top economic adviser, make.
If Mulvaney were to remove the temporary part of his title, he'd be forced to accept a decreased salary at or below that $183,000 marker.

Texto completo: Coronavirus cases have surged outside China, prompting other countries to adopt quarantine policies.
An increase in cases was reported across the Middle East and Asia this week, and some nations have begun shutting their borders to contain the infection. For instance, Iraq closed its border with Iran, the government of which reported 18 cases of coronavirus Friday as well as four deaths.
A woman traveling from Qom, Iran, to Lebanon on Thursday introduced the first case of coronavirus to the country, according to Health Minister Hamad Hassan. Two other Lebanese citizens are under investigation for possible infection.
At the same time, South Korea is seeing a drastic jump in coronavirus cases apparently tied to people who attend a specific church, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. South Korean officials are investigating the church’s members, who they say account for two-thirds of the total number of cases reported in South Korea, which has surpassed 200.
France, Germany, Britain, and Italy have reported cases so far. The Italian government reported a jump in cases throughout northern Italy on Friday, from three cases to 17 in just 24 hours, prompting the Italian Health Ministry to shut down schools and businesses in several Italian towns.
"We had prepared a plan in recent days because it was clear what has happened could somehow happen," Health Minister Roberto Speranza said, according to the New York Times.
Speranza said Italy is seeing the kinds of "cluster" of cases that have been reported in Germany and France. Italy was the first country in the European Union to adopt an all-out ban on flights to and from China on Jan. 31.
Coronavirus cases have already surpassed 76,000 in China and 28 other countries, and at least 2,200 people have died.

We’re living in a golden age of 'Choose Your Own Adventure' journalism

Texto completo: The New York Times on Feb. 20 published a shocking scoop: U.S. intelligence officials warned members of Congress recently that Russia is interfering in the 2020 U.S. election to “try to get President Trump re-elected,” according to anonymous sources.
The report also alleges that Trump “berated” outgoing acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire for briefing members of the House on the Kremlin’s reported interference efforts. Later, NBC News also cited anonymous sources to report that Maguire lost his job because he informed lawmakers of Russia’s meddling.

But on Feb. 21, CNN’s Jake Tapper reported that anonymous officials dispute the way the “story is being told.”

Whom do you believe? Who knows?

Because the New York Times, NBC, and CNN accounts are based entirely on nameless sources and the fact that there is no concrete evidence to back any version of events, the public is left with no other option than to pick whichever story sounds better.
We are living in a golden era of 'chose your own adventure' journalism.

The New York Times’s Feb. 20 report originally appeared with a headline that read, “Russia backs Trump’s re-election, and he fears Democrats will exploit its support.”

Its opening paragraphs read:
"Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected, five people familiar with the matter said, a disclosure to Congress that angered Mr. Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him. "The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant. "During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. … "After asking about the briefing that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other agencies gave to the House, Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Schiff would 'weaponize' the intelligence about Russia’s support for him, according to a person familiar with the briefing. And he was angry that no one had told him sooner about the briefing, the person said."
However, on Feb. 21, Tapper reported contradictory information.

“A national security official I know and trust pushes back on the way the briefing/ODNI story is being told, and others with firsthand knowledge agree with his assessment,” he tweeted.

The official told Tapper: “What's been articulated in the news is that the intelligence community has concluded that the Russians are trying to help Trump again. But the intelligence doesn't say that. The problem is [Shelby Pierson, who led the briefing] said they developed a preference for Trump. A more reasonable interpretation of the intelligence is not that they have a preference. It's a step short of that. It's more that they understand the president is someone they can work with. He's a dealmaker.”

That is not to say that the Russians have a preference for Trump over, say, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg or Soviet superfan Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the official continued.

“So it may have been mischaracterized by Shelby [during the briefing]," the official told Tapper.

"And by the way,” the person added, “both Democrats and Republicans were challenging this at the briefing."

As for Trump reportedly “berating” the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, Tapper reports that the president was “upset that he had to hear about an intelligence conclusion” from a Republican member of the House rather than directly from members of the intelligence community.

“So he was out of joint with Maguire on that process,” Tapper wrote.

A brief aside: Even if it is not true that Trump complained that Democrats would try to use the intelligence briefing against him, they are doing exactly that with the press’s coverage of Maguire’s exit.

“Putin’s Puppet is at it again,” tweeted twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, highlighting the NBC report about Maguire’s firing, “taking Russian help for himself. He knows he can’t win without it. And we can’t let it happen.”

As for whose reporting is likely more accurate, I agree with the Washington Examiner's Tom Rogan when he says the New York Times’s framing of the issue does not quite add up. It is a long, steady process divining Russia’s intent, which is obviously well-guarded, and it seems unlikely at this point in the 2020 election that U.S. intelligence officials have already gathered enough information to make what sound like definitive determinations about the Kremlin’s election-year plans. What likely happened is that someone asked during the briefing whether Russia is trying to reelect Trump, and Pierson or one of her colleagues likely answered with a “hedged response in the affirmative” before returning to the main point that Russia is going to use the 2020 election to sow chaos and confusion in the United States.

As Rogan notes, “That's very different from that which the New York Times report implies: a high-confidence national intelligence assessment that Russia is interfering to see Trump triumph over any and all of the Democratic presidential primary field.”

Trey Gowdy: Nobody really thinks Russia prefers Trump over 'comrade' Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: Former Rep. Trey Gowdy shot down a report suggesting Russia is planning to help President Trump in the 2020 election by saying he doubts the Kremlin prefers Trump over “comrade” Bernie Sanders.
“No. 1: I don’t know anyone who really thinks that Russia prefers Donald Trump to win over ‘comrade’ Sanders,” Gowdy told Fox News. “I don’t know a soul that really thinks Russia wants Donald Trump to be the president instead of the guy that honeymooned in Russia.”
Gowdy went on to point out that the intelligence community isn't infallible.
“No. 2: Is this the same intelligence community that told us it was a spontaneous reaction to a video in Libya and the same intelligence community that promised us weapons of mass destruction, and the same intelligence community that relied on the dossier?”
Gowdy also included a jab at Rep. Adam Schiff, who has been criticized by Republicans for his handling of the Russia investigation as well as the impeachment process.
“They gather information, and they make assessments,” he said. “Then, they give those assessments, but, unfortunately, you give them to people like Adam Schiff, who leak like sieves. This never should have been made public, and that’s why the president is upset, not at what the intelligence community has found but the fact that Adam Schiff has a beeline to the New York Times when it’s negative information about Donald Trump.”
Gowdy was referring to a New York Times report citing five unnamed sources that said the intelligence community gave a classified briefing to House lawmakers warning them that Russia was committed to helping Trump win in the upcoming November election.
A report on Friday by the Washington Post suggested that U.S. officials warned Bernie Sanders that Russia was interested in helping his presidential campaign.

National security official discredits NYT report on Russia helping Trump in 2020

Texto completo: Leaks about last week’s secretive briefing given to the House Intelligence Committee about Russia’s intentions in 2020 sparked contradictions and denials in the nation's capital.

A national security official cited by CNN’s Jake Tapper disputed the framing of stories from the New York Times and other outlets on Thursday that spoke of an intelligence assessment finding Russia is attempting to interfere in 2020's election to benefit President Trump.

The source, who Tapper said “I know and trust” and was in agreement with “others with firsthand knowledge," also added context to disputed claims from sources cited by the Washington Post that Trump is removing former Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire because the spy chief’s team briefed members of Congress about the assessment.

The classified briefing happened last Thursday and was conducted by Shelby Pierson, the Intelligence Community election threats executive under Maguire. During the meeting, Pierson warned that “Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected,” according to five people cited by the New York Times.
“What's been articulated in the news is that the intelligence community has concluded that the Russians are trying to help Trump again. But the intelligence doesn't say that,” Tapper’s source said. “The problem is Shelby said they developed a preference for Trump. A more reasonable interpretation of the intelligence is not that they have a preference, it's a step short of that.”
The national security official added that “it's more that they understand the president is someone they can work with, he's a dealmaker. But not that they prefer him over” his Democratic opponents.
“So it may have been mischaracterized by Shelby,” Tapper’s source said.
Trump disputed it too.

"Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates,” Trump tweeted Friday.
Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded the Russian government interfered in 2016's election in a “sweeping and systematic” fashion to help Trump, but did not establish any criminal conspiracy between the Kremlin and Trump's campaign.

Russian interference on behalf of Trump in 2020 has never been claimed publicly by the U.S. intelligence community.
The New York Times said, "Mr. Trump’s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that Mr. Trump has been tough on Russia" during the briefing. The national security official who talked with Tapper said that “both Democrats and Republicans were challenging" the assessment "at the briefing."
CBS News's Catherine Herridge tweeted her source “said briefers had none to offer" when pressed for details about whether there was signals intelligence to back up claims about Russia’s 2020 preference.
The day after the briefing, the New York Times reported Trump “berated” Maguire for letting it happen and said Trump “cited the presence in the briefing” of Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff “as a particular irritant.” The Washington Post cited a source who claimed the briefing “was the catalyst” that led Trump to replace him with U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell on Wednesday.
The New York Times cited two administration officials who said that “the timing was coincidental.”
The official cited by Tapper said, “The president was upset that he had to hear about an intelligence conclusion from a member of the House Republicans rather than from the intelligence community, so he was out of joint with Maguire on that process.”

Texto completo: President Trump said four people are under consideration to be his nominee for director of national intelligence after two potential candidates said they would not take the position.
Trump said Friday a decision on his pick would be made in the coming weeks.
Tweet
Joseph Maguire has been in the position in an acting capacity since August after Dan Coats stepped down. Maguire is obligated to leave the post by March 11 because federal law limits how long he can serve in the position in an acting capacity.
Trump appointed U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell to replace Maguire earlier this week. Grenell said Thursday that Trump won’t nominate him to serve as the intelligence chief permanently.
The president floated Georgia Rep. Doug Collins as a contender to fill the position on Thursday, but Collins said he would not accept the nomination.
"This is not a job that interests me. At this time, it's not one that I would accept because I'm running a Senate race down here in Georgia,” Collins said Friday during an interview with Mornings with Maria on Fox Business Network.
Utah Rep. Chris Stewart is said to be a top contender, according to the New York Times. National security adviser Robert O’Brien has encouraged Trump to nominate Stewart, who is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and is interested in the position.

Texto completo: Two days after Valentine’s Day, love was still in the air when President Trump motorcaded five blocks to attend the wedding of two senior aides, policy adviser Stephen Miller and vice presidential spokeswoman Katie Waldman.
Looking at the newlyweds who got hitched at the Trump International Hotel, the president gave a full-throated endorsement — and said he wants more like it.
“I think it’s great to fall in love in the White House,” he said, pointedly shrugging off corporate rules against employee dating.
“Look, they fell in love in the White House, and I think it’s great. Fall in love in the White House. It’s a great thing,” he said to the high-powered crowd at the Sunday night wedding, according to a guest.TweetThe Miller wedding was the latest in a handful of marriages in the Trump administration. But while the president’s critics, notably the New York Times, have sneered that Trump aides have to marry each other because the “dating pool is small” in liberal Washington, their marriage actually follows a long pattern in the White House.
“Where else are you going to meet somebody when we work so many hours,” said a Trump aide. The aide cited to a second driver: “We have shared values.”
Another top Trump aide close to the couple told us, “The president creates such an atmosphere of joy in the White House that we love working there, and we get deep and meaningful bonds, whether it be friendship or something more. We genuinely have a great time.”
Former Trump communications aide Mercedes Schlapp met her husband, American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, in the George W. Bush White House and attributed the insider environment to the marriages that result.
Tweet
“What happens is that you are kind of in the trenches, so you are making these lifetime friendships because you have experienced so much together,” said Schlapp, who has been married for 18 years.
“In some cases, it is making friendships, in others, it’s finding your future spouse,” she said. “You are in the battlefields with your colleagues, and from it comes long-lasting friendships,” she added, pointing to their relationships with several former Bush aides, notably Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his wife Ashley, who also met in the Bush White House.
Tweet
And that’s the story of Stephen and Katie Miller. They were phone associates during the early days when he was developing immigration policy and she was a key Homeland Security spokeswoman.
They were introduced by friends in early 2018, and when she shifted over to the White House to work for Vice President Mike Pence, the relationship grew because they shared similar values, said a friend.
At the ceremony, guests including Schlapp, Pence and his wife Karen, Sen. Steve Daines and his wife, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, top Trump aide Jared Kushner, former Republican Party chief Reince Priebus, and national security adviser Robert O’Brien didn't know what to expect.
Rabbi Aryeh Lightstone, who flew in from Israel for the ceremony, helped to break the ice when he said, “Welcome to Stephen Miller’s wedding. Katie and I are happy to be here.”
Schlapp said Miller in his vows showed a side few have seen from the fierce defender of the president. “We got to see Stephen in a whole different light, opening up his heart and sharing his admiration and love of Katie. There were so many of us who were crying.”
Schlapp said she ribbed her husband, who is organizing this month’s Conservative Political Action Conference, and asked, “When are you going to write me some beautiful vows like that?”

Ex-CIA Director John Brennan: Ouster of spy chief a 'virtual decapitation' of intelligence community

Texto completo: Former CIA director John Brennan said he is worried about the intelligence community following the ouster of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.
President Trump announced on Wednesday that Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, would replace Maguire as acting DNI. Critics say he lacks sufficient intelligence experience and is too close to Trump.
In a Friday morning appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Brennan called the personnel move "a virtual decapitation of the intelligence community" and suggested that intelligence professionals should "see this as yet one more example that they are not being allowed to do their job."
Brennan, who worked under three Democratic and three Republican administrations, also claimed the Trump administration does not "want the intelligence community to do its work — to the executive branch as well as to the legislative branch. But what we’re seeing now is such an anomaly, such an aberration from what we have seen in the past, about the importance of the independence of the intelligence community."
There have been reports that Maguire was forced out of his position as a result of one of his aides, Shelby Pierson, giving a classified briefing to the House Intelligence Committee about Russian interference in the 2020 election. During the briefing, which took place last week, the committee was informed that Russia is trying to interfere in the upcoming presidential election in order to get Trump reelected.
The acting deputy to Maguire, Andrew Hallman, will step down on Friday, according to the New York Times.

AOC endorses wave of liberal women in quest for 'progressive majority in Congress'

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's "squad" could get a lot bigger with the wave of female congressional candidates she endorsed on Friday.
The socialist surprised many by defeating Rep. Joe Crowley, a high-ranking incumbent, in a primary race in New York in 2018. Now, she’s looking to find more women to follow in her footsteps to replace centrist incumbents with younger, more liberal candidates.
After teasing a "big announcement" late Thursday, the 30-year-old congresswoman revealed the slate of candidates she is supporting with her political action committee Courage to Change as they primary Democratic incumbents throughout the United States. Ocasio-Cortez also revealed she is backing a few liberal candidates who are facing off against establishment picks for races that do not have a Democratic incumbent, such as the Senate race in Texas.
"It’s time to elect a progressive majority in Congress accountable to strong, grassroots movements that push support for issues like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, racial justice, & more," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. "It’s time to elect public servants with the Courage to Change."
Tweet
“One of our primary goals is to reward political courage in Congress and also to help elect a progressive majority in the House of Representatives,” Ocasio-Cortez told the New York Times. “There’s kind of a dual nature to this: One is opening the door to newcomers, and the other is to reward members of Congress that are exhibiting very large amounts of political courage.”
Ocasio-Cortez said she does not view this as a symbolic effort to back liberal candidates. “One of the things that is really important to us is winning," she said.
“It’s important for us to create mechanisms of support because so much of what is happening in Washington is driven by fear of loss,” Ocasio-Cortez explained. “We can really create an ecosystem that makes people more comfortable into making the leap to make politically courageous choices.”
The congresswoman chose races throughout the country and did not focus on just one region or type of state. Some of the centrist Democrats Ocasio-Cortez is hoping to oust include Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, Illinois Rep. Daniel Lipinski, and Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon. Many of these congressmen hold views Ocasio-Cortez opposes. They include Lipinski, who opposes abortion, and Cuellar, who has one of the highest ratings from the National Rifle Association.
In a fundraising pitch, Courage to Change condemned the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for valuing wealthy candidates rather than candidates that carry liberal values. The group said, “When community leaders, activists, and working-class candidates try to run for office, organizations like the D.C.C.C. discourage them. These potential progressive leaders are asked: ‘Can you raise $300,000 from your friends and family? If not, don’t bother trying.’”
Ocasio-Cortez raised $1.4 million for her campaign in January alone. Despite her influence, the congressman admitted she feels lonely in the position and wants more liberal members to join her in Congress as she reshapes the Democratic Party.
“While I think sometimes a lot of people see this as a huge amassing of influence or power or money or what have you, my personal experience does not feel that way — it can feel very lonely,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I think my ambition right now is to be a little less lonely in Congress.”
Ocasio-Cortez has openly criticized the Democratic Party since taking office. After she endorsed Bernie Sanders for the 2020 presidential race, she argued that she and Joe Biden would not even be in the same political party if they lived in another country. She claimed the party has “too big of a tent.”

Russia is said to be interfering to aid Sanders in Democratic primaries

Texto completo: Washington • Russia has been trying to intervene in the Democratic primaries to aid Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., according to people familiar with the matter, and intelligence officials recently briefed him about Russian interference in the election, Sanders said Friday.
In a statement Friday, Sanders denounced Russia, calling President Vladimir Putin an “autocratic thug” and warning Moscow to stay out of the election.
“Let’s be clear, the Russians want to undermine American democracy by dividing us up and, unlike the current president, I stand firmly against their efforts and any other foreign power that wants to interfere in our election,” Sanders said.
He also told reporters that he was briefed about a month ago.
“The intelligence community is telling us Russia is interfering in this campaign right now in 2020,” Sanders said Friday in Bakersfield, California, where he was to hold a rally ahead of Saturday’s Nevada caucuses. “And what I say to Mr. Putin, ‘If I am elected president, trust me you will not be interfering in American elections.’”

Senior intelligence officials told members of the House Intelligence Committee last week that Russia was continuing its election sabotage campaign, including intervening in the Democratic primaries.
Intelligence officials also warned House lawmakers that Russia was interfering in the campaign to try to get President Donald Trump reelected, according to people familiar with the matter. They said that the disclosure to Congress angered Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.
Republicans have taken issue with the idea that Russia supports Trump, insisting that Putin simply wants to broadly spread chaos and undermine the democratic system. But some current and former officials say that a Russian campaign to support Sanders may ultimately be aimed at aiding Trump, with Moscow potentially considering Sanders a weaker opponent for the president than a more moderate Democratic nominee.
The Washington Post first reported the briefing of the Sanders campaign.
Sanders said it was his understanding that the Russians were against trying to interfere in the campaign. Some “ugly stuff on the internet” had been attributed to his campaign that could be coming from falsified accounts, he said.
The Russians also worked to support — or at least not harm — Sanders in 2016. Operatives at a Russian intelligence-backed troll factory were instructed to avoid attacking Sanders or Trump, according to the report by special counsel Robert Mueller. The report quoted internal documents from the Internet Research Agency ordering operatives to attack Hillary Clinton’s campaign. “Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest except for Sanders and Trump — we support them,” the document said.

Report: Trump dumped Chris Stewart for spy chief after learning he once called the president ‘Our Mussolini’

Texto completo: President Donald Trump apparently was set to appoint Utah Rep. Chris Stewart as his new director of national intelligence. Then someone told him how Stewart had called him “our Mussolini” back in 2016 — and the deal was off.
That’s according to a Bloomberg News story about tensions between Trump and intelligence agencies that told Congress that Russia is continuing to interfere with U.S. elections.
“Trump was close to nominating Representative Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican, as director of national intelligence, according to two people familiar with the deliberations," the story says. "But that idea was scrapped when Trump learned of a 2016 video clip in which Stewart said ‘Donald Trump does not represent Republican ideals, he is our Mussolini.’”
That, of course, is a reference to Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator who led Italy before and during World War II.
[ Read more: Chris Stewart: Moscow has ‘no reason’ to support Trump in 2020 ]
Stewart made those comments to University of Utah students in 2016 at a time when he was backing Marco Rubio for president. Two years later he said he was joking.
In 2018 after telling CNN, “I love this president” referring to Trump, Stewart said he was jesting in making that remark and the earlier Mussolini comment. “Both of them were tongue-in-cheek,” he told The Salt Lake Tribune. "Obviously I’m not declaring my love for the president.”
Like many elected Republicans, Stewart has embraced the president and he’s now serving as a co-chairman of Trump’s 2020 reelection effort in Utah. Stewart was a loyal defender of the president throughout the impeachment proceedings.
The New York Times reported earlier this week that Stewart was among Republican who challenged intelligence officers’ conclusion in closed-door briefings that Russia was supporting the president.
“Stewart insisted that Trump has aggressively confronted Moscow, providing antitank weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russia-backed separatists and strengthening the NATO alliance with new resources, according to two people briefed on the meeting,” it said.
The newspaper added that Stewart declined to discuss the briefing, but said, “I’d challenge anyone to give me a real-world argument where Putin would rather have President Trump and not Bernie Sanders.”
The New York Times also had earlier reported that Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, had been pushing Stewart for the position, which would have put him in charge of 17 intelligence agencies.
Stewart’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday about the Bloomberg story.

Texto completo: Wednesday’s Democratic debate was far more informative than previous debates. What we learned, in particular, was that as a presidential candidate, Michael Bloomberg is a great businessman — and that Elizabeth Warren remains a force to be reckoned with.
Both lessons ran very much counter to the narrative that the news media has been telling in recent weeks. On one side, there has been a palpable eagerness on the part of some news organizations and many pundits to elevate Bloomberg; on the other side, complaints by Warren supporters about her “erasure” from news coverage and polling aren’t wrong.
What does all this mean for the nomination? I have no idea. But maybe the Warren-Bloomberg confrontation will help refocus discussion away from so-called Medicare for All — which isn’t going to be enacted, no matter who wins — to an issue where it matters a lot which Democrat prevails. Namely, are we going to do anything to rein in the financialization of the U.S. economy?
During the U.S. economy’s greatest generation — the era of rapid, broadly shared growth that followed World War II — Wall Street was a fairly peripheral part of the picture. When people thought about business leaders, they thought about people running companies that actually made things, not people who got rich through wheeling and dealing.
But that all changed in the 1980s, largely thanks to financial deregulation. Suddenly the big bucks came from buying and selling companies as opposed to running them.
In many cases, these financial deals saddled companies with crippling levels of debt, often ending in bankruptcy and job destruction — a process that continues to this day. There was also an epidemic of financial fraud and racketeering, exemplified by the career of Michael Milken, the junk-bond king Donald Trump just pardoned.
And the financial sector itself doubled as a share of the economy, which meant that it was pulling lots of capital and many smart people away from productive activities.
For there is no evidence that Wall Street’s mega-expansion made the rest of the economy more efficient. On the contrary, growth in family incomes slowed down as finance rose — although a few people became immensely rich. And the runaway growth of finance set the stage for the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
It also made Michael Bloomberg a billionaire.
Now, I wasn’t being sarcastic in calling Bloomberg a great businessman. He is. And to his credit, he himself hasn’t, as far as I know, engaged in destructive financial wheeling and dealing. Instead, he got rich by selling equipment to destructive wheeler-dealers.
For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, I’m referring to the famous Bloomberg Terminal, a proprietary computer system that gives subscribers real-time access to large quantities of financial data. This access is incredibly expensive — a subscription costs around $24,000 a year. But it’s a must-have in the financial industry, because traders with Bloomberg Terminals can react to market events a few minutes faster than those without.
It’s an extremely profitable business. But is it good for the economy? No.
After all, does getting financial information a few minutes earlier do anything significant to improve real-world business decisions that affect jobs and productivity? Surely not. Bloomberg has, in effect, made his billions off a financial arms race that costs vast sums but leaves everyone pretty much back where they started.
Which brings me to Elizabeth Warren.
Warren stumbled badly, making herself a long shot for the nomination, by trying to appease supporters of Bernie Sanders. She endorsed proposals for radical health care reform that have almost no chance of becoming reality, and she was raked over the coals about paying for those proposals even though Sanders himself has offered few clues about his own plans.
But before all that, Warren had made a name for herself as a crusader against financial industry fraud and excess.
It wasn’t just talk. One key piece of the reforms instituted after the 2008 financial crisis, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was Warren’s brainchild. Furthermore, by all accounts the bureau was wildly successful, saving ordinary families billions, until the Trump administration set about eviscerating it.
And here’s the thing: Financial reform, unlike health care, is an area in which it might make a big difference which Democrat becomes president. It’s true that other candidates — including Bloomberg! — have endorsed Warren-type reforms. But it is, I think, fair to ask how committed they would be in practice, and also whether they would squander their political capital on unwinnable fights, which is my big concern about Sanders.
Again, aside from the clear damage to Bloomberg, I have no idea how or if Wednesday’s debate will affect the Democratic race. But it may have helped remind Democrats that corruption, fraud and the excesses of Wall Street in particular can be potent political issues — especially against a president who is both personally corrupt and so obviously a friend to fraudsters.

Texto completo: Successful presidential candidates are mythmakers. They don’t just tell a story. They tell a story that helps people make meaning out of the current moment; that divides people into heroes and villains; that names a central challenge and explains why they are the perfect person to meet it.
In 2016 Donald Trump told a successful myth: The coastal elites are greedy, stupid people who have mismanaged the country, undermined our values and changed the face of our society. This was not an original myth; it’s been around since at least the populist revolts of the 1890s. But it’s a powerful us vs. them worldview, which resonates with a lot of people.
Trump’s followers don’t merely believe that myth. They inhabit it. It shapes how they see the world, how they put people into this category or that category. Trump can get his facts wrong as long as he gets his myth right. He can commit a million scandals, but his followers don’t see them as long as they stay embedded within that myth.
Bernie Sanders is also telling a successful myth: The corporate and Wall Street elites are rapacious monsters who hoard the nation’s wealth and oppress working families. This is not an original myth, either. It’s been around since the class-conflict agitators of 1848. It is also a very compelling us vs. them worldview that resonates with a lot of people.
When you’re inside the Sanders myth, you see the world through the Bernie lens.
For example, if you look at Mike Bloomberg through a certain lens you see a successful entrepreneur who took his management skills into public service and then started giving his wealth away to reduce gun violence and climate change. If, on the other hand, you look at Bloomberg through the Bernie lens you see a rapacious billionaire who amassed a gross amount of wealth, who became an authoritarian mayor and targeted young black men and then tried to buy his way to power.
Same person through different lenses.
My takeaway from Wednesday’s hellaciously entertaining Democratic debate is that Sanders is the only candidate telling a successful myth. Bloomberg, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar all make good arguments, but they haven’t organized their worldview into a simple compelling myth. You may look at them, but you don’t see the world through their eyes.
Elizabeth Warren inhabits a myth without expressing it clearly. It just happens to be Sanders’ myth. I thought her performance Wednesday evening was tactically brilliant and strategically catastrophic. Her attack on Bloomberg was totally through the Bernie lens. Her attacks on Buttigieg and Klobuchar were also through the Bernie lens. (Through that lens a bigger spending proposal is always better than a less big spending proposal.)
Warren was a devastatingly effective surrogate for Sanders, but she reinforced his worldview rather than establishing one of her own.
Over the past five years Sanders and his fellow progressives have induced large parts of the Democratic Party to see through the Bernie lens. You can tell because every candidate on that stage has the categories and mental equipment to carve up a billionaire like Bloomberg. None have the categories or mental equipment to take down a socialist like Sanders.
Sanders goes untouched in these debates because the other candidates don’t have a mythic platform from which to launch an attack. Saying his plans cost too much is a pathetic response to a successful myth.
I’ve spent much of this election season away from the campaign rallies and interviewing voters embedded in their normal lives. This week, for example, I was in Compton and Watts in and around Los Angeles. The reality I encounter every day has little to do with the us vs. them stories Trump and Sanders are telling.
Everywhere I go I see systems that are struggling — school systems, housing systems, family structures, neighborhoods trying to bridge diversity. These problems aren’t caused by some group of intentionally evil people. They exist because living through a time of economic, technological, demographic and cultural transition is hard. Creating social trust across diversity is hard.
Everywhere I go I see a process that is the opposite of group vs. group war. It is gathering. It is people becoming extra active on the local level to repair the systems in their lives. I see a great yearning for solidarity, an eagerness to come together and make practical change.
These gathering efforts are hampered by rippers at the national level who stoke rage and fear and tell friend/enemy stories. These efforts are hampered by men like Sanders and Trump who have never worked within a party or subordinated themselves to a team — men who are one-trick ponies. All they do is stand on a podium and bellow.
In the gathering myth, the heroes have traits Trump and Sanders lack: open-mindedness, flexibility, listening skills, team-building skills and basic human warmth. In this saga, leaders are measured by their ability to expand relationships, not wall them off.
The gathering myth is an alternative myth — one that has the advantage of being true.

Texto completo: Two children who lived in Idaho — Tylee Ryan, 17, and Joshua Vallow, 7 — have been missing for months.
The story of their disappearance is part of a larger tale that has drawn national and international headlines and involves at least three people dead, the two missing children and open police investigations in multiple states.
At the center of it all are the children’s mother, Lori Vallow, 46, and her new husband, Chad Daybell, 51 — a couple whose religious doomsday beliefs have isolated them from their families, their relatives said.
Vallow was arrested in Hawaii on Thursday, police on Kauai said, on a warrant issued by authorities in Idaho. She faces charges that include two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children, resisting or obstructing officers, contempt of court and criminal solicitation to commit a crime.
Vallow and Daybell married shortly after both of their former spouses died: Vallow’s husband was shot, and Daybell’s wife’s cause of death remains unknown. Authorities have said that Vallow did not cooperate to help find the missing children.
The newlyweds were then found together — without the children — in Hawaii.
What happened in Arizona, Idaho and Hawaii?
Last year, multiple people who were related or married to Vallow or Daybell were either killed or found dead.
In July, Vallow’s brother, Alexander Cox, called 911 to say that he had shot Charles Vallow, his sister’s estranged husband, at her home in Chandler, Arizona.
According to body camera footage from police officers who responded to his call, Cox said that he had been visiting his sister when her husband, who had been living in Texas, came to see the children.
Cox said that he had witnessed an altercation between his sister and her husband and that she had left the home. Then, Cox said, he got into an argument with her husband, who hit him on the head with a baseball bat.
Cox said that he retrieved his handgun from his room and shot his sister’s husband in self-defense. Charles Vallow died. No arrests were made, but the case remains under investigation, police in Chandler said.
On Oct. 19, Daybell’s wife, Tammy Daybell, 49, was found dead in her home in Salem, Idaho. Authorities said that she appeared to have died of natural causes, and she was buried in Springville, Utah, where she once lived.
Chad Daybell married Vallow the next month, and she moved to Idaho.
But Tammy Daybell’s body was exhumed Dec. 11 after authorities in Idaho began to question the circumstances of her death and whether it might have been connected to the disappearances of Tylee and Joshua.
The Fremont County Sheriff’s Office in Idaho, which is investigating her death, is waiting for autopsy results.
On Dec. 12, Cox, Vallow’s brother, was found dead in his home in Gilbert, Arizona, according to police there. It remains unclear how he died.
“We are currently awaiting for the autopsy results to come back,” a department spokeswoman said in a statement. “We anticipate it’ll be another two months or so for us to receive those results.”
Vallow and Daybell eventually turned up in Hawaii but without the children, and in late January, the Kauai Police Department said it had served her with a court order to bring her children to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.
The deadline came and went, but neither Vallow nor her children appeared.
On Thursday, Kauai police said they had arrested Vallow in Princeville and that she would attend a hearing on the island, “where she will have an opportunity to waive or fight her extradition to Idaho.”
Police said that she faced no criminal charges on Kauai and was being held with bail set at $5 million. Daybell was not arrested.
Was a religious organization involved?
Relatives of Vallow and Daybell have suggested that the couple’s religious beliefs isolated them from their family members.
Daybell is the author of several books with religious themes, and both he and Vallow have been linked to an entity called Preparing a People.
A multimedia company, Color My Media, said in a statement that “Preparing a People” was essentially a lecture series. “It is not a ‘group’ and is not a ‘cult’ or something people join,” it said.
The website said it aims to help prepare people for the second coming of Jesus Christ, and the statement made reference to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It added that Daybell and Vallow had both appeared on podcasts associated with the organization but were not considered leaders.
Vallow’s religious beliefs were also mentioned in court documents when her former husband had filed for a divorce from her about five months before he died.
The filings were obtained by Fox 10, a news outlet in Phoenix, which reported that the documents showed that he claimed that Vallow believed she was “receiving spiritual revelations and visions to help her gather and prepare those chosen to live in the New Jerusalem after the Great War as prophesied in the Book of Revelations.”
Steve Ellsworth, a lawyer who represented Vallow when he filed for divorce, confirmed the accuracy of the Fox 10 report. (The divorce was never finalized.)
Where are the children?
It remains unclear where Tylee and Joshua are and whether they are alive.
Rexburg police conducted a wellness check on Joshua on Nov. 26. They did not find him. They returned with a search warrant the next day and found that Vallow and Daybell had left Rexburg, Idaho.
“We have taken every step available to us, including executing multiple search warrants, interviewing multiple sources and running down every lead we have found,” Rexburg police said in a statement Dec. 30. “We strongly believe that Joshua and Tylee’s lives are in danger.”
“We want them back,” said Larry Woodcock, a grandparent of Joshua, at a news conference last month. He added that Vallow was a good mother to the children when they were younger.
“If somebody two years ago would have said this is what’s going to happen with Lori, I would never have believed it,” he said.
Authorities have said that Joshua’s relatives have not heard from him since September, that Daybell once falsely claimed that Tylee had died more than a year ago, and that Vallow once falsely claimed that Joshua was staying with a family friend in Arizona.
“We know that the children are not with Lori and Chad Daybell, and we also have information indicating that Lori knows either the location of the children or what has happened to them,” the police statement said.
In early February, The East Idaho News reported that Vallow abandoned a storage unit she had rented on Oct. 1 at Self Storage Plus in Rexburg.
The news outlet shared security footage from the storage company, which appeared to show Vallow and two other men — possibly Cox and Daybell — visiting the unit multiple times in October and November to bring or remove items.
Self Storage Plus confirmed in a statement that it had rented a storage unit to Vallow. An owner of the business confirmed that authorities had searched the unit Nov. 27 and that it contained children’s items, including photographs, bicycles and clothing.
Sean Bartholick, a lawyer for Vallow — who may have changed her last name to Daybell — and Chad Daybell declined to comment on the case in early February but issued a statement on their behalf to The East Idaho News in December.
“Chad Daybell was a loving husband and has the support of his children in this matter,” it said. “Lori Daybell is a devoted mother and resents assertions to the contrary. We look forward to addressing the allegations once they have moved beyond speculation and rumor.”
Colby Ryan, Vallow’s older son from a previous marriage, expressed his frustration with the murky situation and urged his mother to “do the right thing” in a video posted in late January.
Ryan said he loved his siblings and wanted to see them.
“I just hope everything can work out really soon,” Ryan said. “I hope everything can turn back around and we can be together again. I want that. I miss our family.”

Texto completo: Back in the 1800s, the expression “pull oneself up by the bootstraps” meant the opposite of what it does now. Then it was used mockingly to describe an impossible act.
An 1834 publication ridiculed a claim to have built a perpetual-motion machine by saying that the inventor might next heave himself over a river “by the straps of his boots.” An 1840 citation scoffs that something is “as gross an absurdity as he who attempts to raise himself over a fence by the straps of his boots.”
Yet this phrase has become part of America’s mythology and the centerpiece of our approach to help those left behind: We harangue them to lift themselves up by the bootstraps. When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this month dismissed bootstrapping at a congressional hearing as “physically impossible,” outrage reverberated across the conservative media world.
Sean Hannity’s blog said that her assertion “left millions of television viewers scratching their heads.” Another Fox News commentator said that Ocasio-Cortez was “completely clueless.”
So let’s think this through.
It’s true that upward mobility has always resonated deeply in the United States. My father, a refugee from Romania and Ukraine, came to the United States because to him it symbolized opportunity (and, sure enough, it provided him rich opportunities).
Some people do manage heroic journeys to the top. Ben Carson grew up as an impoverished black child of a single mother in Detroit and became a pediatric neurosurgeon and secretary of housing and urban development. Bravo to him.
The problem is that this bootstraps narrative drives out good policy in three ways.
First, it suggests that historically Americans rose purely through rugged individualism — think of the pioneers!
Ah, but why did the pioneers go west? Because of government benefit programs that granted them homesteads! Ten percent of America’s land was given out as homesteads, and perhaps one-quarter of Americans (almost all of them white) owe part of their family wealth to the homestead acts.
Then there was the American investment in free high schools and in state colleges and universities, plus gigantic programs like rural electrification and the GI Bill of Rights. In short, even when we were a much poorer nation, we were able to afford huge national investments to help disadvantaged (white) Americans, because they were a priority.
Second, the bootstraps narrative often suggests that benefits programs are counterproductive because they foster “dependency.” That may have been a plausible argument a generation ago, but the evidence now indicates that it is incorrect.
Europe and Canada have much more robust social welfare systems than the United States, but Americans in the prime working years (ages 25 to 54) are more likely to drop out of the labor force than Europeans and Canadians in those years. Americans drop out of the labor force primarily because we do worse than other countries of investing in workers’ education, health care, addiction treatment and job training.
Third, the bootstraps narrative implies that everyone can pull a Ben Carson (Carson himself falls for this fallacy). This is like arguing that because some people can run a four-minute mile, everyone can.
Yes, some Americans soar from humble beginnings; more often, the top is occupied by those who, say, were earning $200,000 a year at age 3, in today’s money, as President Donald Trump was. Some research finds that upward mobility has tumbled in the United States over the last half-century and is now lower than in Europe.
It’s particularly hard for people to scramble up when they come from violent homes, poor schools or foster care, or face impediments of race or class. These can be challenges, but they can be addressed to some extent — but not by sermons about bootstraps.
I received a note the other day from a carpenter in Washington State, Mike Stimac, about these issues. He grew up in a small town and describes himself as “more conservative than liberal,” but he had read a new book that my wife and I wrote about Americans left behind, and he responded: “I had two parents who gave me a home, no alcohol or physical abuse. I always felt like we were just making it. My parents were blue collar (machinist, sawmill operator, seamstress, cafeteria cook). I never felt like I was privileged, but I see now that I was. …
“Being a carpenter and general contractor, here again I felt I ‘pulled myself up by my bootstraps.’ My wife and I made a living with hard work and family help and now have a fairly strong financial standing. But now I realize it is more than hard work and family help. I was privileged to have two parents who valued education (though they never went to college), I am white, and there was no abuse.”
Stimac says he now favors substantial federal programs to provide opportunity and address addiction, mental illness and education, adding, “This is a real change of heart for me.”
That change of heart is what we need for our country as a whole. American children need fewer wagging fingers or homilies about bootstraps, and more helping hands.

Texto completo: Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Donald Trump reelected, five people familiar with the matter said, in a disclosure that angered Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.
The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant.
During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Trump's allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that Trump has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans.
That intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced Wednesday that he was replacing Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter.
Though some current and former officials speculated that the briefing may have played a role in the removal of Maguire, who had told people in recent days that he believed he would remain in the job, two administration officials said the timing was coincidental. Grenell had been in discussions with the administration about taking on new roles, they said, and Trump had never felt a personal kinship with Maguire.
Spokeswomen for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and its election security office declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A House Intelligence Committee official called the Feb. 13 briefing an important update about "the integrity of our upcoming elections" and said members of both parties attended, including Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee.
The Washington Post first reported the Oval Office confrontation between Trump and Maguire.
In another wrinkle to Grenell's appointment, he may hold the job of overseeing the nation's 17 spy agencies for about three weeks -- unless the White House quickly finds a permanent nominee to offer for confirmation.
According to people familiar with the administration's deliberations, Grenell agreed to hold the post for only a limited period of time.
Federal law gives Trump a great deal of flexibility to appoint whomever he chooses to the position on a temporary basis while his official nominee for the job awaits confirmation from the Senate. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Grenell can serve in his post only until March 11 unless the president formally nominates someone else for the job.
That move would allow Grenell to serve for months longer as the nomination works its way through the Senate. Two administration officials said that officials were aware that they must nominate someone else soon, and that the process to find a formal nominee was underway.
"The President will announce the Nominee (not me) sometime soon," Grenell wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning.
Even before his new appointment Wednesday, Grenell had been working with the White House on issues related to intelligence, including pressuring allies not to use the Chinese telecom company Huawei to build the next-generation mobile network known as 5G because of security concerns. He is not giving up his ambassadorship to Germany or a broader diplomatic portfolio that involves developing a rail path between Kosovo and Serbia.<

Pilot wheelies his way into the Guinness Book of World Records
Aviation historian, writer and pilot Christopher Freeze set a new Guinness World Record after touching down in a Victorville airport. Actually, to be precise, he wheelied down for the longest distance in history.
Guinness certified the Valentine's Day feat on Friday morning via email, Freeze said. At 14,391 feet, the "soft landing roll" crushed the previous record of 6,561 feet.
You might wonder how long such a distance takes to travel via wheelie: In this case, 3 minutes and 19 seconds.
“It was definitely a major balancing act,” said Freeze, who lives in Virginia but chose Victorville for its long commercial runway. “There were a lot of factors in keeping that nose up. Too slow and the nose drops — too fast and the plane starts to lift off. ”
Watch: The landing right here.
Coronavirus, quakes and Joaquin Phoenix's daring rescue

State goes to battle for a 'certain kind of 3-inch fish'
A day after President Trump signed new federal regulations that will send more water from critters and habitat to farmers, state Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced a lawsuit aimed at delaying implementation of the move.
“California won’t silently spectate as the Trump Administration adopts scientifically challenged biological opinions that push species to extinction and harm our natural resources and waterways,” Becerra said in a statement Thursday.
Adopting the new biological opinion, which found minimal enviro impact from the water transfer, fulfills a campaign promise Trump made during a stop to the region in 2016, during which he blasted limits on water delivery that protect “a certain kind of 3-inch fish. ”
“A major obstacle to providing more water for the region’s farmers has now been totally eliminated by the federal government,” Trump said in Bakersfield on Wednesday.

For low-income families, poor credit keeps doors closed
Many people struggling to find housing learn quickly enough that on top of hefty rent and scarce inventory, there will be another barrier: their credit scores.
Poor or no credit can lead to higher insurance rates and utility deposits, and people with poor credit can be denied jobs, loans and housing – even Section 8 housing. But one organization is hoping to alleviate this barrier with a program called "lending circles," a loan in which people pool their money to lend and borrow.
Lift to Rise, a Coachella Valley nonprofit that collects housing and poverty data to push policy change, launched a local lending circle program aimed at serving poor, minority residents in January. They're working with San Francisco-based Mission Asset Fund, a nonprofit that launched the concept in 2008.
Find out more about this program and how it could be a key to some people improving their credit scores and their lives.
The Berkeley economists touting a (controversial) wealth tax
The top tenth of 1 percent of Americans held 19. 3% of wealth in 2018 — that's triple the share compared to the compared to four decades earlier. The two Berkeley economists whose research led to that conclusion, Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, have suggested a controversial way to help level the playing field: a tax on the wealthy.
It's an idea embraced by Democratic presidential contenders Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders but not universally agreed upon by others in the field of economics.
“In terms of Democratic thinking, it’s been enormously influential, both in highlighting the issue of inequality — particularly how concentrated it is at the very top — and the way the tax system has been inadequate in combating that increase in inequality,” said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who was a chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.
Harvard University's Lawrence Summers, a former chairman of Obama’s National Economic Council, and Natasha Sarin, a University of Pennsylvania law school professor, challenged the pair's assumptions. They argue the tax would raise half of the $4 trillion Zucman and Saez project.
The New York Times took a closer look at the duo, who have spent their careers at the intersection of rising inequality and tax policy.
See Zucman's take on how Medicare for All would be funded and why the existing system amounts to a "crushing privatized poll tax. "
That's it for this week. See you on Monday!

Texto completo: You can buy ads and saturate the airwaves with them. You can buy allies, especially with the right budget.
But you can’t buy a debate performance, and that’s why Mike Bloomberg’s on Wednesday night mattered so much. This was the man talking, not the money.
And the man needed rescue — from his bloodthirsty rivals and even more so from himself.
Making his first appearance alongside other contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bloomberg knew that he would be under furious attack and had clearly resolved not to show any negative emotion. But that meant that he often showed no emotion at all. Or he looked vaguely bemused, and that didn’t communicate the coolness that he intended. It signaled an aloofness that he very much needed to avoid.
He made a groaner of a joke about his wealth, saying that he could hardly use a plebeian instrument like TurboTax to ready his tax returns for public consumption. He made light of past harassment-related complaints from female employees: “None of them accuse me of doing anything other than maybe they didn’t like a joke I told.”
He repeatedly — and laughably — suggested that he wouldn’t tear up nondisclosure agreements with women who have sued him or his company because they wanted the silence as much as he did. Elizabeth Warren hammered and hammered him on this point, but he wouldn’t budge, and that left the impression that he couldn’t budge. The truth would be too ugly.
Ugly: That’s the word for this ninth debate of the Democratic primary season. It had the fewest candidates — six — but the most nastiness, because those candidates clearly felt an urgency to diminish their competitors and elevate themselves before it was too late. A meager haul of votes in the Nevada caucuses this coming Saturday could effectively undo one or more of them; a poor showing on Super Tuesday less than two weeks from now would definitely be the end of the road.
So Pete Buttigieg went after Amy Klobuchar. Bernie Sanders went after Buttigieg. Joe Biden went after Sanders. Warren went after everybody, a Sherman tank bent on flattening everything in her path. And all of them went after Bloomberg. Dear God, how they went after Bloomberg. I’ve seen chum treated with more delicacy by great white sharks.
It’s no wonder they wanted a bite of him. It was the first time since Bloomberg announced his run for the presidency that he was within reach. For three high-spending, highflying months, he campaigned essentially as a phantasm, ubiquitous in television commercials but averse to interviews, a supposed paragon of electability who had yet to put himself before voters, more idea than actuality, able to be seen but not touched.
But on Wednesday night, that changed abruptly. The apparition became flesh. And it was bruised from the get-go and bloodied soon after.
Sanders fielded the opening question of the night and, within the first 15 seconds of his response, pivoted to a denunciation of Bloomberg’s stop-and-frisk policing policy, which focused on young men of color, when he was mayor of New York.
Warren quickly joined in, expanding the critique of Bloomberg to coarse, sexist comments he allegedly made about women. She quoted a few of those remarks without naming the source, then said: “I’m not talking about Donald Trump. I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.”
She likened Bloomberg to Trump in terms of not only his attitude toward women but also his lack of transparency about his taxes and policies of his that she described as racist. “Democrats take a huge risk,” she summarized, “if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.”
It was as if the candidates had made a private pact to eviscerate Bloomberg, who has spent hundreds of millions of his roughly $60 billion fortune to climb in the polls and is poised to spend hundreds of millions more before the nomination is decided.
Is he trying to purchase it? Absolutely. But, as he said at the debate, there’s a great cause behind that expenditure — his determination to deny Trump a second term — and his funding of his own presidential bid at least means he’s beholden to no one.
That logic didn’t impress the other candidates onstage, though Buttigieg arguably showed Bloomberg some mercy by denigrating him and Sanders together in one stroke. He called them “the two most polarizing figures on this stage,” one of whom thinks that “capitalism is the root of all evil” and the other of whom thinks that “money ought to be the root of all power.”
“We shouldn’t have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out,” Buttigieg said. “We can do better.”
That line was obviously scripted but no less fascinating for it, because it affirmed the nutty extent to which Bloomberg, by dint of financial swagger and aggressive public relations, has created the narrative that he is the obvious moderate alternative to Sanders and the most fearsome adversary for Trump. There’s no real proof yet of either. But it’s a notion with enough currency that Buttigieg, who actually leads the Democratic contest so far in terms of accrued delegates, felt the need to chip away at it.
Bloomberg sure seemed fearsome, at least before Wednesday night, and while money is a principal reason, it’s not the only one. Much of his 12-year record as a three-term mayor of America’s most populous city is commendable. He built his phenomenally successful business himself and, having done so, channeled a significant fraction of his wealth into philanthropy.
He mentioned all of that during the debate, albeit in a manner too rushed and too flat, so that the good of Bloomberg receded behind the awkward of Bloomberg — and Bloomberg can be awfully awkward. As someone who admires much about him, I found myself cringing again and again.
Maybe Bloomberg never stood a chance, not given how prepared his rivals were to tear him apart and the particular exuberance and eloquence that Warren brought to the task. She savaged him not only for his mistakes but for his explanations of those mistakes, so that his apologies were all but erased.
You thought there was acrimony between Warren and Sanders? They’re honeymooning sweethearts compared to her and Bloomberg.
But he was his own worst enemy. At one point he clumsily tried to paint Sanders as a hypocrite for espousing democratic socialism while being a millionaire and owning three houses himself. This wasn’t the pot calling the kettle black. This was a six-burner Wolf range calling the dorm-room hot plate a stove.
Sanders was the big winner of the night, because he entered the debate as the front-runner but evaded the kind of harsh treatment that a front-runner usually gets. Bloomberg got it instead.
So while Bloomberg warned direly that Sanders would be a disastrous nominee and possibly guarantee Trump’s victory, Bloomberg’s presence onstage may have bettered Sanders’ odds of getting to the general election. It certainly didn’t better Bloomberg’s.
There was another winner: Trump. The candidates flexed so much disdain for one another that they had a limited reserve for him, and I can imagine Trump and his advisers scouring the night’s transcripts for tips on how to take down whoever the eventual Democratic nominee is.
I don’t know how Democrats escape the uncomely chaos of their contest. But I do know that it’s not the ideal run-up to November, and Bloomberg’s billions aren’t magically going to make it all better.

Kristof: Pull yourself up by bootstraps? Go ahead, try it

Texto completo: Back in the 1800s, the expression “pull oneself up by the bootstraps” meant the opposite of what it does now. Then it was used mockingly to describe an impossible act.
An 1834 publication ridiculed a claim to have built a perpetual-motion machine by saying that the inventor might next heave himself over a river “by the straps of his boots.” An 1840 citation scoffs that something is “as gross an absurdity as he who attempts to raise himself over a fence by the straps of his boots.”
Yet this phrase has become part of America’s mythology and the centerpiece of our approach to help those left behind: We harangue them to lift themselves up by the bootstraps. When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this month dismissed bootstrapping at a congressional hearing as “physically impossible,” outrage reverberated across the conservative media world.
Sean Hannity’s blog said that her assertion “left millions of television viewers scratching their heads.” Another Fox News commentator said that Ocasio-Cortez was “completely clueless.”
So let’s think this through.
It’s true that upward mobility has always resonated deeply in the United States. My father, a refugee from Romania and Ukraine, came to the United States because to him it symbolized opportunity (and, sure enough, it provided him rich opportunities).
Some people do manage heroic journeys to the top. Ben Carson grew up as an impoverished black child of a single mother in Detroit and became a pediatric neurosurgeon and secretary of housing and urban development. Bravo to him.
The problem is that this bootstraps narrative drives out good policy in three ways.
First, it suggests that historically Americans rose purely through rugged individualism — think of the pioneers!
Ah, but why did the pioneers go west? Because of government benefit programs that granted them homesteads! Ten percent of America’s land was given out as homesteads, and perhaps one-quarter of Americans (almost all of them white) owe part of their family wealth to the homestead acts.
Then there was the American investment in free high schools and in state colleges and universities, plus gigantic programs like rural electrification and the GI Bill of Rights. In short, even when we were a much poorer nation, we were able to afford huge national investments to help disadvantaged (white) Americans, because they were a priority.
Second, the bootstraps narrative often suggests that benefits programs are counterproductive because they foster “dependency.” That may have been a plausible argument a generation ago, but the evidence now indicates that it is incorrect.
Europe and Canada have much more robust social welfare systems than the United States, but Americans in the prime working years (ages 25 to 54) are more likely to drop out of the labor force than Europeans and Canadians in those years. Americans drop out of the labor force primarily because we do worse than other countries of investing in workers’ education, health care, addiction treatment and job training.
Third, the bootstraps narrative implies that everyone can pull a Ben Carson (Carson himself falls for this fallacy). This is like arguing that because some people can run a four-minute mile, everyone can.
Yes, some Americans soar from humble beginnings; more often, the top is occupied by those who, say, were earning $200,000 a year at age 3, in today’s money, as President Donald Trump was. Some research finds that upward mobility has tumbled in the United States over the past half-century and is now lower than in Europe.
It’s particularly hard for people to scramble up when they come from violent homes, poor schools or foster care, or face impediments of race or class. These can be challenges, but they can be addressed to some extent — but not by sermons about bootstraps.
I received a note the other day from a carpenter in Washington state, Mike Stimac, about these issues. He grew up in a small town and describes himself as “more conservative than liberal,” but he had read a new book that my wife and I wrote about Americans left behind, and he responded: “I had two parents who gave me a home, no alcohol or physical abuse. I always felt like we were just making it. My parents were blue collar (machinist, sawmill operator, seamstress, cafeteria cook). I never felt like I was privileged, but I see now that I was. …
“Being a carpenter and general contractor, here again I felt I ‘pulled myself up by my bootstraps.’ My wife and I made a living with hard work and family help and now have a fairly strong financial standing. But now I realize it is more than hard work and family help. I was privileged to have two parents who valued education (though they never went to college), I am white, and there was no abuse.”
Stimac says he now favors substantial federal programs to provide opportunity and address addiction, mental illness and education, adding, “This is a real change of heart for me.”
That change of heart is what we need for our country as a whole. American children need fewer wagging fingers or homilies about bootstraps, and more helping hands.

Texto completo: When it comes to swag, whatever President Donald Trump is selling, his supporters are buying.
The latest Trump item to garner widespread interest comes from an auction house in South Jersey that is selling what it says is Trump's signature on a copy of the House's impeachment report.
Though it likely won't reach the $100,000 to $500,000 that Hardcore Pawn star Les Gold predicted a few weeks back, bidding on the signature has already reached $17,000. According to Ken Goldin, founder of Goldin Auctions in Runnemede, the signature is likely to sell for more than $40,000 or $50,000 by the time the auction closes on Saturday.
The president's signature is just one of a nearly endless list of items being sought by Trump supporters, who appear to have an insatiable appetite for merchandise promoting the 45th president. Goldin said he's auctioned many political items over the years, including some signed by former President Barack Obama, but nothing measures up to the demand he's seen for Trump items.
The demand for the document exists even though its authenticity has been called into question. Goldin says he obtained the autograph from a man named Jonathan Moore, who had it signed at a Trump rally in Battle Creek, Mich., on Dec. 18, the same day the House Judiciary Committee issued its impeachment report.
Tim Murtaugh, Trump campaign director of communications, expressed skepticism to the New York Times that the autographed items were "authentic as claimed." And Jeannie Burchfield, chairwoman of the Calhoun County Republican Party, told the Times that Jonathan Moore does not exist.
Goldin acknowledged that "Jonathan Moore" may be a pseudonym, but said two firms - Beckett Authentication Services and Professional Sports Authenticator - confirmed Trump's signature.
"I am cocksure this is signed by Trump," Goldin said. "I've sold over 60 of his items. I know the timeline. I know who got it signed. And I'm extremely comfortable with it."
While registered Democrats far outnumber Republicans in Philadelphia, the desire for presidential merch certainly exists in the suburbs, where Mike Domanico opened a new "Trump Store" in Bensalem just last week. Domanico said business has been so brisk, he had planned to open a second store in the Willow Grove Mall but is now looking at strip-mall locations in Montgomery County after he says the mall backed out of the deal.
Willow Grove Mall did not respond to a request for comment.
"Last Saturday, we had a line out the door," Domanico said.
He's part of a cottage industry that has grown during Trump's first term to meet the overwhelming demand for merchandise featuring the president and his policies. His store and others like it sell merchandise unaffiliated with Trump's campaign, running the gamut from shirts to commemorative coins and just about everything in between, including a Trump wig for your dog.
But if Trump is known for one thing, it's slapping his name on something and selling it. Previous presidents, such as Obama, sold their fair share of branded merchandise to raise money or awareness for their political campaigns. And Obama was similarly featured on a fair share of vendors' merchandise.
But Trump and his campaign staff appear especially adept at tapping into the anger and sense of grievance felt by his supporters, who proudly wear his now-iconic "Make America Great Again" hat and buy merchandise as much out of defiance toward Democrats and liberals as a show of support for the president.
In July, Trump's campaign quickly sold out of plastic Trump straws, marketed as a response to the growth of environmentally friendly paper straws. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale got the idea after he was annoyed the paper straw he was using on a JetBlue flight ripped.
So why is Trump memorabilia, either sold directly by the campaign or through stores like the ones Domanico owns or auctions that Goldin hosts, able to generate such interest from consumers?
According to Bruce Newman, a political marketing specialist and professor at Driehaus College of Business at DePaul University in Chicago, it's about the strong connection Trump has created with his supporters. "I think Trump is such a divisive personality, he brings out the best and the worst in people. He elicits that kind of emotion from people," he said.

WASHINGTON - Victoria Coates, a top
Official on the National Security Council, is
Being reassigned amid fallout over the identity of the author of the inside-the-White House tell-all book by "Anonymous."
Coates, who serves as national security adviser for the Middle East and North Africa,will be joining the Department of Energy as a senior adviser to Secretary Dan Brouillette, the NSC announced Thursday.
The move comes amid renewed speculation about the author of the book, "A Warning," and a New York Times essay that were deeply critical of President Donald Trump, written under the pen name "Anonymous."
But a senior administration official insisted the move had nothing to do with the speculation, saying top White House officials reject rumors that have circulated in recent weeks suggesting Coates is the author. The move, they said, has been in the works for several weeks.
"We are enthusiastic about adding
Dr. Coates to DOE, where her expertise on the Middle East and national security policy will be helpful," Brouillette said in a statement.
"She will play an important role on our team."
"While I'm sad to lose an important member of our team, Victoria will be a big asset to Secretary Brouillette as he executes the President's energy security policy priorities," Robert C. O'Brien, who leads the NSC, added.

Texto completo: BY MARY CLARE JALONICK
And MICHAEL BALSAMO
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election campaign to help President Donald Trump get re-elected, two officials familiar with the closed-door briefing said Thursday.
The warning raises questions about the integrity of the presidential campaign and whether Trump's administration is taking the proper steps to combat the kind of interference that the U.S. saw in 2016.
The officials asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. One of the officials said the briefing last week focused on Russia's efforts to influence the 2020 election and sow discord in the American electorate.
The warning was first reported by The New York Times and The Washington Post. The Times said the news infuriated Trump, who complained that Democrats would use the information against him. Over the course of his presidency, Trump has dismissed the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's 2016 election interference as a conspiracy to undermine his victory.
One day after the Feb. 13 briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Trump berated the then-director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and he announced this week that Maguire would be replaced by Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist.
U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the 2016 election through social media campaigns and stealing and distributing emails from Democratic accounts. They say Russia was trying to boost Trump's campaign and add chaos to the American political process. Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russian interference was "sweeping and systematic," but he did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.
In last week's briefing before House lawmakers, Trump's allies challenged the DNI's chief election official, Shelby Pierson, who delivered the conclusions, saying Trump has been tough on Russia, the Times reported. But Trump has also spoken warmly of Russian leader Vladimir Putin and withdrawn troops from areas, including Syria, where Moscow could fill the vacuum. He delayed military aid last year to Ukraine, a Russian adversary - a decision that was at the core of his impeachment proceedings.
The Times said Trump was angry that the House briefing was made before the panel's chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, who led the impeachment proceedings.
Trump on Thursday formally appointed Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, to replace Maguire as the new acting director of national intelligence. Maguire was required to step down soon under federal law governing acting appointments. The Times cited two administration officials as saying the timing, after the intelligence briefing, was coincidental.
Pierson told NPR in an interview that aired last month that the Russians "are already engaging in influence operations relative to candidates going into 2020. But we do not have evidence at this time that our adversaries are directly looking at interfering with vote counts or the vote tallies."
Pierson, appointed in July 2019 by then-Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, works with intelligence agencies, including the CIA, the FBI, the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security, to identify anyone seeking to interfere with U.S. elections.
Pierson told NPR that the U.S. doesn't know exactly what the Russians are planning, but she said it's not just a Russia problem.
"We're still also concerned about China, Iran, non-state actors, hacktivists and frankly - certainly for DHS and FBI - even Americans that might be looking to undermine confidence in the elections."
At an open hearing this month, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Judiciary Committee that Russia was engaged in "information warfare" heading into the November election, but that law enforcement had not seen efforts to target America's infrastructure. He said Russia is relying on a covert social media campaign to divide the American public.

Getting to the heart of Bernie Sanders' health

Texto completo: After his heart attack last October, Senator Bernie Sanders said, “The American people have a right to know whether the person they're going to be voting for for president is healthy. And we will certainly release our medical records before the primaries. It will certainly be before the first votes are cast."
Four months later, there's been a caucus in Iowa and a primary in New Hampshire. Votes have been cast. And Sanders still hasn't delivered the “comprehensive" medical records he once promised — nor does he intend to.
During a CNN town hall Tuesday, the Democratic presidential candidate was asked whether he would release more of his medical records. “I don't think we will, no," he said. At the Las Vegas debate, when asked “What happened to your promise of full transparency?," Sanders talked about the two stents he received last fall, and having released his medical history during “my whole 29 years in the Capitol."
But mostly Sanders referred to “reports from two leading Vermont cardiologists," letters that said, “Bernie Sanders is more than able to deal with the stress and the vigor of being president of the United States." He added: “Follow me around the campaign trail — three, four, five events a day — and see how you're doing compared to me."
That may satisfy Sanders supporters, but it's an inadequate response from a septuagenarian who suffered a heart attack four months ago while running for this nation's highest office. If Sanders has nothing to hide, he should stop behaving like a man with something to hide.
Born in 1941, Sanders is the oldest candidate vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination. If elected, he'll be 79 when he takes the oath of office in January 2021. That would make Sanders the oldest man ever elected president, a position currently held by President Trump, who turns 74 in June.
Concerns about age and health aren't new. When John McCain, then 71 and a cancer survivor, was running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, he finally capitulated to demands for his medical records. He allowed about 1,700 pages to be shown to a select group of reporters.
Sanders is unwilling to follow McCain's lead. In fact, he seems to be borrowing a soiled page or two from Trump, who repeatedly promised to release his tax returns and, four years later, hasn't made a single page available. Worse still, some on Sanders' team are comparing queries about the candidate's health to “birtherism," the scurrilous, racist claim that President Obama was not born in America.
If people were falsely claiming Sanders had a heart attack, that would amount to the kind of “smear campaign" Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders' national press secretary, is asserting. Evoking the ugliness of birtherism is a despicable attempt to silence those concerned about the long-term health of a man who recently had a very serious health scare.
The longer Sanders dodges this issue, the longer it will remain an issue. It's also worth mentioning that Sanders' team was misleading about what happened to the candidate last fall. Originally, they said he had a stent procedure to relieve chest discomfort; only days later was it revealed that he'd suffered a heart attack.
Sanders wants to be the next president of the United States. Those whose votes he seeks have a right to know if he is physically fit for the job. Letters from doctors, regardless of how glowing they may be, are not the same as medical records. (Trump also substituted a letter from his doctor — which, to no one's surprise, he himself dictated. If he has health issues, they remain a mystery.)
If you tried to take your dog to a kennel with only a letter from a veterinarian attesting to his health and vaccinations instead of an official shot record, both you and your fur baby would likely be turned away.
At the very least, voters shouldn't be chastised or shamed if they refuse to hold a presidential candidate to a lower standard than what most kennels require from a dog owner.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump likes to tell critics that he is not against immigration generally but simply opposed to the illegal variety. He has an excellent opportunity to prove his point and help a good economy become even better.
Across the country and across industries at businesses large and small, employers say they can't find enough workers to fill all of their open positions. The Trump economy features an outstanding job market for workers but also includes missed opportunities as employers can't staff up to meet demand. Now the Journal's Michelle Hackman reports some hopeful news :
The Trump administration plans to allow 45,000 additional seasonal guest workers to return to the U.S. this summer, the highest number since the president took office, according to three administration officials...
It wasn't clear whether the White House has fully signed off on the numbers, and an administration official cautioned they could change.
The President should not only sign off but raise the number even further to seize all the available opportunities in this robust economy. To his credit, the recent trend has been encouraging. Ms. Hackman reports:
The seasonal worker program, known as the H-2B visa program, enables U.S. employers to hire as many as 66,000 foreign workers a year, with the allotments split evenly between the winter and summer seasons. Congress permits the Department of Homeland Security each year to raise that cap by as many as 64,000 additional visas.
In Mr. Trump's first two years in office, DHS raised the cap by 15,000 visas to 81,000, and last year it raised the cap by 30,000 to 96,000.
The additional visas will primarily be available to workers who have previously qualified for H-2B visas because the administration has more confidence that they will leave the country once their job assignments end.
What's the argument against admitting people who have already proven they can be productive workers and good guests of the United States?
Also, America can always use productive citizens. There may be a separate opportunity to admit people who can become more than guests. Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey report in the Washington Post:
Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told a crowd at a private gathering in England on Wednesday night that the Trump administration "needs more immigrants" for the U.S. economy to continue growing, according to an audio recording of his remarks obtained by The Washington Post.
"We are desperate — desperate — for more people," Mulvaney said. "We are running out of people to fuel the economic growth that we've had in our nation over the last four years. We need more immigrants."
The Trump administration wants those immigrants to come in a "legal fashion," Mulvaney said, according to the recording.
The administration recently won a Supreme Court case allowing the government to tighten rules to ensure that immigrants do not require public assistance. The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says :
Self-sufficiency has long been a basic principle of U.S. immigration law. Since the 1800s, Congress has put into statute that individuals are inadmissible to the United States if they are unable to care for themselves without becoming public charges. Since 1996, federal laws have stated that aliens generally must be self-sufficient.
Fair enough. But for those who are ready and eager to work, why not let them make America even greater?

Texto completo: That Ferrari Chassis No. 0764 is art in motion is patently clear. That the exquisitely restored 1958 Ferrari 335 S Spyder — the fourth and last ever made — is worth millions is indisputable. But it’s the stories that swirl around the vintage racecar that make its journey so rich.
And that well-documented past was just one of the things the Ferrari had going for it when it won the 2019 Peninsula Classics Best of the Best Award in Paris earlier this month, beating out seven other world-class collector cars, including a 1932 Stutz DV32, a couple of 1931 Bentleys and a 1938 Mercedes-Benz 540K. The right-hand-drive Ferrari is owned by Austrian collector Andreas Mohringer.
Created five years ago, the show is the equivalent of the Super Bowl in the world of elite classic autos, and is limited to the year’s “best of show” winners of renowned concours like Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este on the shores of Lake Como, Pebble Beach, Amelia Island and the Cavallino Classic.
“As the automobile industry continues to evolve, not least technologically, with each passing year, celebrating the beauty, innovation, and craftsmanship that defined a century of automobile manufacturing takes on an ever-greater significance” said William “Chip” Connor, one of the founders of The Peninsula Classics Best of the Best award program. He’s also a regular exhibitor and into vintage racing.
Anointing a car with the Peninsula Hotels’ honor can be a daunting assignment — just ask the Westminster Kennel Club judges who raised the ire of thousands of TV and web viewers last week when they awarded Best in Show to a poofed-up black poodle, snubbing Daniel, a cheerful golden retriever who hugged his handler after winning the sporting class ribbon. (For more, see #danielwasrobbed)
Those tasked with selecting the classic auto world’s top dog for 2019 included luminaries like Henry Ford III, Nick Mason of Pink Floyd, and Jay Leno.
“It is difficult as a judge to choose a winner for The Peninsula Classics Best of the Best Award because each vehicle has already been selected as one of the best and most prestigious in the world and they’re all immaculate,” said Leno. “For 2019, we selected the Ferrari due to its extremely detailed history, including its racing heritage. Of course, it’s also an incredibly beautiful vehicle.”
No surprise to Ferrari fans since the 335 S Spyder body, featuring the distinctive pontoons that adorned the 250 Testa Rossa, was the work of famed coachbuilder Scaglietti. Under that long hood, the peerless pedigree continues with a four-liter dual overhead cam V12 we’re told was designed by Ferrari’s engineering wizard Vittorio Jano. The 335 S Spyder derives its name from the displacement of each of those dozen cylinders: 335 cc. Spinning at 7,400 rpm, the V12 is said to produce 390 horsepower.
Rule changes in Europe limiting engines to three liters rendered the 335 S Spyder obsolete. The solution was to export the car to America, where four-liter engines were still allowed. In the last month of 1958, Chassis No. 0764 was delivered to North American Racing Team (NART) owned by Luigi Chinetti, Enzo Ferrari’s friend. Chinetti, a former racer, helped put Ferrari on the map in the U.S. after World War II.
The New York-based importer sold the blue and white car (NART’s colors) to Alan Connell, a racer from Fort Worth, in September 1959. The 0764 served as eye candy at the 1960 New York Auto Show. Connell campaigned the Ferrari in various Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) races, including the 1959 SCCA nationals at Daytona International Speedway, which he won.
Disaster struck in May, 1960. At Virginia International Raceway the Ferrari’s engine blew. The car went back to New York to Luigi Chinetti Motors and was subsequently exported to Italy for repair. But the cost was so high — “on the order of $70,000” was how a New York Times article put it — Connell walked away and the car eventually wound up in a U.S. Customs warehouse.
In April, 1963, Gordon Tatum of Maryland bought the Ferrari after paying about $1,000 in storage charges and fees. Tatum kept the damaged engine but sold the chassis to one of his employees. From there, the trail of buyers and sellers — and the eventual reuniting of the original V12 and chassis — becomes a bit convoluted, involving nearly a dozen collectors in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Over the years, the car was sometimes repainted red.
Mohringer acquired the 335 S Spyder in 2013 for a reported $21 million. Restoration by Paul Russell and Co. of Massachusetts was completed in 2017.
Lots of press releases cross our desk but every so often one jumps out. In an era where the buzz is all about batteries, SUVs, self-driving vehicles and design languages that more often than not tout gaping grilles as “signatures” elements, the way-back look at No. 0764 was refreshing.
And so too is a classic Ferrari that isn’t red.

Pulling yourself up by bootstraps

Texto completo: Back in the 1800s, the expression "pull oneself up by the bootstraps" meant the opposite of what it does now. Then it was used mockingly to describe an impossible act.
An 1834 publication ridiculed a claim to have built a perpetual-motion machine by saying that the inventor might next heave himself over a river "by the straps of his boots." An 1840 citation scoffs that something is "as gross an absurdity as he who attempts to raise himself over a fence by the straps of his boots."
Yet this phrase has become part of America's mythology and the centerpiece of our approach to help those left behind: We harangue them to lift themselves up by the bootstraps. When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this month dismissed bootstrapping at a congressional hearing as "physically impossible," outrage reverberated across the conservative media world.
Sean Hannity's blog said that her assertion "left millions of television viewers scratching their heads." Another Fox News commentator said that Ocasio-Cortez was "completely clueless."
So let's think this through.
It's true that upward mobility has always resonated deeply in the United States. My father, a refugee from Romania and Ukraine, came to the United States because to him it symbolized opportunity (and, sure enough, it provided him rich opportunities).
Some people do manage heroic journeys to the top. Ben Carson grew up as an impoverished black child of a single mother in Detroit and became a pediatric neurosurgeon and secretary of housing and urban development. Bravo to him.
The problem is that this bootstraps narrative drives out good policy in three ways.
First, it suggests that historically Americans rose purely through rugged individualism - think of the pioneers!
Ah, but why did the pioneers go west? Because of government benefit programs that granted them homesteads! Ten percent of America's land was given out as homesteads, and perhaps one-quarter of Americans (almost all of them white) owe part of their family wealth to the homestead acts.
Then there was the American investment in free high schools and in state colleges and universities, plus gigantic programs like rural electrification and the GI Bill of Rights. In short, even when we were a much poorer nation, we were able to afford huge national investments to help disadvantaged (white) Americans, because they were a priority.
Second, the bootstraps narrative often suggests that benefits programs are counterproductive because they foster "dependency." That may have been a plausible argument a generation ago, but the evidence now indicates that it is incorrect.
Europe and Canada have much more robust social welfare systems than the United States, but Americans in the prime working years (ages 25 to 54) are more likely to drop out of the labor force than Europeans and Canadians in those years. Americans drop out of the labor force primarily because we do worse than other countries of investing in workers' education, health care, addiction treatment and job training.
Third, the bootstraps narrative implies that everyone can pull a Ben Carson (Carson himself falls for this fallacy). This is like arguing that because some people can run a four-minute mile, everyone can.
Yes, some Americans soar from humble beginnings; more often, the top is occupied by those who, say, were earning $200,000 a year at age 3, in today's money, as President Donald Trump was. Some research finds that upward mobility has tumbled in the United States over the last half-century and is now lower than in Europe.
It's particularly hard for people to scramble up when they come from violent homes, poor schools or foster care, or face impediments of race or class. These can be challenges, but they can be addressed to some extent - but not by sermons about bootstraps.
I received a note the other day from a carpenter in Washington State, Mike Stimac, about these issues. He grew up in a small town and describes himself as "more conservative than liberal," but he had read a new book that my wife and I wrote about Americans left behind, and he responded: "I had two parents who gave me a home, no alcohol or physical abuse. I always felt like we were just making it. My parents were blue collar (machinist, sawmill operator, seamstress, cafeteria cook). I never felt like I was privileged, but I see now that I was. 
"Being a carpenter and general contractor, here again I felt I pulled myself up by my bootstraps.' My wife and I made a living with hard work and family help and now have a fairly strong financial standing. But now I realize it is more than hard work and family help. I was privileged to have two parents who valued education (though they never went to college), I am white, and there was no abuse."
Stimac says he now favors substantial federal programs to provide opportunity and address addiction, mental illness and education, adding, "This is a real change of heart for me."
That change of heart is what we need for our country as a whole. American children need fewer wagging fingers or homilies about bootstraps, and more helping hands.

Wells Fargo Reaches Settlement With Government Over Fake-Account Scandal; Bank to pay $3 billion to settle investigations by the Justice Department and SEC

Texto completo: Wells Fargo & Co. will pay $3 billion to settle investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over its long-running fake-account problems, the latest chapter in an extraordinary scandal for one of the country's largest banks.
The deal resolves civil and criminal investigations. It includes a so-called deferred prosecution agreement, in which the Justice Department reserves the right to pursue criminal charges. But the bank has to satisfy the government's requirements, including its continued cooperation with further investigations, over the next three years.
The scandal has severely damaged the bank's reputation as well as its regulatory relationships. Regulators fined the bank in 2016 for creating fake and unauthorized checking and savings accounts, a revelation that outraged lawmakers and customers.
Friday's settlement shuts the door on a major portion of the bank's legal problems related to the fake accounts, a scandal that has claimed two CEOs. It is a victory for Charles Scharf, an outsider who took over as chief executive in October and was tasked with fixing the crisis.
The bank, though, still faces major regulatory problems. Most notably, it is under sanction by the Federal Reserve, which has taken the unusual step of capping the bank's growth. Settling with the Justice Department and SEC could allow the bank to focus on persuading the Fed to lift the cap.
Regulators and prosecutors could also still take action against individual former executives, according to people familiar with the situation. Last month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency charged eight former Wells Fargo executives over the fake-account scandal, including a former CEO.
As part of the settlement, Wells Fargo admitted that it "unlawfully misused customers' sensitive personal information" and harmed some customers' credit ratings, collecting millions of dollars of fees and interest in the process.
Wells Fargo for years enjoyed a reputation as a folksy industry darling that catered to Main Street customers. But that reputation was left in tatters after the sales scandal became public.
Prosecutors said the practices date to 1998, when Wells Fargo began to rely more heavily on sales growth. It pressured employees to sell additional products to current customers, a practice known as cross-selling.
The heightened pressure pushed many employees to undertake illegal practices, such as opening checking and savings accounts without customer knowledge and making up identification numbers to activate unauthorized debit cards. Sometimes employees forged customer signatures to open accounts or altered customers' contact information to prevent them from learning about unauthorized accounts, the government said.
Regulators and prosecutors said top managers knew of these issues in 2002. In 2004, an internal investigator called it a "growing plague."
After the scandal erupted in 2016, the bank's top executives faced heavy criticism for blaming lower-level employees. An investigation by the board of directors later found that the bank's decentralized structure allowed top executives to avoid addressing these issues as they got bigger.
The bank has struggled to recover since then. What was once a fast-growing lender whose profits towered above those of rivals has become a firm with declining revenue that is leaning heavily on cost cuts.

Texto completo: This content is provided exclusively to the Citizen Times by staffers at Malaprop's Bookstore/Cafe, 55 Haywood St., Asheville. To learn more, call 828-254-6734 or visit malaprops.com. The events described are free.
'The Splendid and the Vile' Winston Churchill faced his first test as prime minister of the United Kingdom when he, his family, and his circle of advisors endured Germany's aerial assault on England from 1940-41. This included 57 consecutive nights of bombing London, followed by six months of intensifying nighttime raids on industrial centers, towns, and cities across the U.K. Erik Larson sets out to understand how Churchill and those close to him survived the crucible of hellfire and destruction in "The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz."
The cigar-chomping Churchill that many lovers of history have come to know often appears in the context of the Blitz. But he also had a domestic life: at Chequers, his country house, and at his wartime home, Ditchley. The residents included his wife, daughter and son, his son's unhappy wife and her lover, and his "Secret Circle," a group of political advisers. What Larson reveals is a grittier side of family life, complete with crude dinnertime behavior and family fights. Meanwhile, MI5 fretted over whether or not Churchill's supplies of Cuban cigars were tainted with poison.
By January 1941, Churchill had developed bronchitis, and Clementine, his wife, a cold. Nothing, however, could deter the prime minister from traveling by train into blizzard conditions to observe the test firing of an experimental anti-aircraft weapon. Churchill's relentless drive allowed him to lead a nation and survive the Luftwaffe's onslaught long enough to try to persuade the United States to join the war effort.
For months, Churchill would watch bombing raids from the roof of Ditchley with his advisors, all of them wearing steel helmets. Far away, bombs erupted and airplane engines roared overhead. Every moment was mixed with courage and despair.
Erik Larson will discuss his book at 6:30 p.m. Feb. 28, in the Blue Ridge Room of UNC Asheville's Highsmith Student Union. He will be in conversation with Denise Kiernan, New York Times-bestselling author of "The Last Castle" and "The Girls of Atomic City." This is a ticketed event. Each ticket is $35 and includes admission to the event and a copy of the book. Visit malaprops.com to purchase your ticket through Brown Paper Tickets.

'Home Making' Lee Matalone, who has been featured in The Offing and Lit Hub, among other literary publications, is receiving rich and deserving praise for her debut novel, "Home Making." Publishers Weekly calls the novel "heady, lyrical," and Scott McClanahan, author of "The Sarah Book," writes: "Structurally bold and metaphorically rich, Matalone constructs a whole new world from the empty spaces inside us all."
That said, some readers may find the novel slightly disorienting at first. I'll admit that, at times, I had trouble triangulating my location in the narrative, but once I dispensed with my expectations of a linear story and relaxed my gaze a bit, I began to discern the novel's larger shape, seeing the chapters, as the author intended, as rooms in a sprawling house connected by relationships, and held together by the novel's overarching themes.
While Matalone's decision to construct chapters that change perspective and jump around in space and time does occasionally dislocate the reader's attention, it also sharpens it, making for a more interesting reading experience. Perhaps a slightly unsettled reader can more easily empathize with Cybil, Chloe and Beau as they strive to feel at home in the world. Luckily, we, the readers, have Matalone's sure prose to guide us through a novel that reminds us that the most difficult home to find is often the one within ourselves.
Malaprop's is happy to host Lee Matalone at 6 p.m. Feb. 26. She will be joined in conversation by Erica Witsell, author of the novel "Give."

National opioids settlement won't rival tobacco payday

Texto completo: As talks escalate to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits nationwide, a harsh reality is emerging: The money the pharmaceutical industry will pay to compensate ravaged communities will likely be far less than once envisioned.
Lawyers on all sides have been stepping up efforts to reach a national agreement before the start of a New York trial next month. But even plaintiff lawyers now believe the payout from dozens of opioid makers, distributors and retailers is likely to be less than half of what the four Big Tobacco companies agreed to pay more than 20 years ago in a landmark settlement with states over costs associated with millions of smoking-related deaths.
Whatever the final amount, it will certainly fall well short of what public health experts say is needed to heal the long-term effects of the opioid crisis.
The tobacco settlement of 1998 totaled more than $206 billion over 25 years. When pressed to name the dollar figure he was swinging for, Joe Rice, chief negotiator for thousands of cities and counties suing the pharmaceutical industry who was also instrumental in wresting the tobacco settlement, conceded in an interview: "People would say I was crazy if I thought we could get over $100 billion."
In October, the federal Council of Economic Advisers said that during the four-year period from 2015 through 2018, the economic toll from opioids was more than $2.5 trillion, including the cost of health care and law enforcement, and estimates of lost productivity.
The idea that some of the biggest U.S. corporations would not be made to cover a substantial portion of the opioid bill defies common sense to some people. But analysts and lawyers said the calculus to reach these settlements is even trickier than it was with the tobacco settlement.
For starters, four cigarette companies produced a single product - one whose dangers were undisputed. But prescription opioids are beneficial for some patients.
In addition, the dozens of companies targeted in the opioid lawsuits "do some very good things," said Rice, including making or selling an array of medicines, vitamins and medical devices as well as drugstore products like shampoo and baby lotion.
They include health and consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson; some of the world's largest makers of generic medicines; huge drug distributors McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health; and the national pharmacy chains, including Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. Opioids usually represent only a sliver of their business. Even plaintiffs' lawyers say it may not be in the public interest to squeeze the companies too tightly.
Lawyers and economists also say that pharma will most likely pay less than Big Tobacco because, by one crude measure, its damage is smaller: Prescription painkillers have claimed far fewer lives than cigarettes.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 218,000 people died of overdoses related to prescription opioids from 1999 through 2017. But each year, more than 480,000 people die of causes directly related to smoking or secondhand smoke.
So far, only two offers for a nationwide settlement have been disclosed. One offer, from Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, is valued by the company at about $10 billion, including at least $3 billion in cash from the members of the Sackler family, the owners. It has been tentatively accepted by about two dozen states and thousands of local governments but is far from final.
Another proposal, ostensibly worth $48 billion, is from the three drug distributors and two manufacturers (Teva and Johnson & Johnson), much of it to be paid over 18 years. But nearly half that figure is an in-kind assessment of the value of addiction treatment drugs and distribution services that the companies pledge to provide.

Texto completo: Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Donald Trump reelected, five people familiar with the matter said, in a disclosure that angered Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.
The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant.
During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Trump's allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that Trump has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans.
That intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced Wednesday that he was replacing Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter.
Though some current and former officials speculated that the briefing may have played a role in the removal of Maguire, who had told people in recent days that he believed he would remain in the job, two administration officials said the timing was coincidental. Grenell had been in discussions with the administration about taking on new roles, they said, and Trump had never felt a personal kinship with Maguire.
Spokeswomen for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and its election security office declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A House Intelligence Committee official called the Feb. 13 briefing an important update about "the integrity of our upcoming elections" and said members of both parties attended, including Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee.
The Washington Post first reported the Oval Office confrontation between Trump and Maguire.
In another wrinkle to Grenell's appointment, he may hold the job of overseeing the nation's 17 spy agencies for about three weeks -- unless the White House quickly finds a permanent nominee to offer for confirmation.
According to people familiar with the administration's deliberations, Grenell agreed to hold the post for only a limited period of time.
Federal law gives Trump a great deal of flexibility to appoint whomever he chooses to the position on a temporary basis while his official nominee for the job awaits confirmation from the Senate. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Grenell can serve in his post only until March 11 unless the president formally nominates someone else for the job.
That move would allow Grenell to serve for months longer as the nomination works its way through the Senate. Two administration officials said that officials were aware that they must nominate someone else soon, and that the process to find a formal nominee was underway.
"The President will announce the Nominee (not me) sometime soon," Grenell wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning.
Even before his new appointment Wednesday, Grenell had been working with the White House on issues related to intelligence, including pressuring allies not to use the Chinese telecom company Huawei to build the next-generation mobile network known as 5G because of security concerns. He is not giving up his ambassadorship to Germany or a broader diplomatic portfolio that involves developing a rail path between Kosovo and Serbia.

Buttigieg faces several obstacles

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg pinned his presidential hopes on success in Iowa and New Hampshire, thinking victories there would boost his chances in the states beyond.
He leaves with a slim lead in delegates, pending a potential recanvass in Iowa, but lags Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others in the polls nationally and in the next states to vote. So far, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has yet to capitalize on that earlier momentum.
His next chance is Saturday at the Nevada caucus, followed by the Feb. 29 South Carolina primary. After that, 14 states vote March 3 on Super Tuesday, when billionaire Michael Bloomberg joins the fray, which will give the clearest picture yet of who is viable and who is not.
Since New Hampshire, Buttigieg has been on the campaign trail trying to convince people in the upcoming states he should earn their votes. Here's where things stand:
Buttigieg spent big in Iowa and New Hampshire The young Democrat has been a darling of the donor class, routinely outraising higher profile candidates. The New York Times reports he spent much of that money in the first two nominating contests and has been on a mad dash for cash since.
Buttigieg attended 10 fundraisers in six states the first two weeks of February, according to the New York Times. His campaign also has stepped up the pace in which it's soliciting small-dollar donations in emails to supporters and asking for as little as $3 per person.
He has beefed up his Nevada staff to 100 and his South Carolina staff to 55, and he is planning to blitz both states with personal appearances.
Interestingly, he will be at a town hall in Colorado the night of the Nevada caucus. Conversely, he stayed in town for celebratory rallies the night of his apparent victory in Iowa and runner-up finish in New Hampshire. The change in approach is either a tell of his expected finish in Nevada or the reality of the short time he has to make an impact in the next 15 states.
Buttigieg will make five trips to Super Tuesday states by March 3, his campaign said. He has 25,000 volunteers working those 14 contests. He is personally visiting California, Colorado, Utah, North Carolina and Virginia, which may provide clues of where he sees opportunities. He is running digital advertisements in Minnesota, Maine, North Carolina and Virginia.
Buttigieg is generally trailing Sanders, Bloomberg and former Vice President Joe Biden in national polls, so he has quite a bit of ground to make up in a short period of time.
He is at a further disadvantage on Super Tuesday. Sen. Amy Klobuchar's home state of Minnesota votes that day, as does Sanders' home state of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren's home state of Massachusetts.
Buttigieg can't count on home turf for some time. Indiana votes May 5. Fellow Midwestern state Michigan votes March 10 while Illinois and Ohio vote March 17. Eventually, the money will dry up for candidates who can't keep winning states.
Sanders is the one to beat Sanders has been leading in the latest polls in Nevada, and Politico has reported he has one of the largest staffs in the state, 250 compared with Buttigieg's 100.
Sanders' strength appears to be his steady base of support.
"He's going to win with 28 percent of the vote," Andres Ramirez, former vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee's Hispanic Caucus, told Politico. "We're not talking about him getting 50 percent of the vote. But the rest of the field is so fragmented, and he has his base locked, that he can continue winning just by holding onto his base."
That's likely one of the main reasons Buttigieg and Klobuchar, who are targeting moderate voters, attacked each other so vehemently at Wednesday's debate.
Buttigieg hopes to win over union workers With 60,000 members, the culinary union is one of the political powerhouses in Nevada, but it's not endorsing a presidential candidate in the caucus. The union, interestingly, has informed members they would lose their private health insurance if Sanders or Warren enact "Medicare for All."
Buttigieg has been focusing on the union while campaigning, including in Wednesday's debate.
"You are the one who is at war with the culinary union right here in Las Vegas," Buttigieg told Sanders.
It's difficult to say whether Buttigieg has an opportunity. Union workers, as Sanders noted in his response, have supported his more progressive campaign.
"I have more union support than you have ever dreamed of," he told Buttigieg. "We have the support of unions all across this country."
Buttigieg joined picketing union members Wednesday outside a Las Vegas resort, along with Biden, Klobuchar and Warren, according to the Reno Gazette Journal.
Sanders and billionaire Michael Bloomberg did not.
Buttigieg needs to win votes from minority constituencies Buttigieg fared well in mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, but he has long been struggling to win over black and Latino voters.
He is not alone. Aside from Biden and Sanders, few Democrats have been polling well with racial minorities.
For Sanders, it's a turnaround from his 2016 campaign, when he faced much of the same criticism now being leveled at Buttigieg for lack of support from voters of color. But now that the senator from Vermont is more of a known quantity, he appears to be resonating.
Buttigieg has been trying to reach out. He made a 10-minute pitch Feb. 16 to the Nevada's Black Legislative Caucus in Las Vegas that wasn't enthusiastically received, according to the The Nevada Independent.
The news outlet reported he struggled to gain the attention of the couple of hundred people in the room, many of whom were loading up their plates with food during a lunch break. Buttigieg has faced similarly unenthusiastic, if more engaged, crowds at NAACP and National Urban League events in Indianapolis.
Still, in Nevada, he discussed his Douglass Plan to help African Americans.
"If every voice is heard, then this will become a country where we take the real steps that are necessary so that your race has no bearing on your health, or your wealth, your life expectancy or your experience with law enforcement in the United States of America," he told the crowd, according to The Nevada Independent. "That is up to us, and we have an opportunity to do it right now."
Latino votes will be more crucial in Nevada, where they make up nearly 30% of the population.
A Univision Poll conducted Feb. 9-14 among 1,306 registered Latino voters (306 from Nevada) shows Buttigieg with 8% of support in Nevada. Sanders led at 33%, followed by Biden at 22%.
Still, there's some suggestion Buttigieg's direct campaigning was helpful. In the same poll he fared lower nationally at 5%.
He's begun running digital advertisements in Nevada in which he tells voters in Spanish: "Se pronuncia Bút-ech-ech."
That translates to an introduction: "It's pronounced Boot-edge-edge."

Lawyers on all sides have been stepping up efforts to reach a national agreement before the start of a New York trial next month. But even plaintiff lawyers now believe the payout from dozens of opioid makers, distributors and retailers is likely to be less than half of what the four Big Tobacco companies agreed to pay more than 20 years ago in a landmark settlement with states over costs associated with millions of smoking-related deaths.
Whatever the final amount, it will certainly fall well short of what public health experts say is needed to heal the long-term effects of the opioid crisis.
The tobacco settlement of 1998 totaled more than $206 billion over 25 years. When pressed to name the dollar figure he was swinging for, Joe Rice, chief negotiator for thousands of cities and counties suing the pharmaceutical industry who was also instrumental in wresting the tobacco settlement, conceded in an interview: "People would say I was crazy if I thought we could get over $100 billion."
In October, the federal Council of Economic Advisers said that during the four-year period from 2015 through 2018, the economic toll from opioids was more than $2.5 trillion, including the cost of health care and law enforcement, and estimates of lost productivity.
The idea that some of the biggest U.S. corporations would not be made to cover a substantial portion of the opioid bill defies common sense to some people. But analysts and lawyers said the calculus to reach these settlements is even trickier than it was with the tobacco settlement.
For starters, four cigarette companies produced a single product - one whose dangers were undisputed. But prescription opioids are beneficial for some patients.
In addition, the dozens of companies targeted in the opioid lawsuits "do some very good things," said Rice, including making or selling an array of medicines, vitamins and medical devices as well as drugstore products like shampoo and baby lotion.
They include health and consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson; some of the world's largest makers of generic medicines; huge drug distributors McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health; and the national pharmacy chains, including Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. Opioids usually represent only a sliver of their business. Even plaintiffs' lawyers say it may not be in the public interest to squeeze the companies too tightly.
Lawyers and economists also say that pharma will most likely pay less than Big Tobacco because, by one crude measure, its damage is smaller: Prescription painkillers have claimed far fewer lives than cigarettes.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 218,000 people died of overdoses related to prescription opioids from 1999 through 2017. But each year, more than 480,000 people die of causes directly related to smoking or secondhand smoke.
So far, only two offers for a nationwide settlement have been disclosed. One offer, from Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, is valued by the company at about $10 billion, including at least $3 billion in cash from the members of the Sackler family, the owners. It has been tentatively accepted by about two dozen states and thousands of local governments but is far from final.
Another proposal, ostensibly worth $48 billion, is from the three drug distributors and two manufacturers (Teva and Johnson & Johnson), much of it to be paid over 18 years. But nearly half that figure is an in-kind assessment of the value of addiction treatment drugs and distribution services that the companies pledge to provide.

Texto completo: There has been a mass freak-out among the Democratic establishment as Bernie Sanders continues to surge in the polls. In two surveys released Tuesday, the Vermont Senator has opened up a double-digit lead over his closest competitors in the Democratic primary.
The desperation has caused many Democrats to set their sights on former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg as the man who will save us all from Donald Trump. But first he'll have to save us from Bernie Sanders. The billionaire businessman has paid a pretty penny for every point he has risen in the national polls to overtake the prior moderate savior, Joe Biden.
For most of the primary season, politicos, commentators and journalists have dismissed the Sanders candidacy at best or attacked and misrepresented it at worst with the New York Times editorial board myopically comparing Sanders to Trump and calling his policy prescriptions "overly rigid, untested and divisive." How often do we hear it claimed with soothsayer certainty, "A Democratic Socialist will never be elected president in the United States?"
You know who else will "never" be elected president of the United States? A former reality TV star with zero governing or policy experience who attacks war heroes, the parents of war heroes, brags on tape about grabbing women by the p----, and ... well, you get my point.
This is not to say that because Donald Trump became president – after improbably winning a Republican primary praising single payer health care, attacking the Bush family, the Iraq War and challenging other previously sacred cows on the right – that anyone can become president. It's to point out how the ground has shifted in terms of what is possible in politics. The old rules simply do not apply, so we should stop using them.
It's true that at one point calling yourself a "Democratic socialist" would be a bridge too far for many voters, including Democrats. But that was before people began to realize how unmoored the American capitalist system is from any sense of ethics or morality. The level of economic inequality and suffering from lack of affordable health care, crushing debt, and a discriminatory and racist for-profit incarceration system in one of the world's wealthiest countries is astonishing. People are exhausted from working non-stop trying to just survive financially in a system that dangles the carrot of financial stability or wealth always slightly out of reach except for a favored few. Nothing about this is normal and that is fundamentally Bernie Sanders' so-called "radical" argument.
As Bernie's new foil, Bloomberg is waving the "moderate lane" banner of electability and claiming that Bernie's kooky notions (which are just considered normal behavior in many industrialized countries) go too far for American voters. These are the same voters who would cut off your hand if you reached for their socialist Medicare or Social Security. Still, the premise of Bloomberg as electable slipped seamlessly into the public debate. Of course, Bernie fares just as well, and sometimes better, than Bloomberg in hypothetical matchups against Trump but the electable moniker has mysteriously eluded him.
What ultimately will make the Democratic standard bearer electable is his or her ability to excite and turn out voters. This is why the most pertinent issue for Bernie's electability argument has been his weak history attracting African American support. While he made significant inroads since 2016, much of that critical voting bloc has been locked up with Joe Biden. But that is shifting. Tuesday's NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist found that Bernie has narrowed that gap to just three points, and he tops Bloomberg by 12 points.
Either way, it's hard to believe that the mayor who expanded "stop and frisk" in New York City and defended it all the way up to a month before he announced his candidacy is going to excite black voters, particularly young black voters who have made their preference for Bernie manifest. For that matter, why would any Democratic voter, regardless of their race, be excited about a candidate who lacked the imagination to grasp that being treated like a criminal just for existing would be a traumatizing experience for black and brown people?
Moreover, Bloomberg's performance in his first Democratic primary debate last night was imperious and underwhelming. He absurdly claimed that the NDA's women at his company signed were "consensual" and refused to agree to let them speak openly about their experiences working for his company. He stumbled through an explanation of stop-and-frisk claiming, "it got out of control," when he was the one who had total control over it. Responding to Bernie's contention that billionaires should not exist, Bloomberg claimed he is giving all his money away. But trying to buy your way into the presidency is not charity. He came out of the gate attacking Sanders, claiming he had no chance to beat Trump, because he'll scare moderate voters.
But a Buzzfeed reporter surveyed moderate Democratic voters at a Biden Iowa event last month and one after another said despite their concerns about Sanders, they'd pull the lever for him if he won the nomination. There's no doubt that if Bernie is the nominee Republicans will continue to conflate Democratic socialism with communism and pretend that Venezuela is Sanders' ideal society even though Bernie has said he is a Democratic Socialist in the vein of the Scandinavian countries, home to the world's happiest people. Republicans will lie about what Bernie believes the same way they will lie about whoever becomes the Democratic nominee.
Democrats should have learned by now to not let Republicans pick their candidates for them. Remember when conventional wisdom in 2016 said Nancy Pelosi should be replaced because Republicans used her as a proxy to attack all Democrats as too liberal and out of touch? "After Democrats' Losses Nancy Pelosi Becomes a Symbol of What Went Wrong," a New York Times headline blared following the 2016 election. Pelosi managed to cling to her power and Republicans made the San Francisco pol the star of many of their 2018 campaign ads against Democrats in swing districts. Yet, the Democrats took back the House with the largest midterms margin in history. Then Pelosi emerged as one of the only Democratic leaders able to effectively stand up against Trump.
Ultimately, there's no reason to believe that voters are being motivated in any meaningful way by ideology this cycle. People who are more afraid of a single payer health care system and free college than they are of Donald Trump and his creeping authoritarianism are probably not Democratic voters or even Democratic leaning independents.
Bloomberg derided Bernie's views as "communism" in last night's debate, echoing Republican talking points. On the campaign trail last year, Sanders explained his vision of how Democratic socialism would work: it's "an economy in which you have wealth being created by the private sector, but you have a fair distribution of that wealth, and you make sure the most vulnerable people in this country are doing well."
Whatever people's fears about Bernie's democratic socialism, the fact remains he's running for president, not king, of the United States. Some of his solutions are dead on and others less so. But he cannot enact any of them without the support of Congress. This means he will have to use his bully pulpit to bring the country around to his point of view if he wants to enact change. American voters are capable of grasping this this.
It's well past time to bury the "Bernie is unelectable" trope.

Texto completo: The Feb. 7 Courier Journal reports on an interview of Sen. Mitch McConnell by Fox's Sean Hannity. In discussing Speaker Nancy Pelosi's ripping up of Trump's State of the Union speech, McConnell asked, "How childish and petty is that? What kind of example does that set for the American people about how we ought to conduct ourselves? I mean have we forgotten how to be civil to each other?"
McConnell asked the right question, while referring to the wrong person. The idea that any of Trump's sycophants could feign outrage at Pelosi's gesture of disdain is sheer hypocrisy. The litany of Trump's offensive, outrageous bilge is much too long to recount here. His singular act of mocking the disabled New York Times reporter is sufficient to place him, and all of his apologists and enablers, outside the bounds of human decency. It revokes their privilege to critique others' words. In Frank McCourt's words, they are "beyond the beyonds."
Unfortunately, the fatuous McConnell is Kentucky's senior senator. The Democratic primary to choose who will face off against McConnell is, therefore, of great importance. Fortunately, Mike Broihier ( pronounced Broyer) is in that primary field. Broihier has a wealth of valuable experience: retired lieutenant colonel, USMC, educator, former small town journalist/editor, and a current farmer in Lincoln County. Mike's experience, temperament and empathy will make him a long-overdue replacement for our current U.S. senator.
John Gonder, Louisville 40204
Reject Kentucky Republican leaders Recently, in a vindictive move to punish witnesses who testified against him, President Trump fired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Ambassador Gordon Sondland.
Last week the Department of Justice undermined the judge's ruling in the Roger Stone case, resulting in the resignation of all four prosecutors. This is perhaps Trump's most egregious assault on the rule of law.
Will Republican senators like Kentucky's Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, as well as the state's Republican representatives, again look the other way, blindly following the lead of their president?
It would appear so. We've already witnessed Sens. Alexander, Collins, Murkowski, Ernst and others admit that President Trump's actions in the Ukraine scandal were wrong. They also incorrectly predicted the impeachment would change his behavior, making him more cautious.
Voting is a powerful democratic tool – and, in this case, perhaps the last way to hold this president and his congressional enablers accountable. I hope Kentucky voters will place principle above party. They should defeat McConnell, Trump's chief enabler and someone who consistently excuses the president every time he engages in reprehensible behavior. They also should condemn Sen. Paul and vote against the state's five Republican representatives in the House.

Texto completo: Zoe Kravitz is in the process of curating a pretty dope playlist.
After a few catchy early numbers and some recent jams like "Big Little Lies," the actor, singer, model and now producer is pumping up the volume on her career with new Hulu series "High Fidelity" and, of course, Matt Reeves' "The Batman," in which she co-stars as Catwoman.
Variety caught up with Kravitz, 31, to talk romantic comedies, playing opposite Robert Pattinson and those "Big Little Lies" behind-the-scenes issues.

Q: Your character in "High Fidelity" is someone who lives and breathes music. Is that something you relate to?
A: Her inability to fully see herself is something I've experienced, something I've gone through. Someone who's able to understand something like music so deeply and then struggle to understand how a relationship works is really interesting to me. I've had those moments in my life where I felt like I understand art and music really well, I can talk about that, I can do that - but love is more complicated.

Q: What romantic comedies, other than the original "High Fidelity," were you looking to for inspiration?
A: "Sex and the City" was a major influence for me. There was a certain element of comedy and true drama and authenticity, wit and fearlessness that always attracted me, and it's also just such a New York show; for someone who lives there, they did it correctly. I've always been drawn to the kinds of stories that revolve around people stuck in a place and the things they talk about, because it felt like what I do with my friends. You sit around, you smoke weed, you talk about movies, you argue about characters and actors and music. That's some of my favorite (stuff) to do. When it's written well, when it feels real, it's so fun to see.

Q: Talk to me about the regular fourth-wall breaks; what do they illuminate about your character?
A: When you do those, you have to break a habit, because your whole career you're told to not look at the camera, not acknowledge it, so I had to allow myself to have a new relationship with the camera, to think of it as my friend. It's good to imagine a person there, you're talking to your friend because it can feel stiff and performative otherwise, because that device lets the audience into the character, especially because Rob is so guarded, it's important that she's able to feel vulnerable in those moments. I would literally picture a friend of mine in front of the camera and say I'm talking to a person right now.

Q: Those coupled with the subject matter feel very reminiscent of "Fleabag."
A: I actually didn't watch "Fleabag" on purpose ... because when we were writing it and people learned I was talking to camera, the first thing they would say is "Fleabag!" I felt like if I saw the show I would either imitate, or be intimated by, or compare myself to Phoebe's performance. I did not watch the show until after, and then of course I loved it and thought it was ... perfect.

Q: Switching focus to "The Batman," DC films come with their own unique brand of pressure. Is that something you're nervous about?
A: Definitely, I was excited when I got the role, and usually when you get a job, the people who are excited about it are you, your parents, your agent, your friends and that's kind of it. But when the press release came, I got more text messages and calls than I've gotten on my birthday, on my wedding day. All of a sudden, the reality began to sink in about what this means not only to me but to everybody else culturally - and the fans of this universe are so dedicated and opinionated.

Q: You could certainly say that.
A: It was a little scary, but also whenever I get nervous about something, I feel it pushes me to a better place, so I welcome the nerves. If you start focusing too much on what people are going to think you're doing yourself a disservice. Of course, I want to honor the fans and hope they like what I do with the role, but in order to do what I think I need to do with Catwoman, I have to go internal and forget about the rest of the world.

Q: How do you feel about Robert Pattinson as Batman? What has it been like working with him so far?
A: I've never worked with him before, but we've been together for the last few weeks ... training together and rehearsing together, and he's just a delightful person and such a wonderful, thoughtful actor. I think he's perfect for the role, and it's going to be such an adventure. I'm excited to have him as my partner in crime and to be there to support each other, because it's intense. It's going to be a long shoot and there's a lot of pressure, and I know he has my back and I have his.

Q: Nicole Kidman said she would be open to doing another season of "Big Little Lies," but she pointed to your busy schedule to say that a potential Season 3 won't be here for some time.
A: Mine?! How about Meryl or Reese or Shailene? For wonderful reasons everyone's busy, but I think we would all make time to make another season happen. It really feels like priority No. 1 for a lot of us, because we love each other, and we love the story and we love culturally what it means to people. I feel like all of us would clear whatever we could to make that happen. But don't try and throw me under the bus, Nicole!

Q: Did you feel like Season 2 provided a satisfying ending to Bonnie's story?
A: I don't know if it felt like an ending, but it felt like there was a breakthrough, especially coming from Season 1 where she's seen as this picture-perfect, very Zen person. It was nice to break that all down this season. It's almost like we met Bonnie for the first time by the end of Season 2. It's always a delight to get the opportunity to go deeper into a character, because you don't always get a chance to do that.
Caption: Zoe Kravitz says "Sex and the City" was a big inspiration for her latest role in Hulu's "High Infidelity." "It's such a New York show," she said.

Nanjiani thinks immigrant stories can still be hopeful

Texto completo: A cowboy walks into a bar. Or more specifically, a Nigerian immigrant grad student in a cowboy hat walks into a bar in Oklahoma.
His name is Iwegbuna, and he's trying to find comfort in a new land - ultimately, via cowboy culture - in an episode from "Little America," the Apple TV Plus anthology series created by Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon (the husband-wife duo behind "The Big Sick"), and Lee Eisenberg. The sight of the Stetson-wearing Iwegbuna, played by Nigerian-born actor Conphidance, offers a snapshot of the show's quietly radical conceit - that some glimpses of Americana might be surprising but that doesn't make them any less American.
Across eight episodes, the series, based on true stories, traverses the country and the globe, each installment tracking a different immigrant's journey to or within the United States.
Nanjiani, who moved to the United States from Pakistan at 18 (and who does not appear in the show), discussed the aim of "Little America," the process of creating the right writers room and his own relationship to the American dream.

Q: This anthology approach to immigrant stories feels new. Were you trying to do something completely different?
A: It's very easy to pigeonhole these types of stories - the story of the immigrant is one of struggle and strife, that kind of stuff. Obviously those stories exist and they're valid, and some of them are in our show as well. But we really focused on the idea that every episode was going to be completely different, have a completely different tone.

Q: Did the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies inform how you told these stories?
A: We do not want this show to have a political agenda, but obviously some of that is going to be there because of what the show is. If there is a political agenda in the show, it's just that immigrant experiences are very varied, as are anybody else's experiences. Just saying that immigrants are human beings feels like such a basic thing, but I know if I say that on Twitter right now, I'll get a lot of people upset about it. Somehow a simple statement of fact has become a radical political stance.

Q: The stories are often more celebratory than traumatic. Were you consciously trying to subvert the usual immigrant narratives of "struggle and strife," as you put it earlier?
A: That's what we wanted. There's a story about a kid whose parents get deported. That's very close to exactly how all that happened, and obviously that's something which, by its nature, is a little more political. But then there's another story about just a guy trying to get a big rock off his property, which I think is something that anybody could relate to. To me, the idea of that big rock that you can't get rid of is such a great analogy for the American dream ... that anybody can be what they want to be, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, you can do it, anybody can live the American dream - is that true? I mean, it depends what your background is. For some people it's a lot harder.

Q: For many of these characters, the American dream is a tangible thing, not just an idea or a myth. Was it the same for you?
A: For me, the idea of America had come from movies and TV shows, and so I thought all of America was New York or LA. And then I moved here - I moved to Iowa. That's not an America you really see. So, really, the image of America in the rest of the world on one side is sort of this power that can cause harm. On the other side, it's this place where it's almost like utopian, where anybody can do whatever they want to do - for these characters, that is part of the America they think they're coming to. And they have that struggle in different ways.

Q: Considering its mix of experiences, do you think "Little America" has an optimistic view of this country? And do you share that view?
A: Despite all the issues, I personally do feel optimistic about this country. It is my home, and I chose it to be my home for a reason.

Texto completo: As talks escalate to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits nationwide, a harsh reality is emerging: The money the pharmaceutical industry will pay to compensate ravaged communities will likely be far less than once envisioned.
Lawyers on all sides have been stepping up efforts to reach a national agreement before the start of a New York trial next month. But even plaintiff lawyers now believe the payout from dozens of opioid makers, distributors and retailers is likely to be less than half of what the four Big Tobacco companies agreed to pay more than 20 years ago in a landmark settlement with states over costs associated with millions of smoking-related deaths.
Whatever the final amount, it will certainly fall well short of what public health experts say is needed to heal the long-term effects of the opioid crisis.
The tobacco settlement of 1998 totaled more than $206 billion over 25 years. When pressed to name the dollar figure he was swinging for, Joe Rice, chief negotiator for thousands of cities and counties suing the pharmaceutical industry who was also instrumental in wresting the tobacco settlement, conceded in an interview: "People would say I was crazy if I thought we could get over $100 billion."
In October, the federal Council of Economic Advisers said that during the four-year period from 2015 through 2018, the economic toll from opioids was more than $2.5 trillion, including the cost of health care and law enforcement, and estimates of lost productivity.
The idea that some of the biggest U.S. corporations would not be made to cover a substantial portion of the opioid bill defies common sense to some people. But analysts and lawyers said the calculus to reach these settlements is even trickier than it was with the tobacco settlement.
For starters, four cigarette companies produced a single product - one whose dangers were undisputed. But prescription opioids are beneficial for some patients.
In addition, the dozens of companies targeted in the opioid lawsuits "do some very good things," said Rice, including making or selling an array of medicines, vitamins and medical devices as well as drugstore products like shampoo and baby lotion.
They include health and consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson; some of the world's largest makers of generic medicines; huge drug distributors McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health; and the national pharmacy chains, including Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. Opioids usually represent only a sliver of their business. Even plaintiffs' lawyers say it may not be in the public interest to squeeze the companies too tightly.
Lawyers and economists also say that pharma will most likely pay less than Big Tobacco because, by one crude measure, its damage is smaller: Prescription painkillers have claimed far fewer lives than cigarettes.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 218,000 people died of overdoses related to prescription opioids from 1999 through 2017. But each year, more than 480,000 people die of causes directly related to smoking or secondhand smoke.
So far, only two offers for a nationwide settlement have been disclosed. One offer, from Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, is valued by the company at about $10 billion, including at least $3 billion in cash from the members of the Sackler family, the owners. It has been tentatively accepted by about two dozen states and thousands of local governments but is far from final.
Another proposal, ostensibly worth $48 billion, is from the three drug distributors and two manufacturers (Teva and Johnson & Johnson), much of it to be paid over 18 years. But nearly half that figure is an in-kind assessment of the value of addiction treatment drugs and distribution services that the companies pledge to provide.

Corrupt Stone's next in line for pardon Los Angeles Times Editorial

Texto completo: Not for the first time, President Donald Trump has perverted the presidential pardon power to benefit undeserving recipients with whom he shares a personal or political affinity.
On Tuesday, the White House announced that Trump had commuted the prison sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, an epically corrupt politician who once appeared on Trump's reality TV series "Celebrity Apprentice." He also granted a pardon to former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, who was appointed to that post by then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, currently Trump's personal lawyer.
Objectionable as these grants of clemency may be, they also raise concerns about what would be an even more outrageous abuse of the pardon power: clemency for convicted Trump associates, including Paul Manafort, Trump's 2016 campaign chairman, and Roger Stone, of Fort Lauderdale.
On Tuesday, Trump again expressed sympathy for Stone, who on Thursday was sentenced to serve three years and four months in prison for lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. (Trump asserted, however, that he hadn't given any thought to a pardon for Stone. Right.)
The Constitution gives the president essentially unbounded power "to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment." But a principled president would exercise that power in the interests of mercy, not because the recipients of clemency are prominent or political bedfellows or well-connected or cronies of the president himself.
Trump, however, seems to see the pardon power as a way to reward supporters and score political points. The beneficiaries of his clemency have included former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a hero of the anti-immigrant right who was absolved of a contempt-of-court conviction; conservative provocateur Dinesh D'Souza, who was pardoned after pleading guilty to violating campaign finance laws; and, more recently, several members of the U.S. military, including three service members accused or convicted of war crimes.
Blagojevich was convicted in 2011 of several counts of corruption, including trying to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama after he won the presidency. He has served eight years of a 14-year sentence.
In addition to the "Celebrity Apprentice" connection, Blagojevich was prosecuted by Patrick Fitzgerald, a friend of James Comey, who was fired as FBI director by Trump and who has become an obsession for the president. On Tuesday, Trump said that the case against Blagojevich was "a prosecution by the same people - Comey, Fitzpatrick - the same group." (Comey wasn't even in the Justice Department when Blagojevich was prosecuted.)
Trump made the point that Blagojevich was a Democrat, and the White House noted that some prominent Illinois Democrats have supported cutting short Blagojevich's sentence. But that doesn't mean Trump's action wasn't improper for other reasons. As all five Illinois Republican House members warned the president last year in a joint statement: "Commuting the sentence of Rod Blagojevich, who has a clear and documented record of egregious corruption, sets a dangerous precedent and goes against the trust voters place in elected officials."
Kerik was sentenced to four years in prison in 2010 after pleading guilty to tax fraud and making false statements. Among other actions, he admitted to speaking to city regulators on behalf of a contractor who had done renovations on his apartment for free. Kerik was released in 2013.
In granting clemency to Blagojevich and Kerik, Trump, who has spoken in lurid terms about street crime, seemed to be less bothered by crimes involving white-collar defendants and corrupt public officials. That same message is sent by his pardons of Edward DeBartolo Jr., a former owner of the San Francisco 49ers who pleaded guilty in 1998 to concealing an extortion attempt by former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, and junk bond king Michael Milken.
Some of the grants of clemency issued by Trump on Tuesday are defensible, including commutations for two women convicted of drug offenses. But often when Trump extends clemency to a recipient, deserving or less so, he does so after the intervention of a celebrity. That was the case with Alice Marie Johnson, whose sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction was commuted after intervention by reality television star Kim Kardashian West. That hardly seems like justice.
Overall, Trump's exercise of the pardon power has been at best whimsical and at worst self-serving and blatantly political.
The president would be a committing an even worse corruption of the pardon power if he uses it to annul the convictions of Manafort and Stone. Given Trump's contempt for law enforcement and the judicial system, that is a real concern.

Fracking splits Dem rivals Some want immediate ban, which critics argue could hurt energy grid, employment, Pa. chances

Texto completo: The swing state of Pennsylvania came up once during Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate: when the moderators asked about a ban on fracking, an issue that divides the primary field.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts support ending the practice of fracking, a process used to extract natural gas or oil from underground rock formations like the Marcellus Shale formation below much of Pennsylvania.
Others in the Democratic primary field have taken a less stringent approach, focusing on tightening oversight of the industry and shifting to cleaner fuels over time.
Critics of the push by Sanders and Warren to ban fracking - including some Pennsylvania Democrats - say doing so too swiftly could have harmful effects on the energy grid and employment.
One of the debate moderators, Chuck Todd, framed that critique to Sanders in terms of potential political ramifications in Pennsylvania, quoting a union official who told the New York Times that he'll tell his members to support "the other guy" if Democrats nominate a presidential candidate who supports a fracking ban.
"What do you tell these workers, it's supporting a big industry right now, sir?" Todd asked.
Sanders responded: "What I tell these workers is that the scientists are telling us that if we don't act incredibly boldly within the next six, seven years, there will be irreparable damage done not just in Nevada, not just to Vermont or Massachusetts, but to the entire world."
Sanders also argued that the Green New Deal proposal that he supports would create new jobs in the energy-efficiency and alternative energy industries.
"This is a moral issue, my friends," Sanders added. "We have to take the responsibility of making sure that the planet we leave our children and grandchildren is a planet that is healthy and habitable. That is more important than the profits of the fossil fuel industry."
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar reiterated her opposing view that natural gas should be viewed as a transitional fuel until cleaner technologies are readily available for wide use.
"I have made it very clear that we have to review all of the permits that are out there right now for natural gas and then make decisions on each one of them and then not grant new ones until we make sure that it's safe," Klobuchar said. "But it is a transitional fuel."
A November poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Cook Political Report found 57% of Pennsylvania swing voters - those who were undecided on the presidential race or who indicated they were not yet voting for the nominee from either party - said a fracking ban is not a good idea. The poll also found nearly 7 in 10 of those voters supported the idea of a "Green New Deal" for the environment.
Democratic officials in western Pennsylvania, where gas drilling is active, have pushed back on a fracking ban.
After one of his colleagues, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, introduced legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives to do so, western Pennsylvania Congressman Conor Lamb urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold a vote on a bill to boost spending on clean energy technologies.
"If [the fracking ban] were enacted - and survived likely court challenges - it would eliminate thousands of jobs in my state and likely millions across the country," Lamb wrote. "It would also remove from our energy grid the source of power that has been most responsible for reducing carbon emissions in our country."
After Wednesday's debate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat who lives outside Pittsburgh, posted on Twitter that both parties need to change their approach on environmental politics.
"The fracking debate exposes a dual truth in American politics: Republicans must get honest about climate. My party must get honest about energy and industry," Fetterman wrote. "The messy collision of these realities is most stark here in Pennsylvania."
Republicans already are using the Democrats' internal disagreement as a way to portray the party as harmful for the growing industry in the battleground state.
U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., introduced a resolution last year reaffirming that a president may not unilaterally ban fracking on state and private lands, saying as he rolled out the measure that top Democrats running for president were "competing with each other over who can be more hostile to this tremendous source of economic growth and national security."

Texto completo: In hypothetical matchups against President Donald Trump, the top Democrats running to succeed him have a narrow edge in Pennsylvania, according to a new poll from Quinnipiac University.
Trump is between 42% and 44% when matched against six of the Democratic presidential hopefuls, who tally between 47% and 50%. The poll was conducted before Wednesday night's Democratic candidate debate in Las Vegas.
* Former Vice President Joe Biden led Trump by the widest margin, 50% to 42%.
* Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar led Trump, 49% to 42%.
* Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg led Trump, 48% to 42%.
* Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led Trump, 48% to 44%.
* Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg led Trump, 47% to Trump's 43%.
* Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was at 47% to Trump's 44%, which was within the poll's 3.4 percentage point margin of error.
Pennsylvania was one of three swing states where Quinnipiac conducted its latest set of polls, and the state where the Democratic presidential hopefuls posted their strongest numbers. The poll data showed a close race among Michigan voters, and showed Trump leading in Wisconsin.
Among Pennsylvania voters, 29% said their top issue is the economy, followed by 26% who said health care, and 13% who said climate change. Those answers diverged along party lines: 49% of Republicans said the economy was their top issue, while 44% of Democrats said health care.
On the economy, 57% of Pennsylvanians said their personal financial situation is better off than it was in 2016, with 20% who said they are worse off and 21% who said their situation is unchanged.
The survey of 849 registered Pennsylvania voters was conducted from February 12 to 18.

A Gwathmey house with literary roots

Texto completo: The modernist architecture of Charles Gwathmey is usually associated with Amagansett beach houses. One of the only homes with a Gwathmey connection on the North Shore of Long Island, which has been owned by two renowned writers and received a design award, has come on the market for $1,085,888.
In 1970, Gwathmey and his then-partner, Richard Henderson, of the firm Gwathmey & Henderson, were commissioned by playwright and screenwriter Loring Mandel to design a home in Huntington Bay.
Mandel and his wife had purchased just under two acres of a valley that had been part of an arboretum for hybrid rhododendron and wanted a home that would fit well on the property.
"This house was designed to take the smallest part of the land, to catch the sun exactly right, to feed the eye with natural surfaces and unobstructed views of the valley," Mandel wrote in an article published in the Dec. 6, 1970, issue of The New York Times.
In 1972 the home, along with 19 other houses and eight apartments, received an Award of Excellence in Residential Design from the publication Architectural Record.
"Even now, Henderson's design is unusual in an area of large, early 20th-century residences and POMO 'Macmansions,'" the publication wrote, noting that the design combined "three styles of architecture that are related but separate strands of Modernism."
"The wish of the client that the house must respect and serve the site meant that the architect drew upon the long American Modernist tradition of tying the building into the site and creating a place for the contemplation of nature," the article reads. "In contrast to this, the form of the architecture and its plan combine the new styles of architecture of which Gwathmey Henderson were pioneers -- the formal geometries of the New York Five School and the pre-war European Modernism of vaguely nautical white walls, balconies, pilotis and thick, flat roofs. Unusually, the building also combines a concrete and wooden structure that adds to the sense of a hybrid Modernism expertly synthesized."
The article also notes the open kitchen, which is unique for its time.
For the architects, "the beauty was in the property," says Belinda Wiseman of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Laffey International Realty, who is co-listing the property with Leslie Delboy. "That valley was the jewel of everything."
The home was later owned by Alyson Richman, the bestselling author of five novels, including "The Lost Wife."
The three-bedroom, 2½-bathroom home features glass doors and patios that overlook the secluded, wooded property and walls and ceilings clad in cedar.
A buyer may want to update the kitchen and bathrooms, perhaps with white quartz or other natural materials  but otherwise the house has stood the test of time.
"It was very ahead of its time in terms of the ergonomics and geometric lines of the house," Wiseman says. "If you blended an apartment in Manhattan with a house in the Hamptons, this is what you'd get."

State AG Accuses City in Taxi Crisis

Texto completo: New York Attorney General Letitia James has demanded $810 million from New York City, accusing the city's taxi regulator of playing a role in fraudulently inflating the value of medallions.
In a formal legal claim sent to City Comptroller Scott Stringer on Thursday, Ms. James said the city made hundreds of millions of dollars marketing and auctioning thousands of medallions, while helping to keep values artificially high. A medallion is a metal shield that serves as the city's license to pick up street hails across the city.
When medallion values plunged to less than $200,000 from a high of more than $1 million several years ago, many medallion owners filed for bankruptcy. Many drivers still struggle. There are about 13,500 such medallions in New York City.
Freddi Goldstein, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said his administration didn't play a role in the medallion crisis. Since Mr. de Blasio took office in 2014 the city has tried to help drivers and curb the spread of ride-hailing competitors such as Uber Technologies Inc., she said.
"This crisis has been ours to solve -- working tirelessly to clean up the carelessness and greed of others," Ms. Goldstein said. "If the attorney general wants to launch a frivolous investigation into the very administration that has done nothing but work to improve the situation, this is what she'll find."
Ms. James gave notice that she would sue the city if it doesn't meet her demands within 30 days. She said the funds would pay for restitution and damages to medallion owners.
Mr. Stringer said his office would review the attorney general's claims.
Ms. James launched an investigation following a series of articles in the New York Times last year charting how lenders, brokers and others in the taxi industry profited from the artificial inflation of medallion values.
In the claim, the attorney general said that from at least 2004, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission set an artificial floor for prices and allowed brokers to inflate and collude on cost.
At the same time, she said, the regulator marketed medallions as a solid investment with returns better than the stock market.
Between 2004 and 2014, some medallion values more than tripled, Ms. James said. As early as 2011, she said, the regulator knew values were artificially high but didn't warn buyers.
The city made more money than it should have on medallion sales and transfers because of the artificially inflated prices, Ms. James said.
Earlier this week, an investment firm known for buying up distressed assets purchased thousands of medallions following the collapse of several credit unions that invested heavily in the licenses.

TOOMEY DEFENDS SENATE'S TRIAL OF TRUMP SAYS REMOVAL WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERREACH

Texto completo: In a keynote address to a Westmoreland County economic development group in Latrobe on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey said he worries the recent move to remove President Donald Trump from office will normalize the use of impeachment, which he deemed "the thermonuclear weapon of American politics."
Mr. Toomey, R-Pa., said it would be an "unhealthy development" if impeachment becomes an ordinary political tool, adding that he's concerned the House "[lowered] the bar" on what is considered an impeachable offense.
It was a "dramatic overreach" to believe that Mr. Trump's actions - pausing military aid to Ukraine in pursuit of an investigation into his domestic political rival - warranted his removal from office, Mr. Toomey said.
Mr. Toomey said the aid was eventually released without Ukraine doing what Mr. Trump "may well have wished they would do" - though according to The New York Times, Mr. Trump did so after he was briefed on a whistleblower's complaint about his withholding of aid.
The senator insisted that he and his colleagues did "the right thing" during the trial, which resulted in the president's acquittal. Mr. Toomey said they heard the arguments by House managers, allowed the president's attorneys to give a defense and then held a question-and-answer session, which is how the process is supposed to proceed.
Mr. Toomey also used his Thursday speech to talk about the ways Congress can continue to encourage economic growth, which he said has led to a "very strong" economy in which wage growth is accelerating, 401(k)s "are more valuable than they've ever been" and there are more job openings than Americans looking for work.
"When you put all those things together, it's what we used to call a Goldilocks economy," Mr. Toomey said. "It's really pretty good, and I think we ought to think about how we got here and make sure we don't do anything in Washington to mess this up."
Mr. Toomey credited the successes mostly to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the slashing of "excessive" regulations.
But to continue the growth, Mr. Toomey said Congress needs to make permanent the temporary provisions in the tax reform that are set to expire in the next half decade, including the lowering of tax rates across all brackets and the 20% deduction of net income for smaller businesses.
He pointed to legislation he introduced last week, the ALIGN Act, which would make permanent a provision in the tax reform law - now set to wind down at the end of 2022 - that allows businesses to "immediately write off purchases of new equipment," he wrote in a statement then.
According to his office, Mr. Toomey hasn't yet introduced legislation to make permanent the individual tax cuts, but he's been advocating for doing so since the bill was enacted.
"My Democratic colleagues who don't like what we did with the business side of the tax reform do not want to be responsible for the tax increase that would incur for individuals, so I think there's an opportunity to put it all together and extend what I think is very good, constructive policy," Mr. Toomey said.
To keep economic growth moving forward, Mr. Toomey said it's imperative to protect the natural gas industry in the face of a "movement" underway to ban fracking.
Mr. Toomey said some Democrats' calls to abolish fracking "[make] absolutely no sense whatsoever," insisting that it benefits consumers, among others, by allowing them to heat their homes at a lower cost.
Noting that Pennsylvania produces the second-highest amount of natural gas in the country, Mr. Toomey defended it by saying America releases less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere now than it did "years ago, and it's because natural gas has supplanted coal as a source of electric generation."
He said he's introduced legislation that would serve as a reminder to future presidents that "a president doesn't have the legal authority to ban fracking on state and private land, even though we have candidates who claim to have that authority."
"Does this become the default position of Democrats generally?" Mr. Toomey asked in response to questions from reporters after the speech. "That's what I'm worried about, because it would be terrible for Pennsylvania."

Security adviser out at White House

Texto completo: The White House's deputy national security adviser, Victoria Coates, will move to the Energy Department after battling rumors among some of President Trump's supporters that she is the author and Trump critic "Anonymous."
A senior administration official said the move has been in the works for several weeks and that the White House does not believe Coates is the author of the book "A Warning" or a 2018 op-ed in the New York Times that described Trump officials who sought to "thwart parts of his agenda."
The publisher of "A Warning" has publicly denied that Coates is the author of the book. The White House National Security Council said Thursday that Coates will become a senior adviser to Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette. She starts her new position on Monday.
"While I'm sad to lose an important member of our team, Victoria will be a big asset to Secretary Brouillette as he executes the president's energy security policy priorities," national security advisor Robert O'Brien said in a statement. "She has served the president loyally since the earliest days of the administration and has played a valued role in the president's Middle East policy."
Axios reported Coates's move earlier on Thursday.
Coates is the latest departure from the White House as Trump engages in retaliation against government officials he considers disloyal, following his acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial earlier this month. Last week, Trump recalled the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, and ordered the dismissal of two National Security Council aides, Alexander and Yevgeny Vindman.
Alexander Vindman testified in the impeachment inquiry that Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked for investigations of former president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, was "improper."
On Wednesday, Trump demanded and received the resignation of Pentagon Undersecretary for Policy John Rood. CNN reported earlier this month that Rood had warned Defense Secretary Mark Esper against cutting off US military aid to Ukraine after the White House blocked money Congress had appropriated for the country last summer, as Trump sought to pressure Ukraine's government to investigate political rivals.
Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he knows the identity of "Anonymous," but refused to publicly name the official.
"It's not so much a search. I know who it is," Trump told reporters when asked if there is an ongoing search for the author.
"People know it's a fraud," he added. "I know who it is, and I know who some of the leakers are."

US has plan to cut effects of farming on environment
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, whose department has been criticized for suppressing research on climate change, announced an initiative to reduce the environmental impact of American farming.
Perdue emphasized voluntary conservation incentives and efficiency improvements rather than regulation as he joins major farm groups in seeking to shape the public debate on agriculture and climate change. Twenty-one farm groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Pork Producers Council, announced a coalition Wednesday on environmental sustainability.
Climate change is gaining greater public attention after years of record-high global temperatures, rising sea levels, dramatic wildfires in California and Australia, and widespread spring floods last year that delayed planting in the Midwest. The issue of agriculture's role in climate change has surfaced in Democratic presidential primaries, with leading candidates calling for reductions in farming's carbon emissions through incentive payments.
Perdue has set a goal of increasing farm production by 40 percent while cutting the “environmental footprint" in half by 2050.
“We think that's attainable," he said in a speech Thursday. “It's a stretch goal. But we think we can get there."
The initiative includes goals such as a 50 percent reduction in food waste by 2030, a 30 percent cut in fertilizer runoff by 2050, and an overall “net reduction" in carbon emissions by 2050 “without regulatory overreach." A Department of Agriculture official declined to specify how the department would measure the environmental footprint.
The secretary also set a goal for biofuels such as ethanol to reach “market-driven blend rates" of 15 percent of US transportation fuels by 2030 and 30 percent of transportation fuels by 2050. Both would require policy action by the Environmental Protection Agency.
“We know we have a challenge facing us: to meet future food, fiber, fuel, and feed demands with finite resources," Perdue said at his department's annual Agricultural Outlook Forum.
Excerpts of the speech didn't make mention of climate change. The USDA inspector general announced an investigation in October, following criticism by Democratic lawmakers, into reports by Politico that the department suppressed research on the impact of climate change.
Agriculture was responsible for 9 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, according to the EPA.

Resumen: 2020 election lessons so far: It may be time to end caucuses, and it's definitely time to learn patience. It's normal for counting votes to go slowly.

Texto completo: The contrast between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary offers two lessons for the media and the public, especially for the next two contests in Nevada and South Carolina: Put your trust in professional election administrators, and don't expect an immediate announcement of the winner.
The Iowa Democratic Party, not election professionals, ran the caucuses. The party made mistakes at several turns. It transmitted and tabulated results using a new app that turned out to be unreliable. It then compounded those errors by rushing to report results, which appeared incomplete and potentially inaccurate, over the ensuing days.
By contrast, New Hampshire election officials administered the primary. They did it without any hiccups and, importantly, there seemed to be less of a rush to announce the winner.
The Nevada Democratic Party is running Saturday's caucuses, while state election officials are in charge of the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29. Nevada Democrats are trying to learn from the experience of their Iowa counterparts, but the bottom line is unavoidable: The practice of nonprofessionals administering caucuses adds another reason to question the entire caucus system, which is generally undemocratic and unrepresentative to begin with.
Slow results are not 'rigged' results
The other problem is our impatience to know the outcome. Regardless of who is running an election, the news media and the public should let the process play out without demanding immediate results. Spending several days to determine an election winner is a feature, not a bug, of election administration. We must all temper our expectations on election night.
The danger here is that media frenzies over late or even less than immediate results can undermine public faith in our elections. In Iowa, just as the caucuses ended, journalists and political pundits were spreading wild speculation that something was “amiss” just because the state party had not released results quickly enough. President Donald Trump's campaign then picked up on that rampant speculation, with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeting, “Quality control = rigged?”
No. Quality control means that the state Democratic Party did not want to release results that were inaccurate or numbers they would have to amend in the days that followed. How much worse would it be to release initial results that then changed or that they could not verify as abundantly accurate?
We actually know how bad that can be. The Iowa Democratic Party initially released partial numbers the day after the caucuses, with additional results trickling out later that week. A New York Times analysis has revealed that those vote totals had internal inconsistencies. Candidates were justifiably upset.
It is quite likely that some of these mistakes — especially manual tabulation errors — were due to the zeal to release results. Humans are fallible, and even more so when we rush. The state party was under immense pressure, just minutes after the caucuses ended, to tell us who won.
No fatalism allowed: Democrats can beat Trump with a progressive-centrist unity ticket
It was the perfect storm: The party was rolling out a new system in which it reported three sets of results, using a new, untested app to tabulate the numbers from caucus sites, and all in an environment where everyone was clamoring for an immediate announcement of the winner.
Reasonable delays are normal
Of course, delays should not take forever. We don't need to emulate Afghanistan, which just named the winner of a bitterly disputed presidential election that took place five months ago. But a reasonable delay in vote totals should become the norm in America. We should let election administrators — especially those like in Iowa and Nevada who do not do this for a living — take their time to go through the ballots and confirm their accuracy.
Let's remember election night 2018, when some pundits did not wait for West Coast results before deeming Democrats' hoped-for blue wave a bust. Eventually, but not immediately, results from California and other states made the wave a reality. But the normal delay in processing ballots still opened the door for Republicans to speculate about irregularities and plant doubts about the count.
Now imagine election night 2020. It takes time to tabulate results, especially in states with a lot of mail-in ballots. We might not know the winner right away. But if the public and the news media demand immediate vote totals, and if election officials rush in an effort to cede to those demands, then we could be in for a terrible scenario: uncertainty about who actually won the presidential election amid wild allegations of something amiss.
Turning demographics into destiny: Nevada's changing demographics are a road map showing Democrats how to win elections
Let’s instead take a deep breath and let the process work itself out slowly. Delays should not undermine the public’s faith in our election system. Campaigns should not use this media narrative to plant unfounded ideas of electoral shenanigans. Election officials should not rush their processes due to media pressure.
All of this is dangerous for its potential to diminish confidence in our democratic process.
Instead, we should give those who run our elections time to do their jobs and produce accurate results. American democracy won’t break down if we have to wait a few hours or days to find out the winner of the Nevada caucuses or South Carolina primary.

Texto completo: A thriller based on a Joan Didion novel debuts on Netflix. And "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" gets revived on Disney Plus.
What's Streaming
THE LAST THING HE WANTED (2020) Stream on Netflix. The director Dee Rees's 2017 adaptation of the novel "Mudbound," about a black family and a white family in rural Mississippi in the 1940s, picked up four Oscar nominations, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated for the best adapted screenplay Oscar. Like "Mudbound," Rees's latest film, "The Last Thing He Wanted," is also adapted from a novel -- but that's about where the similarities end. Based on Joan Didion's 1996 book of the same name, "The Last Thing He Wanted" is a geopolitical thriller about a Reagan-era journalist (Elena McMahon, played by Anne Hathaway) who goes to Central America to investigate illicit weapons sales. Its cast also includes Ben Affleck (as an American diplomat) and Willem Dafoe (Elena's shady father).
STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS Stream on Disney Plus. Disney's new streaming service had success late last year with "The Mandalorian," its gritty, Western-inflected live-action "Star Wars" series that birthed the toy-mold-ready Baby Yoda. Its next dispatch from the galaxy that George Lucas built is a new season of "The Clone Wars," a 3-D animated series that garnered a loyal fan base when it aired on Cartoon Network for several years beginning in 2008. The series, set during the time period covered by Lucas's 2000s "Star Wars" prequel movies, strikes a lighter tone than its blockbuster counterparts; it's a good choice for younger viewers, or those curious about creative "Star Wars" set pieces outside the confines of live action.
STANDING UP, FALLING DOWN (2020) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and Vudu. Ben Schwartz is in the biggest movie in the country right now, but you won't see his face in it: He voices the digital title creature in "Sonic the Hedgehog." See Schwartz in the flesh in this indie dramedy, in which he plays a failing Los Angeles stand-up comic who moves back home to Long Island, where he forms an unlikely friendship with his dermatologist (Billy Crystal).
What's on TV
THIS WEEK AT THE COMEDY CELLAR 11 p.m. on Comedy Central. Since the main character of "Standing Up, Falling Down" (above) isn't an A-grade comic, don't expect to see any superb stand-up sets in it. For that, consider "This Week at the Comedy Cellar," a series filmed at the Comedy Cellar in New York that features sets from some of the club's regulars. The show returns for a third season on Friday. Past episodes have featured Chris Gethard, Roy Wood Jr. and Bonnie McFarlane.
THE HOURS (2002) 10:30 p.m. on TCM. Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep star in this adaptation of Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1998 novel, about Virginia Woolf (Kidman) and two women whose lives imitate Woolf's art. Stephen Holden called it "deeply moving" in his review for The New York Times, adding that it is "an amazingly faithful screen adaptation of a novel that would seem an unlikely candidate for a movie."

Texto completo: The great New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham, who died in 2016 at age 87, liked to call himself a "fashion historian," a surprisingly stodgy term for someone whose street eye for everyday style -- whether highborn or low-cost, chic or cheeky -- suggested a roving cultural omniscience. In what people wore, he seemed to know (and loved showing us) who we were.
But in that self-descriptor there's more than a hint of charming self-effacement about his devotion and talent, and it's a personality trait on full, winning display in a lively, previously unseen 1994 interview that's the archival center of an equally spirited new documentary about him, "The Times of Bill Cunningham," a first feature made by the man heard off-camera questioning him in the footage, Mark Bozek. (The third voice you'll hear throughout is Sarah Jessica Parker as narrator.)
This is the second documentary about Cunningham, coming nearly a decade after Richard Press' verite on-the-job portrait, the justly acclaimed 2011 film "Bill Cunningham New York." But Bozek's doesn't feel like a rehash, primarily because of how front-and-center its subject is in all his boyish ebullience, the lit-up eyes and toothy smile animating story after story about how a hat-making Boston boy from a conservative Catholic household became a sought-after milliner in high-society designer circles post-World War II and eventually the Olympus-sporting, bicycling chronicler of flamboyance under the sun and finery at night.

Cunningham's beguiling openness, coupled with as many estate-sanctioned photographs from his collection as Bozek can squeeze into the brisk running time, easily overcome a general roughness of assembly -- some jarring music cues, choppily edited montages and an unfortunately discordant instance of name-checking the earlier doc (via Parker's narration) in a way that sounds begrudging and mildly insulting. (We're told, with no evidence, that the spotlight from that film's hoopla discomfited Cunningham, but we also get the choice nugget that at the premiere he chose to stay outside and snap attendees.)
Bozek's background is as a shopping network honcho -- the Bradley Cooper character in David O. Russell's "Joy" is him -- so it's not surprising he knows the entertainment value in centering a biodoc around a warm, engaging figure telling his own life story.
Cunningham's early days creating toppers for moneyed women and famous names who oozed personal style, his catching Paris fashion shows while stationed in France with the Army, and rubbing elbows with living legends at his cramped Carnegie studio (Brando, Bernstein, Mailer) make for an effervescently anecdotal bildungsroman.
Though Cunningham's reputation as an equal-opportunity fashion chronicler is legion, he definitely knew what he did and didn't like. He preferred the sidewalk to runways when looking for how fashion permeated society, natural elegance to camera-conscious posers, and the fashion-conscious to the style-expedient. He viewed many Hollywood stars as illusory figures of superficial glamour who didn't know how to dress in real life, save Gloria Swanson, who "came close."
His gushing excitement over the privilege of his front-line perch for fashion's ever-changing mirror to the world -- whether it's a Diana Vreeland Met exhibit, covering every gay pride parade since the first, or the earthshaking 1973 Battle of Versailles show -- is matched only by the poignance of his occasional weepiness whenever a question of Bozek's addresses Cunningham's own emotions.
At the time Bozek filmed him, AIDS was devastating the fashion world, and a scheduled 10-minute sit-down became an extended, enthusiastic interview until Bozek ran out of videotape. It's fair to assume one reason is that even in so modest a super fan of the sartorial as Cunningham, his recognizing that life, like fashion, is both monumental and fleeting was enough to get a passionate witness talking, sometimes through tears. And for that, we can be grateful for a record such as "The Times of Bill Cunningham."

Trump Aide At the Center Of a Rumor Is Transferred

Texto completo: The White House "does not put any stock" in the rumor that Victoria Coates, the aide, wrote an Op-Ed essay in The Times in 2018, an administration official said.
WASHINGTON -- The White House is transferring a senior national security aide who fell under suspicion of writing an anonymous insider account of dissent within the Trump administration, the latest of several senior personnel moves stemming from questions of loyalty to President Trump.
Victoria Coates, Mr. Trump's deputy national security adviser, will move on Monday to the Department of Energy, where she will serve as a senior adviser to Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette.
Robert C. O'Brien, the national security adviser, announced on Thursday the staff shift in a statement, saying her move was intended to "ensure the close alignment of energy policy with national security objectives." The move was first reported by Axios.
But current and former administration officials said Ms. Coates, who managed Middle East and North Africa issues on the National Security Council, had been targeted by a whisper campaign among some pro-Trump conservatives that she was Anonymous, an official who wrote a September 2018 Op-Ed essay for The New York Times that was expanded into a book that was published last year.
The Times identified Anonymous as only "a senior official in the Trump administration." The unnamed official, whose identity is known to the senior leadership of the Times editorial page department but not to their counterparts in the news department or to reporters who cover the White House, has managed to remain anonymous for more than a year in spite of frenzied efforts to uncover the person's identity. It is unclear whether the person still works in government.
Ms. Coates's allies dispute the notion that she is the unnamed author, who wrote that many Trump officials, including the author, "are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations." Mr. Trump and his senior advisers were enraged by the essay and have made efforts to identify who wrote it.
A senior administration official who declined to be named said that the White House "does not put any stock in the suggestion" that Ms. Coates was the author of the book and the Times opinion essay. The official said her transfer had been in the works for several weeks.
But the accusations against her had become a significant distraction. Last week, as rumors circulated about her job status, Ms. Coates was scheduled to appear on a panel at the conservative Hudson Institute. She never showed up, providing no advance explanation.
Earlier this month, the literary agents for Anonymous issued a statement vehemently denying that Ms. Coates, an art historian who had worked with them on her 2016 book about art and democracy, was the author in question.
Known as a hawk on Middle East issues, including Israel and Iran, Ms. Coates previously served as a foreign policy aide to Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. She has held multiple national security jobs in the Trump administration and was promoted to deputy national security adviser shortly after Mr. O'Brien took over the National Security Council last fall.
Her departure came shortly after the dismissal from the council of Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, who testified against Mr. Trump during impeachment hearings in the House, along with Mr. Vindman's brother, also a national security staffer. The two men were reassigned to the Department of Defense, from which they had been detailed to the National Security Council.
Those dismissals and Ms. Coates's reassignment are unrelated to a downsizing of the council's staff that Mr. O'Brien initiated. Mr. O'Brien has said the staff cuts -- trimming the agency's size from 176 positions to less than 115 by the end of this month -- are necessary to streamline operations, but critics see the moves as convenient cover for pushing out officials of uncertain loyalty to Mr. Trump.
"While I'm sad to lose an important member of our team," Mr. O'Brien said in a statement, "Victoria will be a big asset to Secretary Brouillette as he executes the president's energy security policy priorities."

'TUMACHO' at the Connelly Theater (in previews; opens on Feb. 22). Ethan Lipton's mostly western musical, which Ben Brantley called an "impeccably inane horse opera," rides back in town.

Last Chance
'GRAND HORIZONS' at Hayes Theater (closes on March 1). Bess Wohl's comedy of divorce, directed by Leigh Silverman, calls it quits. Jesse Green questioned the wisdom of writing "a boulevard comedy for a cul-de-sac age." However, he had particular praise for Jane Alexander, writing that "you haven't lived until you've heard a woman who once played Eleanor Roosevelt sing the praises of cunnilingus."
2st.com
'MAC BETH' at the Frederick Loewe Theater (closes on Feb. 22). A gaggle of teen girls leave Dunsinane as Erica Schmidt's reimagining of the Scottish tragedy closes. Laura Collins-Hughes wrote that the play's power lies not in its true-crime-inspired violence, but in "watching a group of girls meet Shakespeare on their own electric terms -- with ferocity, abandon and the occasional wild dance break."
212-772-4448, huntertheaterproject.org
'MY NAME IS LUCY BARTON' at Samuel J. Friedman Theater (closes on Feb. 29). Rona Munro's adaptation of Elizabeth Strout's glimmering 2016 novel, directed by Richard Eyre and starring a scarf-wrapped Laura Linney, reaches its final paragraphs. Ben Brantley wrote that "as embodied with middle-American forthrightness" by Linney, the play's title character "may be the most translucent figure now on a New York stage."

Texto completo: In her first public remarks since she was forced to resign, Caroline Baumann said an inquiry that focused on her wedding was unfair and colored by sexism.
In her first public remarks since she was forced to resign two weeks ago, the former director of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum called the investigation into the circumstances of her wedding, which led to her ouster, a "sham" colored by sexism.
"This is not how we treat human beings," the former director, Caroline Baumann, said in comments released Thursday through her lawyer, Luke Nikas.
Ms. Baumann, 53, stepped down as director on Feb. 7 after the Smithsonian's inspector general found she had violated conflict-of-interest rules in connection with her September 2018 wedding. The reason for her forced resignation has previously been reported, but new details about the investigation emerged on Thursday in an inspector general's report obtained by The New York Times.
The report said that Ms. Baumann had used, or created an appearance that she had used, her "Smithsonian position for private gain" by obtaining free use of a Hamptons property for the ceremony, and giving the nonprofit affiliated with the property free use of Cooper Hewitt spaces for meetings; by obtaining a discounted wedding dress from a Brooklyn designer and then giving the designer a free ticket to a Cooper Hewitt gala; and by using Cooper Hewitt staff members to help publicize her wedding.
Ms. Baumann has disputed the report, which Mr. Nikas said "contains frivolous accusations that we will easily disprove with the documents and the witnesses involved."
Seven of the 27 Cooper Hewitt board members have quit in protest. Her supporters contend that at worst, Ms. Baumann had made some ill-advised but innocent decisions, and that the Smithsonian had treated Ms. Baumann too inflexibly and bureaucratically in making her leave.
Though the board has primarily an advisory role, with major decisions made by the Smithsonian secretary, Lonnie G. Bunch III, several trustees said they should have been consulted before Ms. Baumann, the director of the Upper East Side museum since 2013, was pushed out.
"I learned nothing I didn't know, except some more details of the investigators' cluelessness and shoddiness," the author Kurt Andersen, one of the trustees who resigned, said of the inspector general's findings. "I still find it incomprehensible that the secretary decided these supposed infractions merited termination, and also that he didn't seek advice from the board about this."
The Smithsonian, which was created by Congress and is partly funded by taxpayers, is not technically a government agency, but it maintains policies similar to those of many federal offices, including conflict-of-interest rules. Like many agencies, it also has an inspector general to investigate potential wrongdoing.
"The Smithsonian abides by a code of ethical conduct, which demands the highest standards of honesty, integrity, professionalism, and loyalty to the institution," the Smithsonian said in a statement Friday morning. "As a public institution subject to federal oversight, we must maintain a shared commitment to these core values and an expectation of ethical conduct in all of our activities."
The inspector general's report said its investigation was triggered by a complaint, from a source it did not identify, regarding Ms. Baumann's wedding and other matters.
Investigators noted that Ms. Baumann had paid $ 750 for a dress from a Brooklyn designer whose gowns, according to her website, begin at $ 3,000. The designer, Samantha Sleeper, said in an interview with The Times that the price was fair because it was a simple dress she made herself, not an extravagant gown, and that Ms. Baumann had not promised her any favors.
But the inspector general's report noted that shortly after her wedding, Ms. Baumann asked her staff to give Ms. Sleeper a free ticket, worth $ 1,700, to the annual National Design Awards gala that the museum held the following month. Ms. Baumann said she had not granted the ticket as a trade for the dress, and investigators noted that more than 100 of the nearly 500 people at the gala had received free tickets, which the museum often gave out if seats needed to be filled.
Nevertheless, the inspector general concluded that the price of the dress and the ensuing free ticket gave "an appearance that these actions were a quid pro quo," a violation of Smithsonian conflict-of-interest policy.
The inspector general also faulted Ms. Baumann for receiving free use of an East Hampton property affiliated with a nonprofit, LongHouse Reserve, for the wedding ceremony. The property usually charges upward of $ 25,000 for events, according to the report, though officials of the nonprofit have characterized the ceremony as a small informal affair; the formal reception was held elsewhere, on Shelter Island. Ms. Baumann told the inspector general that she had asked to use the LongHouse property because she was friends with its founder, the textile designer Jack Lenor Larsen.
Ms. Baumann allowed LongHouse to use Cooper Hewitt rooms for two meetings, the first occurring nine months before the wedding and the second two months after the wedding, without charging rent.
According to the inspector general's report, the value of the two rentals was $ 33,875 combined. It reached that figure by noting that corporations were required to donate at least $ 20,000 to use the spaces LongHouse used; the rest was based on hourly fees Cooper Hewitt typically charges companies that rent museum spaces.
Though the director has the power to waive rental fees for Cooper Hewitt rooms, the short time between her wedding and the LongHouse meetings "created an appearance that Baumann gave preferential treatment" and "that these actions were a quid pro quo," the report said. It added that she should have reported the use of the Hamptons property as a gift.
Investigators also faulted Ms. Baumann for using museum staff members and contractors to help publicize her wedding to the news media. Ms. Baumann said she had done so because the Cooper Hewitt's publicity consultants had encouraged the museum to "shed more light" on Ms. Baumann as a person. The inspector general, however, said that Ms. Baumann should have checked with a supervisor or an ethics counselor before using museum staff members for a personal event.
In her remarks on Thursday, Ms. Baumann seized on Ms. Sleeper's account of her interview with the inspector general's agents. According to Ms. Sleeper, one of the agents, a man, said he had heard that Ms. Baumann was a "bitch" and a "'Devil Wears Prada' type."
"The agent at the center of this used derogatory, sexist language," Ms. Baumann said. "He was overtly discriminatory to me and to others, and produced a sham report."
"As a society," she said, "it is not acceptable to treat people this way."
The inspector general's office has declined to comment on the complaint about the agent's remarks, but a lawyer for the office said last week that the office adhered to integrity standards.
The inspector general also investigated the museum's hiring of Ms. Baumann's boyfriend, now husband, John Stewart Malcolmson, for a $ 5,000 graphic design job in 2017. Investigators did not conclude that Ms. Baumann directed the hiring of Mr. Malcolmson, a branding and graphic design consultant, but the inspector general said she should have disclosed the fact that she had a relationship with a museum contractor in her annual financial disclosure report.

Texto completo: Auction houses had been competing for the sale of the collection. Three galleries, Acquavella, Gagosian and Pace, will sell his works as well as present an exhibition this spring.
Fast on the heels of mourning Donald B. Marron after his abrupt death in December from what appeared to be a heart attack, auction houses started competing for his impressive art collection, which includes two major Picassos, as well as works by Mark Rothko, Cy Twombly and Willem de Kooning.
But in a highly unusual development on Tuesday, the auction houses were thwarted entirely when three major galleries announced that they would share the sale of the collection.
The galleries -- Acquavella, Gagosian and Pace -- will jointly organize a New York exhibition in the spring, dividing the works into three significant phases of Mr. Marron's collecting: the 1960s and 1970s; as a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art since 1975; and in building the collection of the investment bank Paine Webber while he was chief executive between 1980 and 2000.
The decision by Mr. Marron's widow, Catherine Marron, is a blow to the auction world, particularly when it is coming off lackluster sales in London last week, inventory is low and Sotheby's is trying to establish itself under new private ownership.
Mr. Marron's will directed that his collection could be sold "at public or private sale" and that, if sold publicly, "at either Sotheby's Inc. or Christie's as my executors shall in their absolute discretion determine," according to a copy obtained by The New York Times. In the will, Mr. Marron also requested that his executors consult with Glenn D. Lowry, MoMA's director, concerning the disposition of "my paintings, drawings, prints and similar works of art."
The Marron exhibition, which will be presented at Pace and Gagosian from April 24 to May 16, will include works from the family collection as well as loans of artworks owned by institutions. In addition to major modernists, the collector supported contemporary artists like Mark Bradford, Mark Grotjahn and Laura Owens.
A book from Phaidon Press will accompany the show.
The unorthodox project is a testament to "the lifelong relationships that can develop between collectors and dealers," Marc Glimcher, president and chief executive of Pace, said in a statement, "and the role our galleries have played in supporting Marron's vision."
The dealer Larry Gagosian in his statement called Mr. Marron "one of the most forward-thinking collectors of his time," adding that "he would frequently see something in a work of art that others did not."
Bill Acquavella of Acquavella said he first met Mr. Marron in the early 1970s. "It was quite clear to me that Don had a special sensitivity for collecting and appreciating fine art," he said in a statement. "Over the years Don not only became a valued client, but a great friend."

Mulvaney Says He Often Disagrees With Trump (Just Never Publicly)

Texto completo: The acting chief of staff, addressing a crowd of several hundred in England, spoke freely about the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said in a wide-ranging discussion on Wednesday night that he disagreed with President Trump "every single day," mocked a fellow administration adviser and accused Republicans of hypocrisy over the budget deficit.
Mr. Mulvaney, addressing a crowd of several hundred during a question-and-answer session with the Oxford Union in England, spoke freely about the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and denounced the so-called deep state as well as his predecessor, John F. Kelly. And he described the White House as functional and improved, despite near-daily descriptions of a chaotic and often toxic atmosphere.
The comments were first reported by The Washington Post.
Early on in the conversation, audio of which was provided to The New York Times by someone in attendance, Mr. Mulvaney rejected the frequent assessment that Mr. Trump preferred to be surrounded by people who agree with him.
"I disagree with the president every single day," Mr. Mulvaney said. "You just don't hear about it -- that's not my job."
"The president looks for people who disagree with him, and disagree with each other," Mr. Mulvaney noted, adding that Mr. Trump "will sit back and watch" as aides "go at it."
"He's the judge and he's the jury," Mr. Mulvaney said. He cited as an example the president's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who has clashed with Mr. Trump over tariffs.
Mr. Kudlow made his name in television "being one of the foremost free traders in the country," Mr. Mulvaney said. "He's now on TV regularly defending our tariff positions."
That Mr. Kelly, who stepped down as chief of staff in 2018, considered his job as being a moderating influence on Mr. Trump was at odds with how Mr. Mulvaney himself viewed the role.
"It's our job to agree with the president all the time publicly," Mr. Mulvaney said. "Disagree with him privately."
Addressing the budget deficit, which reached almost $ 1 trillion last year, Mr. Mulvaney, a deficit hawk when he was a Republican congressman from South Carolina, was surprisingly candid about his party.
"My party is very interested in deficits when there is a Democrat in the White House. The worst thing in the whole world is deficits when Barack Obama was the president," said Mr. Mulvaney, who still holds the title of director of the Office of Management and Budget. "Then Donald Trump became president, and we're a lot less interested as a party."
Mr. Mulvaney also broached the Ukraine matter at the heart of the impeachment proceedings and insisted that Democrats had no real interest in seeking testimony and were merely putting on a publicity stunt.
"There's a story you don't know about impeachment," he said, adding that Democrats leading the inquiry like Representative Adam B. Schiff never had an interest in substantive interviews with witnesses.
That he and John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, were among the first people subpoenaed for testimony proved that, Mr. Mulvaney said, as Democrats should have known that those efforts would result in a court battle as was the case in previous impeachments.
"We were the least likely to ever go down and testify," he said, citing executive privilege because of their proximity to the president. "We did not withhold information and fail to comply." He falsely claimed that Democrats had not sought a subpoena from Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, whom Mr. Mulvaney claimed could have disclosed many things that do not fall under attorney-client privilege.
Mr. Mulvaney acknowledged erring in a now infamous news briefing in October, when he said that the president suspended $ 391 million in aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations into his political rivals. He said he did not believe that he had made those remarks until aides showed him video afterward.
"I had answered that question a hundred times before," he said, insisting he had simply tripped up amid repeated questions from the news media. The president may have touched on other issues, Mr. Mulvaney added, like his interest in the hacked Democratic National Committee server from 2016, but that "the restrictions on the money" were not about that.
Describing his time as chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mr. Mulvaney alternately praised and excoriated civil servants, saying the "deep state" was real and claiming that he was besieged by people who were resisting what he described as Mr. Trump's agenda.
The majority of the 1,700 employees he said were in the bureau "challenged him at every turn," he said. "My guess is 1,690 of them voted for Hillary Clinton for president, and 1,600 of them came to work every single day trying to make sure the president failed."
He did not elaborate how he arrived at those figures, but said the laws of the bureaucracy made it nearly impossible for him to fire anyone.
Later, Mr. Mulvaney was harsher about civil servants, saying that if they do not want to enact administration policy, they should quit or run for office themselves.
"You cannot have this sort of cognitive dissonance; you cannot have this sort of passive resistance in an administration," he said. "Our system breaks down if you have that."
The news media was also a target, as Mr. Mulvaney recounted in detail how a journalist had incorrectly reported that he was golfing with Mr. Trump when it was actually Jack Nicklaus, the famed golfer. Without acknowledging the times the president or administration officials have relayed false information, Mr. Mulvaney suggested people should be leery of news accounts.
"Sometimes it could be the truth and sometimes it could be" false, he said.
Mr. Mulvaney also discussed the administration's restrictive immigration policies, including the president's signature campaign promise to build a wall along the southwestern border.
"Does it solve the problem? No it doesn't," he said. "Does it slow it down? Yes it does."
He disputed the White House's reputation as anti-immigrant, noting: "We are desperate, desperate for more people."
"We created 215,000 jobs last month," he added. "We are running out of people to fuel the economic growth." He said the country needed "more immigrants" but wanted them in a "legal" fashion.
While the president often talks about his border wall, he has at times mentioned "a door" in that wall. People forget the door in considering the administration's stance toward immigration, Mr. Mulvaney said.
As the speech ended, he addressed why he has remained the "acting" White House chief of staff since he was named to the post at the end of 2018, pointing to his continued role at the Office of Management and Budget.
"Because it's a $ 20,000 pay cut," he said, explaining why he has not made a change.

Texto completo: The horrors of Nazi occupation in World War II are seen through the eyes of a Soviet teenager in Elem Klimov's newly restored "Come and See," from 1985.
There have been many Russian movies on the subject of World War II but none more ferocious than Elem Klimov's "Come and See." Seldom if ever have wartime atrocities been depicted so vividly -- and with such hallucinated fervor.
Released in 1985 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Soviet victory, now newly restored and playing at Film Forum from Feb. 21 through March 3, "Come and See" shows Nazi-occupied Byelorussia (now Belarus) through the eyes of an increasingly traumatized 14-year-old boy, Flyora (Aleksei Kravchenko).
The title comes from the Book of Revelation. The first words spoken are "Hey, are you crazy!" The final sequence, a frenzied assemblage of photographs and newsreel clips in which time speeds up and goes in reverse, defies description.
"Come and See" begins with a series of mysterious encounters as Flyora finds a rifle, bids his frantic mother farewell, and sets off to join the partisans in the forest. The light is unearthly. The Steadicam seldom stops moving through a Boschian hellscape, filled with unseen voices and offscreen dangers. At various times, Flyora is deafened by explosions or rendered mute with horror. Before the movie ends, his hair has turned gray and his prematurely wizened face has frozen in a mask of terror.

The camera calms down and comes in close for the film's central atrocity. Music blares, dogs bark as, having taken a town, a squadron of drunken German soldiers rounds up the inhabitants and parades them into a wooden barn to meet a fiery doom. Writing in The New York Times, the reviewer Walter Goodman said that the scene goes on so long that "you are left with a feeling of being worked on." That's one way to put it. A postscript mentions that, during their scorched-earth retreat, the Germans torched 628 Byelorussian villages.
The script, which had to wait eight years for official approval, was by Klimov and the Byelorussian writer Ales Adamovich, a teenage partisan fighter during World War II. Klimov, six years younger than Adamovich, was 10 when he and his family were evacuated from Stalingrad. "The city was ablaze up to the top of the sky," he once said, adding with regard to "Come and See" that, "Had I included everything I knew and shown the whole truth, even I could not have watched it." One wonders how he was able to stage it.
More horrifically antiwar than romantically partisan or patriotic in the tradition of Soviet combat films, "Come and See" ends with intimations of nuclear catastrophe, presaging what came to be called the cinema of glasnost. The movie won the grand prize at the 1985 Moscow Film Festival and the next year, Klimov was elected first secretary of the Soviet Film Makers Union. As such he was largely responsible for taking banned movies off the shelf. The most notorious of these was his own, a floridly expressionist account of Czar Nicholas II's final days, "Agoniya," released here as "Rasputin."
Although involved with subsequent projects, Klimov, who died in 2003, never made another movie. "Come and See" would be his -- some would say "the" -- last word.

Klobuchar Suddenly Rises To Rival Worth Attacking

Texto completo: Ms. Klobuchar was helped by newspaper endorsements and a relative lack of scrutiny from other candidates -- until Wednesday night's debate.
LAS VEGAS -- In the nearly two weeks since her standout debate performance in New Hampshire, the momentum behind Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had encountered nary a pothole.
With a stack of endorsements from local and national newspapers lured by her centrist platform, a surprising third-place finish in New Hampshire and a cash infusion of $ 12 million, Ms. Klobuchar was suddenly awash in "top-tier candidate" punditry chatter and attracting a fresh -- and often first -- look from voters.
But with that sudden success came a withering torrent of criticism on the debate stage Wednesday night from rivals like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind.
Both of them poll ahead of Ms. Klobuchar nationally and in some key Super Tuesday states like California, but they are seeking to halt her rise and win over her supporters before that pivotal day, as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont threatens to build an insurmountable delegate lead.
"It's like a Post-it note," Ms. Warren said, as she criticized Ms. Klobuchar's health care platform. "Insert plan here."
"You voted to make English the national language," Mr. Buttigieg said, as he turned to face Ms. Klobuchar, standing to his left. "Do you know what message that sends, in as multilingual a state as Nevada, to immigrants?"
In Ms. Klobuchar, who campaigns on protecting and improving the Affordable Care Act and has deeply personal stories about fighting for longer hospital stays after giving birth, Ms. Warren faces a new competitor for suburban, college-educated women, largely moderates, who have formed a new and crucial bloc of support for Democrats after President Trump's election.
Mr. Buttigieg sees a candidate running an overall similar playbook to his -- holding town halls and interviews on Fox News, knocking down "Medicare for All" proposals, making direct appeals through a Midwestern lens to independents and some Republicans -- and who is closing in on his rise as a moderate alternative to Mr. Sanders.
"I think people make a mistake when they say that Warren and Sanders are the ones competing in a lane, because the voters that are going to put Warren in a position to be competitive are deciding not between Sanders and Warren, but between Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Warren," said Addisu Demissie, a Democratic strategist and the former presidential campaign manager for Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.
"The three of them, I think, are in a fight in a lot of ways for those college-educated voters," he said.
Mr. Demissie said that Mr. Sanders's passionate and devoted following made up roughly a third of the Democratic base, and that pulling voters away from him would be nearly impossible. So the other three, he said, would most likely look to "the college-educated, primarily white but not exclusively white voters" to build their support.
In New Hampshire, Ms. Klobuchar narrowly carried the college-educated vote, according to exit polls.
Ms. Klobuchar has cited her steady stream of newspaper endorsements as evidence that she can appeal to those who hope to see a more moderate candidate take on Mr. Trump.
Though only a single metric with unknown impact on voters, to look at the endorsements Ms. Klobuchar has racked up -- nine so far, double the amount of most of her rivals -- is to get a window into how Ms. Klobuchar long laid the foundation for what appeared to be a very rapid rise from obscurity to winning national delegates.
Sitting in front of largely white and well-educated editorial boards across the country, made up of journalists who often have lengthy résumés of their own, Ms. Klobuchar was able to construct a portrait of her candidacy as one that was built on a bipartisan record in Congress and can appeal to independents.
"Her electability and her bipartisan history of being able to navigate the Washington system was one of the biggest factors in our endorsement," said Brendan McQuaid, the publisher of The New Hampshire Union Leader. "She's been down there and done it and known the ins and outs of how Capitol Hill works, which is something that is crucial for a functioning government."
The numerous editorials praising Ms. Klobuchar's competence and experience perhaps served as a signal to her rivals that they couldn't let her record go unchallenged on the debate stage.
Mr. Buttigieg, for example, quickly and aggressively seized on an embarrassing gaffe by Ms. Klobuchar, when she could not name the president of Mexico during an interview with Telemundo.
He attacked her votes for many of Mr. Trump's judicial nominees during the first two years of his presidency, as well as her support of Mr. Trump's pick to head Customs and Border Protection, someone Mr. Buttigieg said was "one of the architects of the family separation policy."
Ms. Klobuchar poses a threat to Mr. Buttigieg's Midwestern appeal, and her pitch that her roots in the Midwest would help win back the heartland states that voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 was met with wide agreement from editorial boards.
"Electability, we understand the electoral map," said Dan Borenstein, the editorial page editor of The East Bay Times in California. "And as the editorial says to Californians, the general election isn't going to be decided here. It's going to be decided in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, probably."
Left unsaid by many of the boards, however, was Ms. Klobuchar's dismal polling with people of color, particularly black and Latino voters. Her endorsements from newspapers in Iowa and New Hampshire, states with largely white populations, were more concerned with her immediate future in those contests, and the national newspapers believed she could make up lost ground.
"That is a big concern," said Lisa Falkenberg, the vice president-editor of opinion at the Houston Chronicle, who said Ms. Klobuchar needed to be making more direct appeals to black voters in particular regarding health care. But, she argued, there's still time.
"Realistically, black voters are known to be pragmatic," Ms. Falkenberg said. "They are also looking for a candidate that can beat Donald Trump."
Ms. Klobuchar also faced tough questioning Wednesday from Chuck Todd, one of the debate moderators, over her record as a county prosecutor in Minnesota, particularly whether a black teenager was wrongly convicted of murder during her tenure as the Hennepin County attorney.
Framed as a question about whether her record as county prosecutor would erode trust with black and Latino voters, Ms. Klobuchar defended her handling of the case, reiterated her call for it to be reviewed, and pledged to work to earn support.
"I have the support of African-Americans in my community in every election," she said. "I had strong support and strong support of leadership. And that's because I earned it. And this is going to be on me to earn it."
Here in Nevada, as Ms. Klobuchar seeks to remain relevant in a state with a decidedly diverse population, her campaign began running an ad in Spanish that pointed to yet another endorsement, from The Las Vegas Sun.
In fact, nearly every ad run by the Klobuchar campaign in the past few weeks has touted one of her newspaper endorsements. Her recent seven-figure ad buy in seven Super Tuesday states features two new ads that boast of her endorsements from The New York Times -- which she shared with Ms. Warren -- and The Sun.
Editors at The Sun recognized that Ms. Klobuchar, as well as Mr. Buttigieg, faced an uphill battle with Latino voters in the state. But searching to identify something that could help her break through, they pointed to yet another facet of her experience in Washington: her work on immigration reform.
"Her work on comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate was something that struck us as being commendable, especially in southern Nevada where that issue is so critical for us," said Ric Anderson, the paper's editorial page editor.
He added that he thought her relative lack of national stature was one reason she hadn't made inroads among people of color in Nevada.
"We didn't really necessarily focus on the appeal to minority voters because of the uphill climb that she and Mayor Pete Buttigieg had just in getting where they are now in terms of recognition," Mr. Anderson said. "We do see potential there."

Texto completo: For his latest project, the writer best known for "The Da Vinci Code" is turning his attention to a younger audience.
Before he became a best-selling writer, Dan Brown was an aspiring musician. In 1989, he self-produced an album of children's music he arranged on synthesizers, titled "Musica Animalia." It sold around 500 copies, and Brown soon forgot about it.
He had better luck as a novelist, with page-turners like "The Da Vinci Code," "The Lost Symbol" and other thrillers that collectively have more than 220 million copies in print.
Now, three decades later, Brown is reviving his musical career with a hybrid children's album and picture book that grew out of the music and poems he wrote for "Musica Animalia."
The book, "Wild Symphony," which Rodale Kids plans to release in September, is aimed at 3- to 7-year-olds. The story features a mouse conductor who recruits other animals to perform in his orchestra, dispensing wisdom about the value of patience, kindness and respect along the way. Readers can listen to the musical accompaniments for each page with a smartphone app that uses augmented reality to scan the page and play the music for "Bouncing Kangaroo," "Wondrous Whale" and "Brilliant Bat."
Brown says the story and music were inspired by classical works like "Peter and the Wolf" and "The Carnival of the Animals." He is also simultaneously releasing an album of the music that he composed, performed by the Zagreb Festival Orchestra in Croatia.
While it's somewhat surprising that Brown -- who is known for his adrenaline-fueled and occasionally bloody suspense novels -- is writing for the pre-literate crowd, "Wild Symphony" has some of his hallmarks. In classic Dan Brown fashion, there are clues and puzzles sprinkled throughout the book; observant readers will find letters of the alphabet floating in the illustrations of blue whales, cheetahs, kangaroos and tropical fish. (The letters form anagrams that spell a musical instrument when placed in the right order.)
Brown was closely involved in the process, from choosing the illustrator, Susan Batori, to overseeing the development of the app, said Mallory Loehr, the senior vice president and publisher of the Random House Books for Young Readers Group. He traveled to Croatia to work with the Zagreb orchestra on the recording.
Music has long been a favorite mode of expression for Brown. As a child, he played piano to entertain himself (his parents wouldn't allow a TV in the house). After college, he tried to make it as a musician. He founded his own record company, called Dalliance. He later moved to Los Angeles to become a singer-songwriter and pianist, and joined the National Academy of Songwriters. He still plays the piano nearly every day.
Brown wasn't planning to make a splashy public return to his musical roots. The project came about in 2018, when his friend Bob Lord, the chief executive of PARMA Recordings, rediscovered his long-lost children's album and asked Brown if he had thought about having the music performed by an orchestra. Brown gave a recording of "Musica Animalia" and the text to his literary agent, and proposed the dual book and album. To make the story cohere, Brown wrote more poems and musical pieces and added the mouse character to guide the reader and give the story an arc.
The orchestral music was recorded by PARMA Recordings, and is being distributed by the classical-music publisher Boosey & Hawkes.
"Wild Symphony" will be Brown's biggest musical release to date: Rodale is printing 150,000 copies of the book, and rights have sold in 27 countries.

RONALD K. BROWN/EVIDENCE at the Joyce Theater (Feb. 25-26, 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 27-28, 8 p.m.; through March 1). For decades, Brown has created profound choreography that grapples with life and faith, and his exuberant blend of contemporary and African dance can feel like physical prayer. He celebrates his company's 35th anniversary with a program that includes "High Life" (2000), which begins with a depiction of a slave auction; "Grace" (2000), a work made for the Alvin Ailey company in which a woman in white welcomes people to heaven; and "Mercy," the companion piece to "Grace," which premiered last year and is set to music by Meshell Ndegeocello. Wednesday's gala performance also includes an excerpt from "Open Door" with the Ailey dancers Linda Celeste Sims and Glenn Allen Sims.

The 1928 ballet "Apollo," about the Greek god and his muses, is a neoclassical gem that put George Balanchine on the map. In "Apollon," this Austrian choreographer takes that work as a reference point and gives it a brash, feminist twist. Five women with a spectrum of body types, at times topless, critique the myth of the ideal feminine body as perpetuated by ballet. They do so through a series of sideshow acts and wacky scenarios -- an occult fitness studio, a cyborg bullfight -- drawing on, among other things, Holzinger's fascination with Coney Island's colorful past.

SARA JULI at Dixon Place (Feb. 21-22 and 27, 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 28, 7 p.m.). Within the setting of a pink, overly cheery bathroom, Juli dons curlers and a frilly robe for her new solo dance-theater piece, "Burnt Out Wife," a comedic autobiographical reflection on a long list of marital issues (and grievances) like monogamy, loneliness and intimacy. With punch lines aplenty, the show, co-presented by the American Dance Festival, has the feeling of a stand-up routine. The accompanying frantic gestures enhance Juli's take on the roller coaster of being in a relationship.

JAEWOO JUNG at the 92nd Street Y (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.; Feb. 22, 4 and 8 p.m.). The 92Y's Harkness Dance Festival kicks off with "Perfect Skill," a work by this Korean choreographer in collaboration with Braveman, the dance collective he co-founded in 2017. The piece occurs largely in the dark, with bodies -- or parts of them -- illuminated by flashlights. At the center of "Perfect Skill" is a male duet, performed naked, which is more farcical than fanciful. Also on the program is the solo "Uninhabited Island," an almost vaudevillian work featuring Jung and a small table that becomes both support and nemesis as he is flung around by unseen forces.

CHERYLYN LAVAGNINO at the DiMenna Center for Classical Music (Feb. 25-26, 7:30 p.m.). Edward Hopper's paintings captured a romantic loneliness, finding ominous beauty in scenes of collective isolation. In "Tales of Hopper" (2019), Lavagnino brings those scenes to life and puts their melancholy in motion to original music by Martin Bresnick. Performances of 2016's "Veiled," a dance for six women that depicts, as the choreographer puts it, "women who carry themselves with strength and dignity through an unjust world," and an excerpt from 2012's "Triptych" are also on the bill.

NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.; Feb. 22, 2 and 8 p.m.; Feb. 23, 3 p.m.; Feb. 25-27, 7:30 p.m.; through March 1). Performances of Peter Martins's "Swan Lake" continue through Sunday. Then the company introduces two programs that it believes best represent its identity: "Classic NYCB I," on Tuesday, consists of "Haieff Divertimento" and "Episodes" by George Balanchine, "Concertino" by Jerome Robbins and the lovely "Rodeo: Four Dance Episodes" by Justin Peck. The "Classic NYCB II" bill on Wednesday and Feb. 27 features Robbins's "In G Major," Christopher Wheeldon's "DGV: Danse à Grande Vitesse" and Peck's new work, set to music by Nico Muhly.

WORKS AND PROCESS at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (Feb. 23, 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 24, 7:30 p.m.). When it premiered in 1877, the ballet "La Bayadère" was on trend in exoticizing India, where the story of the captured temple dancer Nikiya takes place. Today, its setting and characters are considered problematic. For his new production of the tale, the former American Ballet Theater star and current Pennsylvania Ballet artistic director Angel Corella addresses those issues and offers excerpts (on Sunday). On Monday, the dancer and choreographer Caleb Teicher presents a preview of his new work devoted to swing dance, complete with Lindy Hoppers and big-band backup.

Texto completo: Also this week, booze and global warming
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
Scientists say solving climate change means significantly reducing the use of fossil fuels. That's not how many Republicans in Congress see things, though.
A new House Republican climate agenda, the first part of which was announced last week, includes an ambitious tree-planting program. It also calls for tax breaks to help encourage the development of technology to capture emissions from coal and gas plants. Measures to bolster energy storage and advanced nuclear technology are planned, too.
One thing the Republican climate plans won't do, though, is cut the use of fossil fuels most responsible for heating up the planet. Party leaders openly acknowledge that they hope to solve global warming without sacrificing coal, gas or oil.
"I think that's possible" said Representative David B. McKinley, a West Virginia Republican. Mr. McKinley is writing bipartisan legislation with Representative Kurt Schrader, an Oregon Democrat, that would fund the development of carbon capture technology in exchange for delaying federal regulations for a decade.
Sitting in his Capitol Hill office beneath a photograph of a coal miner holding a young girl's hand, Mr. McKinley said that, in parts of his district, much of the economy is linked to the local coal plant.
"If they close, what impact will that have on the schools?" he asked. "The first responders? The health care workers?"
"Fossil fuels aren't the enemy," said Representative Garret Graves of Louisiana, the top Republican on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. "It's emissions. So, let's devise strategies that are based on emissions strategies, not based on eliminating fossil fuels."
That approach has a number of political advantages for Republicans. It allows them to attack Democratic-led proposals like the Green New Deal while offering ideas of their own. And the solutions they propose will slowly reduce emissions.
The problem, scientists say, is that those proposals are not nearly enough to achieve what's needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change: A reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions of 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
"There isn't any way to make the math solve without a substantial direct reduction in fossil fuels," said Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University.
Planting one trillion trees, an idea President Trump recently embraced, could absorb as much as 205 gigatons of carbon emissions. But it would take many decades for new trees to reach maturity.
Carbon capture technology could eventually sequester as much as 2 gigatons a year in the United States. But that's less than half of the approximately 5.5 gigatons emitted annually, and getting to even that level would also require decades and billions of dollars, Mr. Jenkins said.
Julio Friedmann, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center for Global Energy Policy who was a top official in the Department of Energy under President Barack Obama, said all of the options Republicans have outlined would be needed, but it's still necessary to sharply reduce fossil fuels.
"Climate change is an existential threat," Dr. Friedmann said. "I see no reason to tie one's arm behind your back on anything. We are in the fight of our lives and we need absolutely every option."
He called the Republican plans "positive" for helping to build consensus around greater climate ambition. But, Dr. Friedmann added, they're "still not a substitute for the rest."
If you did dry January this year, you probably reduced your carbon footprint without knowing it. That's because alcohol production and distribution can be quite energy intensive. So, what if you want to reduce your environmental footprint but you're not quite ready to hop on the wagon and stay there?
Whatever your poison, one of the most important things you can do, for your health and for the planet, is drink in moderation. Even if you don't cut out the booze, keep it reasonable. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that means one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.
Beyond that, it helps to know the facts about your drink of choice.
Broadly speaking, liquor tends to be more environmentally sustainable per unit. "The more concentrated they are, the less impact they have," Alissa Kendall, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis, said of alcoholic beverages.
Drinkers typically get more mileage out of a bottle of spirits than wine or beer. That's especially true if you drink to get a buzz. Simply put: Liquor is quicker.
For beer, the world's most consumed alcoholic beverage, refrigeration is a big part of the emissions equation. A 2008 study by the New Belgium Brewing Company, based in Fort Collins, Colo., found that the greenhouse gas emissions from one six-pack were about the same as driving a car nearly eight miles. The largest share of those emissions came from refrigeration. Craft beers must remain chilled to retain their flavor profile, experts say.
Another factor to consider is packaging materials. Is the beer in a glass bottle or a can? In the United States, the most environmentally friendly option is almost always the can. Not only is aluminum lighter to ship, but it's more likely to be recycled.
According to Georgie Walker, co-author of a sustainability study for the Firestone Walker Brewing Company, her family's business, it's also important to look at the number of miles a beer has covered after being bottled. Then, buy local.
"It will be fresher," Ms. Walker said. "It won't be sitting in storage as long and won't have the gas miles behind it."
Shipping distance can also be an important consideration when choosing climate-friendly wine. A study by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, for example, found that transportation accounted for 13 percent of wine's emissions in the state.
Generally, shipping by sea is better than train, and train is better than truck.
An easy way to assess the emissions in play is to consider the East Coast, West Coast divide. Wines from Chile, for instance, are often transported in giant vats via ship to the West Coast, where they are bottled and then moved to market. Those wines could be a sustainable option for, say, drinkers in Oregon, but not in New Hampshire.
Easterners, on the other hand, may be better off with French Burgundies that were shipped across the Atlantic. Many wine labels list origin and bottling details.
For wine, though, there is no bigger emissions culprit than bottles.
Manufacturing a 750 milliliter glass bottle accounts for 33 percent of a wine's life cycle emissions in North America, according to the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable.
Want a better alternative? Try bag-in-box wines.
Yes, we know. Quelle horreur. But the quality of boxed wines has been improving for a while now.
According to a 2011 study of California's wine industry, boxes reduce the drink's overall carbon footprint by 40 percent. Boxed wines also last longer after being opened and the packaging is largely recyclable.
According to Dr. Kendall, the U.C. Davis professor, you can use that to help win over skeptics.
"You can feel O.K. about maybe going lower-end on your wine choices and tell your snobby friends you're saving the environment," she said.

N.F.L. Owners Send Deal to Players That Expands Season and the Playoffs

Texto completo: The proposed deal would expand the playoffs to 14 teams and extend the regular season to 17 games, among other changes.
The N.F.L.'s 32 teams moved quickly on Thursday to approve a new proposed labor agreement that includes a 17th regular-season game and an expanded playoff structure. Under the proposal, the playoffs would grow from 12 teams to 14.
Team owners, including John Mara of the Giants, the chairman of the N.F.L.'s management council, declined to comment as they exited a Manhattan hotel, where they had met for about two hours.
For the new deal to take effect, it would need to be approved by two-thirds of the 32 players' union representatives and then receive a majority vote by all players. Those union representatives will meet via conference call on Friday, and it is unknown whether they will actually vote.
The league released a statement after the meeting, acknowledging that the current collective bargaining agreement, ratified in 2011 and effective through March 2021, would continue to define operations should the players not reach an approving vote on the new proposal by next week, when the league holds its scouting combine.
Although the statement suggested that teams would not consider amending their current proposal, negotiations have been less acrimonious than they were a decade ago, when owners took a hard-line stance in trying to claw back revenue before ultimately locking out players.
"Since the clubs and players need to have a system in place and know the rules that they will operate under by next week, the membership also approved moving forward under the final year of the 2011 C.B.A. if the players decide not to approve the negotiated terms," the statement read.
Many players have been outspoken in their opposition to a 17-game regular season, including San Francisco 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman, a member of the N.F.L. Players Association executive committee. They have asserted that a 16-game season stresses their bodies enough.
"I don't think it's something that players are interested in, honestly," Sherman recently said of the 17th game. "And if that's the point they're negotiating on, I think these negotiations are going to go on a lot longer than anticipated."
On Thursday, Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette tweeted his dissatisfaction: "I disagree with the 17 games."
Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt -- who, like Sherman, is one of the most prominent voices in the game -- tweeted simply: "Hard no on that proposed CBA."
The owners are determined to resolve this impasse soon, aiming to have a new deal in place before the league year begins on March 18.
With labor peace, the league can concentrate on negotiating with television networks and technology companies for the rights to broadcast and stream games, contracts that are expected to bring in a flood of new revenue. Already, more than half of the N.F.L.'s revenue comes from the sale of broadcast rights, and the owners' insistence on adding a 17th game and expanding the playoffs is tied to goals for the bidding, given the increase in programmable content.
On Thursday, the N.F.L.P.A. president, Eric Winston, tweeted: "There has been a flood of information on the potential of a new cba. To our players: your player leadership has been working tirelessly. This is a business deal and no deal is finalized until the players vote."
The players, when they vote, will have to weigh several factors, perhaps chiefly the question of whether they will be receiving enough concessions from the owners for agreeing to an extra regular-season game.
The proposal, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, calls for the players' revenue share to increase from its current rate of about 47 percent to 48 percent or 48.5 percent if there is a 17th regular-season game. It would also provide ostensible improvements in player safety, like new limits on the demands of training camp, the introduction of a longer acclimation period in camp, better benefits, higher minimum salaries and expanded rosters.
The transformation of the N.F.L. calendar would mean a significant overhaul for a league that has not added games to the regular season since 1978 or teams to the postseason since 1990. In return for adding a 17th regular-season game, the league would eliminate a preseason game -- dropping from four to three.
The expanded playoffs would have seven teams from each 16-team conference, with only the top-seeded team in each receiving a first-round bye, a move that some argue could make the end of the season more competitive. Currently, six teams from each conference advance to the postseason, with the top two earning byes.

Texto completo: Robert Hadden's sentence upset women who said he assaulted them. Manhattan prosecutors are examining new allegations against him.
In an interview last fall, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, and his chief assistant defended their decision to strike a plea deal in 2016 that allowed a gynecologist accused of sexually abusing 19 patients to avoid going to prison.
The chief assistant, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, said the case against the doctor, Robert A. Hadden, was "not a slam-dunk." Among other things, she said, some of the women were pregnant when they say the assaults occurred and so they could not see what was happening. That, she said, could have been used by the defense to undermine them as witnesses.
But on Thursday, the district attorney's office said it had opened an investigation into new abuse allegations against Mr. Hadden.
The move came about a month after the wife of a former Democratic presidential candidate publicly declared that she was one of Mr. Hadden's victims, and amid renewed calls from elected officials and women's rights groups that Mr. Vance resign over his handling of the case.
Danny Frost, a spokesman for Mr. Vance, said in a statement that two top prosecutors had been assigned to the inquiry and that they were "in touch with a number of survivors." Mr. Frost also encouraged anyone with allegations against Mr. Hadden to contact the office.
"Their voices will be heard and the abuse they suffered will be thoroughly investigated," Mr. Frost said.
Mr. Hadden did not respond to requests for comment. The lawyer who represented him in the earlier case, Isabelle Kirshner, is not currently representing him.
Mark A. Bederow, a criminal defense lawyer in New York and former Manhattan prosecutor, said that Mr. Vance was taking an appropriate step.
"The D.A. has to do what is right," Mr. Bederow said. "And if the law permits it, they should do now what they inexplicably failed to do then: vigorously investigate and prosecute, and if the charges are proven, seek severe punishment for a serial sexual predator who abused his medical license."
Mr. Vance has been on the defensive over his prosecution of sex-crimes cases since the emergence of the #MeToo movement and the revelation that he chose not to prosecute the movie producer Harvey Weinstein in 2015 when presented with what Mr. Vance's critics said was a credible allegation.
Mr. Weinstein was later indicted on five felony counts, including rape and predatory sexual assault, and he is now on trial. The jury in the case finished its third day of deliberations on Thursday without reaching a verdict.
Criticism of Mr. Vance intensified in January when Evelyn Yang, the wife of the former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, said in an interview with CNN that Mr. Hadden had sexually assaulted her in 2012, when she was pregnant with her first child.
In an interview with The New York Times, Ms. Yang noted that she had worked with Mr. Vance's office to build a case against Mr. Hadden and had testified before the grand jury that indicted him in 2014 on charges involving six women, including five counts of committing a criminal sexual act. If the case had gone to trial, prosecutors planned to use the testimony of 13 other women who said he had abused them.
Mr. Vance's office ultimately agreed to resolve the case by letting Mr. Hadden plead guilty to a single felony count of third-degree criminal sexual contact and a misdemeanor count of forcible touching. He was stripped of his medical license but spared prison time.
Mr. Vance's office then ignored a state panel's recommendation and sought the lowest sex offender status for Mr. Hadden, which a judge granted.
In the interview last fall, Mr. Vance and Ms. Friedman Agnifilo said that the plea agreement had guaranteed that Mr. Hadden was convicted of a felony and that he could no longer practice medicine.
"It's not like we did not have a complete victory," Ms. Friedman Agnifilo said at the time. "The only thing we're talking about here is if there should have been some other punishment."
More than 65 women have now accused Mr. Hadden of sexually abusing them -- including two who were teenagers when they say the assaults occurred, said Anthony T. DiPietro, a lawyer who is representing many of the women in a lawsuit against Mr. Hadden and his employers, Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. The figure is double what it was before Ms. Yang went public with her account, he said.
Mr. DiPietro questioned Mr. Vance's motivation for starting a new inquiry, and he argued that Columbia should also be investigated for what it knew about his behavior.
"While I'm glad the D.A. finally decided to support the survivors, it's not enough," he said.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for Columbia said, "We condemn sexual misconduct in any form and will cooperate fully with any request for information from the district attorney's office related to Robert Hadden."
Marissa Hoechstetter, the first woman to publicly accuse Mr. Hadden of sexual assault, likened Mr. Vance's latest decision to how he reversed course and later prosecuted Mr. Weinstein.
"They didn't do it right the first time and now they're trying to come back and investigate him and do what they should have done the first time," she said. "It's insulting."
The earlier investigation involving Mr. Hadden began in June 2012 when a patient told the police that he had licked her vagina and touched her nipples during an examination.
One of the six women he was accused of abusing, described in court papers as Victim No. 5, said he had rubbed her clitoris after removing his gloves during an exam in 2011.
As part of the plea deal, Ms. Kirshner, who has known Mr. Vance since they were colleagues in the district attorney's office in the 1990s, negotiated with prosecutors for a pledge that they would not pursue any similar crimes that were known to the office in February 2016.
As for a new investigation into Mr. Hadden, Ms. Yang said on Thursday that she was pleased that it was happening, but continued to be frustrated over how the earlier case was handled.
"The fact that he walked away without pleading guilty to most of our crimes is very upsetting," she said. "Obviously it's the public pressure that caused all of this."

Texto completo: Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, facing increasing pressure to slow the Vermont senator's rise before Super Tuesday, criticized his record on gun control and his chances against President Trump.
LAS VEGAS -- The day after a Democratic presidential debate brought out the candidates' outrage at Michael R. Bloomberg, the focus turned back toward Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who leads polls of Nevada, California and the nation.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spent Thursday hammering Mr. Sanders for past positions that were friendly to the gun industry. Mr. Bloomberg warned that nominating Mr. Sanders would be "a fatal error." And former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said he found it hard to imagine that Mr. Sanders could defeat President Trump in a general election.
"It would be a very, very tough sell," Mr. Buttigieg told a crowd of students at a televised event at the University of Southern California. "I think it would be a tough sell with Mike Bloomberg, too. I'm saying we don't have to choose between these two options. I'm saying there is another way."
The attacks came two days before Nevada's caucuses, the third contest of the Democratic presidential nominating calendar, and the day after a bitter debate that highlighted the dire situation that Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg face. With Mr. Sanders favored to win in Nevada, they have limited time to try to stop his rise before the delegate-rich Super Tuesday contests on March 3 -- when Mr. Bloomberg and his $ 300 million advertising campaign await.
Mr. Bloomberg was in one of those Super Tuesday states, Utah, on Thursday, telling voters in Salt Lake City that Mr. Sanders could not appeal to a broad enough array of people to win the White House.
"If we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base -- like Senator Sanders -- it will be a fatal error," Mr. Bloomberg said. "We need Democrats and independents and Republicans to win."
Both explicitly and obliquely, Mr. Biden and his campaign criticized Mr. Sanders's record on gun control on Thursday, releasing a biting video of the Vermont senator saying in 2012, "I don't know that you hold a gun manufacturer responsible for what obviously a deranged person does."
In a speech at a Las Vegas community center later in the day, Mr. Biden implicitly criticized that position again, and more overtly jabbed Mr. Sanders for his past opposition to the Brady bill, which required background checks for gun purchases.
Yet after the event, a reporter asked whether Mr. Biden believed that Mr. Sanders had changed his views on guns.
"I do think he's changed his views," Mr. Biden allowed, "and I'm happy for that."
By Thursday evening, however, he was prepared to hit Mr. Sanders's record more directly.
"It's not so much what you say you believe now," he said at a CNN town hall. "It's, what did you do and when did you do it? And the fact is, Bernie has had a very different record than me for a long time."
Mr. Biden spelled it out: "He voted to exempt gun manufacturers from any liability. Zero. They can't be sued."
While Mr. Sanders's rivals sought to chip away at his popularity, he laid low on Thursday. He appeared at no public events and conducted interviews with three local TV stations in Las Vegas and Reno, his campaign said.
In a brief exchange aired on CNN from his campaign hotel in Las Vegas, Mr. Sanders criticized the wealth of Mr. Bloomberg, who is worth more than $ 60 billion.
"Mr. Bloomberg himself is worth more, one person, than the bottom 125 million Americans," he said.
The Sanders campaign was relieved on Thursday that he had emerged from Wednesday's debate unscathed, a result that it attributed to his resilience and supporters' loyalty.
"Senator Sanders's opponents have thrown everything they can at him since the launch of his campaign and they've failed to stop his campaign to build a political revolution because of his consistent, lifelong record of standing with the working class," said Mike Casca, a campaign spokesman.
The Democratic candidates' urgency to contrast themselves with Mr. Sanders came as expectations grew among rival campaigns and political operatives that he was likely to win Nevada's caucuses on Saturday.
Perhaps in an acknowledgment that they are not likely to emerge on top, Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts all plan to be out of the state when the caucus results start to be announced on Saturday afternoon.
"I think Nevada is unfathomable," said David Axelrod, the architect of Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. "Second place is anybody's guess. And second place is meaningful by the unwritten measuring sticks that the punditocracy creates. Everybody is going to be watching who finishes second."
More critical to the campaigns than Nevada are the 16 states and territories with contests on Super Tuesday. And reliable public polling data is available in just a few of those states.
In Texas, a recent University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll found Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in a dead heat. In Virginia, a Monmouth University poll released this week found Mr. Bloomberg joining Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden in a statistical tie for first place. Mr. Sanders has led recent public polls of California, the biggest Super Tuesday prize on the map.
Mr. Buttigieg exhibited unusual urgency on Thursday, sending a fund-raising appeal that for the first time issued a target he said the campaign must meet to stay afloat.
"We are the best shot at defeating Donald Trump," he wrote. "But the reality is, if we can't raise $ 13 million before Super Tuesday, we might never get that shot."
Hours before that please-help-or-we're-sunk appeal, Mr. Buttigieg's campaign released an unsigned "state of the race" memo that warned Mr. Sanders was on the verge of building a "seemingly insurmountable delegate lead."
Mr. Buttigieg, who has struggled for months to attract black and Latino voters, found himself facing a sometimes skeptical audience in Los Angeles.
Valerie Gutierrez, a junior at the University of Southern California who attended Mr. Buttigieg's event, said she was undecided but leaning toward voting for him, despite fears about his limited appeal.
"The fact that he's not able to get the diverse minority group under his coalition is a bit worrisome for me, because I'm someone from a minority background," she said.
Michael Sutter, a U.S.C. senior who said he had already voted early for Mr. Buttigieg, echoed the former mayor's warning that Mr. Sanders could not defeat Mr. Trump.
"Bernie is a little bit too far out there," he said. "He's going to scare people away."

To the Editor:
Re "Bring Back the Tomboys" (Sunday Review, Feb. 16):
While I get what Lisa Selin Davis is trying to articulate, can we finally do away with stereotypes concerning gender and sexuality?
There is nothing beneficial about calling girls who play sports or refuse to wear dresses "tomboys." They are girls who simply play what they like and wear what makes them happy. Hence, we can just call them girls!

Texto completo: Readers critique how the candidates performed at a feisty debate that one termed a "disheartening spectacle of bombast, braggadocio and rude behavior."
To the Editor:
Re "Democrats Hurl Stinging Attacks Across Debate Stage" (front page, Feb. 20):
No one "won" the debate, which must have had Republicans laughing all the way to the bank. What a disheartening spectacle of bombast, braggadocio and rude behavior. Educating voters about the issues? Hardly. Any effort to enlighten was lost as candidates stomped on one another to come out on top. I was in despair.
My pipe dream? I wish our candidates would work together to convince a landslide of voters that this president and what he represents absolutely must be defeated.
Kathryn Mikesell Hornbein

To the Editor:
What happened to civility?
As the urgency of the moment became evident, as Super Tuesday sits at the doorstep, as Michael Bloomberg and his billions threaten to change the political landscape, a war broke out on the Las Vegas stage.
Elizabeth Warren attacked seemingly everything that moved, her suddenly sinking campaign clearly deciding that being "tough" was the appropriate manner to get noticed, to breathe life into her candidacy.
Mr. Bloomberg was pummeled by all, his wealth, his stop-and-frisk policy, his nondisclosure agreements all fodder for endless very loud criticism. At times he appeared flustered, a bit befuddled and overmatched. It was not a stellar introduction to the country.
Mayor Pete and Senator Amy Klobuchar standing next to each other and going toe to toe.
Senator Bernie Sanders repeating his mantra over and over, when not denigrating the former mayor of New York City.
And Joe Biden, well, he was there trying to be as coherent and focused as possible.
It made for a more entertaining evening for certain. Whether it was actually a debate is debatable.
Robert S. Nussbaum
Fort Lee, N.J.
To the Editor:
It was refreshing to see the Democratic presidential candidates going at it with gusto on Wednesday night. Unlike the previous debates, which were often soporific and anodyne, this one was lively and afforded viewers, particularly those who are still undecided, a sharply delineated contrast among each of the candidates.
Further, it showcased a group of feisty contenders, each of whom exhibited the ability on the national stage to both land and take a punch -- critical factors for the eventual nominee to take on President Trump.
Mark Godes
Chelsea, Mass.
To the Editor:
By the time Senator Elizabeth Warren finishes dropping napalm on every one of the other Democratic presidential candidates, all President Trump will have to do in the general election is sweep up the Democratic ashes and dump them in the dustbin behind the White House.
This is what happened to Barry Goldwater in 1964, when New York Republicans like Nelson A. Rockefeller attacked Goldwater as an "extremist" crackpot. Of course, Lyndon B. Johnson won the 1964 presidential election in a landslide.
Republicans like Ronald Reagan learned a valuable lesson that became known as the 11th Commandment: "Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican."
But here we are more than 50 years later and some Democratic presidential candidates are none the wiser. The Democratic Party needs an 11th Commandment of its own, and those who choose to sin against it should be ostracized.
Clinton R. Andrews
Grosse Pointe Park, Mich.
To the Editor:
I watched the debate and Mike Bloomberg very closely. I was impressed, at times, with what I saw. I've only recently decided I would support Elizabeth Warren in the Super Tuesday primary here in Virginia. Now, I'm not so sure. Mr. Bloomberg had command. He debated well. He held his ground, even as the others punched and punched and punched. Some of those punches landed and some didn't. He was the only person on the stage I felt could remotely hold himself up against President Trump in a debate.
The debate itself was, at times, absolutely idiotic. Skewering Amy Klobuchar for forgetting (or not knowing) the Mexican president's name off the cuff. That. Does. Not. Matter. What a waste of time.
Bernie was Bernie. Biden was Biden. Warren was Warren -- thank goodness, I'd wondered where she'd gone! Klobuchar was Klobuchar. The media talking heads were the media talking heads; at times I wish they'd stop talking.
Mary E. Tyler
Williamsburg, Va.
To the Editor:
While Michael Bloomberg's Democratic opponents can accuse him of misogyny and racism, the one opponent who cannot is Donald Trump. We have only to look at Mr. Trump's history of "buying the silence of alleged mistresses," as your Feb. 20 editorial noted, and putting immigrant children in cages, separating them from their parents, to name just a few of his myriad shortcomings.
Mr. Bloomberg's negatives could not be weaponized by the president. That would free Mr. Bloomberg to use his superior intelligence and proven administrative ability and leave Mr. Trump with only his childish name-calling as an attack. "Don't vote for Bloomberg because he's shorter than I am" is not really an inspiring message.

Texto completo: The Democratic candidates are all debating a singular issue. New polls offer insights, not answers.
Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Giovanni Russonello, your morning newsletter writer taking over your afternoon edition.

At Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate, the candidates bickered and battled over health care policy; over Michael Bloomberg's record and his right to represent a party that he only recently rejoined; over the possible dangers of nominating a democratic socialist.
But in a way, it all seemed like just window dressing around one big question: Who has the best chance in November? Every policy critique seemed to lead inexorably back to this issue of electability.
In his very first comments at the debate, Mr. Bloomberg didn't just criticize Senator Bernie Sanders's plan to create a single-payer health care system -- he said it would cause Democrats to lose the general election.
"I don't think there's any chance of the senator beating President Trump," Mr. Bloomberg said. "You don't start out by saying I've got 160 million people, I'm going to take away the insurance plan that they love."
Mr. Sanders shot back, arguing that Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, was "a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
"If that's a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised," Mr. Sanders said.
A wide majority of Democratic primary voters have said in poll after poll that they care about finding someone who can win the general election more than finding a candidate who agrees with them on the issues.
But who is that candidate? It's far from clear.
Until recently, Democratic voters tended to see former Vice President Joe Biden as the strongest option. But after he failed to place in the top three in either Iowa or New Hampshire, he lost any veneer of invincibility. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday showed that for the first time in the race, Democrats are most likely to name Mr. Sanders as the candidate with the best chance to beat Mr. Trump.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's approval rating has risen, most likely lifted by the strength of the economy and his acquittal in the Senate's impeachment trial. His Gallup approval rating hit 49 percent this month -- the highest number of his presidency. So while a majority of Americans still disapprove of him, he has the potential to win at least as much support as he did in 2016, when he lost the popular vote but pulled off a decisive win in the Electoral College.
The ABC/Washington Post poll showed that in head-to-head matchups with all six of the candidates onstage at the debate, Mr. Trump would earn between 45 and 47 percent of the vote nationwide. The Democrats' shares varied from 49 to 52 percent. The differences between each Democrat were all within the poll's margin of error.
This suggests that, despite Mr. Sanders's claim that a "political revolution" would be needed to drive turnout, and in spite of his more moderate rivals' argument that his left-wing proposals would alienate a huge swath of voters, any Democratic nominee would probably have a good chance of winning the popular vote.
But Republicans have won the Electoral College three times this century, even though they have won the popular vote only once. So what really matters is who can beat Mr. Trump in a handful of key swing states.
That's why Quinnipiac University asked voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- three states that Mr. Trump narrowly flipped in 2016, giving him an Electoral College win -- to choose between the president and each of the six leading Democratic candidates.
The data from those polls suggests that Mr. Trump is in a very strong position to win Wisconsin, a heavily white state that was once solidly blue but has trended conservative over the past 10 years. None of the six leading Democratic candidates finished ahead of Mr. Trump there.
Conversely, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, he didn't have a lead against any of them. Mr. Biden beat Mr. Trump by eight percentage points in Pennsylvania -- where he was born -- and by four points in Michigan. Mr. Sanders was up by five points against the president in Michigan, and by four points in Pennsylvania. Mr. Bloomberg led Mr. Trump by six points in Pennsylvania, and by five points in Michigan.
The other three candidates included in the poll -- Senator Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth Warren -- generally fared a little less strongly, though Ms. Klobuchar had a strong, seven-point lead over Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, and none of them were behind him there or in Michigan.
A University of North Florida poll released this week found meaningful differences between the candidates' chances in that state. Mr. Bloomberg beat Mr. Trump by six points among registered Florida voters, thanks in part to the strength of his support among voters with college degrees, according to the poll. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, both hobbled by relatively weak support from black and Latino voters, each finished four points behind the president.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both ran neck-and-neck with Mr. Trump.
Like all surveys, head-to-head polls are not actually able to predict the future. They simply show what might happen if the election were held today. A lot will change over the course of the campaign.
Still, what happens in these bellwether states will determine the election -- so you can expect these kinds of head-to-head polls to be more common as the primary season rambles on, and as Democrats continue to fret over their chances to take down Mr. Trump.

From Opinion: The trickiness of electability
In this new weekly feature, our colleagues from The New York Times's Opinion section will share expert analysis and perspectives from across the political spectrum. In today's installment, there's more to read about why electability is so unpredictable.
There is a home base that all the conversation about the Democratic presidential primary comes back to in the end: Primary voters prioritize, above all, someone who can defeat President Trump.
In any election that features an incumbent president, the main goal of the out-of-power party is to nominate a candidate well-suited to defeating the incumbent. That's why both Republican Party elites and less enthusiastic conservative voters got behind Mitt Romney after a series of polls in 2011 showed he was the only Republican beating President Barack Obama in head-to-head matchups.
This year, Democrats' desire to replace the incumbent has reached a fever pitch, arguably higher than it's ever been for either party. But paradigm-shifting presidents have complicated the idea of electability, as Adam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff for Senator Harry Reid, pointed out this week in an Op-Ed.
Mr. Obama won his first election despite being a "black man who had admitted to using cocaine, who was caught on tape calling working-class whites 'bitter' people who 'cling to guns and religion,' and who sat in the pews with a pastor who declared, 'God damn America'," Mr. Jentleson said.
Mr. Romney, the Republicans' supposed safe bet, lost despite running against the sluggish economy under Mr. Obama.
And Hillary Clinton, another supposed safe bet, lost to Donald J. Trump.
So does anyone know what electability even means anymore? Our columnist Bret Stephens believes that "of course Bernie can win," but also thinks that the current front-runner's democratic socialist vision may be disqualifying for many voters: "For some of us, none-of-the-above is a viable option. For far too many others," he writes, Trump will "be the devil they know."

Texto completo: "Apeirogon," the latest novel from the National Book Award winner, delves into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the eyes of two grieving fathers.
"I'm a bit of a magpie," Colum McCann said, sheepishly gesturing around his office at Hunter College.
He has taught creative writing there for 13 years, and in that time has appointed his space with plenty of mementos: old family photographs, a self-portrait his daughter drew in neon crayon, a framed poster of what he said were among his friend Frank McCourt's last words to him. ("So, Frank, what will you confess?!!" McCann asked. "Pride springing from virtue. But not from virginity!") But the keepsake he was looking for during an interview earlier this month, which he can't believe he's lost, is a napkin.
McCann remembers what it said: "Harness the power of your grief." It was given to him by two fathers whose lives radically altered his own, and who became the central characters in his latest novel, "Apeirogon," out next week from Random House.
The book is a fictionalized account of the men, one Israeli, one Palestinian, whose daughters were killed near Jerusalem 10 years apart. Rami Elhanan, who is Israeli, lost his teenager Smadar to a suicide bombing that occurred while she was shopping with friends in 1997. Abir, the 10-year-old daughter of Bassam Aramin, who is Palestinian, was fatally shot by an Israeli soldier in 2007. An apeirogon is a shape with an infinite but countable number of sides, and over the course of the book's 1,001 chapters -- a nod to "One Thousand and One Nights" -- McCann delves into the two men's lives, sometimes writing in their voices.
Aramin and Elhanan met in 2005 through Combatants for Peace, an organization that aims to end the occupation of Palestine, and they have become close friends. They are now involved in the Parents Circle - Families Forum, an organization for Israelis and Palestinians who have lost family members in the conflict.
McCann met the men in 2015, when he first visited the region with his storytelling nonprofit, Narrative 4. He had been interested in Israel and Palestine's history since talking with George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator who helped broker peace negotiations in Ireland and the Middle East, and who appeared in McCann's continent- and century-spanning 2013 novel "TransAtlantic."
"If anything dilates my nostrils, it's the sense of some sort of difficulty," McCann said. "I knew I was completely ignorant of what was going on there, and I thought I'd like to try and explore."
[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of February. See the full list . ]
He wound up spending a week in the region. "I was sort of priding myself on the fact of being able to deal with everything -- I've seen Northern Ireland, I've done this before," said McCann, who grew up in Dublin during the Troubles. He listened to Elhanan and Aramin speak in Beit Jala, a Palestinian town, and sobbed as they told their stories.
Lisa Consiglio, a co-founder of Narrative 4 who has known McCann for years, was also there. Hearing them, she said, was a "shock to our system that had already been shocked very much." She had never seen McCann so visibly moved. "Subconsciously, I think I knew he had a book at that moment," she said.
McCann left knowing he wanted to write about the conflict. He returned several times over the next four years to conduct research and interviews for "Apeirogon."
The book has generated pre-publication interest: Steven Spielberg's company, Amblin Partners, bought the movie rights, and an Arabic version of the novel is in the works.
"Apeirogon," like other books by McCann, interweaves real people with imagined conversations, scenes and other details of their lives. McCann's National Book Award-winning novel, "Let the Great World Spin," for example, uses the high-wire artist Philippe Petit as a launching point, while another of his novels, "Dancer," imagines the life of the ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev.
But for McCann, the moral stakes of "Apeirogon" felt higher. "Nureyev can look after himself, and the memory of Nureyev can look after itself," the writer said. "With Rami and Bassam, it's so much closer to the edge, closer to the bone. If you get it wrong ... they can't necessarily recover in the same way that a really, truly, public figure could. Oh, I was terrified."
In a moment when the publishing industry is grappling with which stories are told and by whom, it is a striking choice. "We're in this territory of the real is the imagined and the imagined is real," McCann said of this project. "I think people wouldn't have trusted it as much if it wasn't real."
Elhanan's and Aramin's stories are well documented; their grief has entered public consciousness. They've been the subject of films, and have traveled the world talking about their loss and their conviction that "we can't build a state on the ruins of our kids," as Aramin said in an interview. Both have found salvation in the work, a way, Elhanan said, also in an interview, to "give meaning to my life and meaning to my loss."
Neither man hesitated when McCann approached them about his idea. They trusted him as an artist, they said, recognizing that the book, even as a work of fiction, would amplify their message.
"In our first meeting, Colum was crying like a little kid," Elhanan, 70, said. "His ability to show emotion shows that he's a really fine man with heart -- it's the basic of all basics, the ability to show emotion and to show compassion."
McCann's background also helped, Aramin, 56, said, because many Palestinians often feel a sense of solidarity with the Irish. "We have the same history of conflict."
"Apeirogon" can make for excruciating reading. McCann devotes sections to "the mushroom effect," or how the heads of suicide bombers are nearly always separated from their torsos, and the damage that rubber bullets cause. Readers are in the ambulance with Aramin and his critically injured daughter, waiting two hours and 18 minutes for traffic to clear to reach another hospital. When Elhanan remembers the sound of the rollers in the morgue, readers can imagine it, too.
McCann's fictionalization of such wrenching stories is likely to raise questions among readers, particularly in a story that unfolds in a charged political conflict where virtually every fact is up for debate. (One example: Israeli authorities initially suggested that Aramin's daughter was killed by Palestinians throwing stones; an Israeli judge later ruled in civil court that she had been shot dead by an Israeli soldier.)
"It's very difficult to talk about your pain or to read about your pain," Aramin said. Both he and Elhanan have been reading it slowly.
Yet neither father asked McCann to change anything.
"I told him from the beginning, 'It's your book, not mine,"' Elhanan said. "It's accurate, it's emotional, but I don't consider it to be my story."
He knows that it may invite criticism, he added, "but the worst already happened. I have nothing to fear."

National opioids settlement won't rival tobacco payday

Texto completo: As talks escalate to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits nationwide, a harsh reality is emerging: The money the pharmaceutical industry will pay to compensate ravaged communities will likely be far less than once envisioned.
Lawyers on all sides have been stepping up efforts to reach a national agreement before the start of a New York trial next month. But even plaintiff lawyers now believe the payout from dozens of opioid makers, distributors and retailers is likely to be less than half of what the four Big Tobacco companies agreed to pay more than 20 years ago in a landmark settlement with states over costs associated with millions of smoking-related deaths.
Whatever the final amount, it will certainly fall well short of what public health experts say is needed to heal the long-term effects of the opioid crisis.
The tobacco settlement of 1998 totaled more than $206 billion over 25 years. When pressed to name the dollar figure he was swinging for, Joe Rice, chief negotiator for thousands of cities and counties suing the pharmaceutical industry who was also instrumental in wresting the tobacco settlement, conceded in an interview: "People would say I was crazy if I thought we could get over $100 billion."
In October, the federal Council of Economic Advisers said that during the four-year period from 2015 through 2018, the economic toll from opioids was more than $2.5 trillion, including the cost of health care and law enforcement, and estimates of lost productivity.
The idea that some of the biggest U.S. corporations would not be made to cover a substantial portion of the opioid bill defies common sense to some people. But analysts and lawyers said the calculus to reach these settlements is even trickier than it was with the tobacco settlement.
For starters, four cigarette companies produced a single product - one whose dangers were undisputed. But prescription opioids are beneficial for some patients.
In addition, the dozens of companies targeted in the opioid lawsuits "do some very good things," said Rice, including making or selling an array of medicines, vitamins and medical devices as well as drugstore products like shampoo and baby lotion.
They include health and consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson; some of the world's largest makers of generic medicines; huge drug distributors McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health; and the national pharmacy chains, including Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. Opioids usually represent only a sliver of their business. Even plaintiffs' lawyers say it may not be in the public interest to squeeze the companies too tightly.
Lawyers and economists also say that pharma will most likely pay less than Big Tobacco because, by one crude measure, its damage is smaller: Prescription painkillers have claimed far fewer lives than cigarettes.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 218,000 people died of overdoses related to prescription opioids from 1999 through 2017. But each year, more than 480,000 people die of causes directly related to smoking or secondhand smoke.
So far, only two offers for a nationwide settlement have been disclosed. One offer, from Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, is valued by the company at about $10 billion, including at least $3 billion in cash from the members of the Sackler family, the owners. It has been tentatively accepted by about two dozen states and thousands of local governments but is far from final.
Another proposal, ostensibly worth $48 billion, is from the three drug distributors and two manufacturers (Teva and Johnson & Johnson), much of it to be paid over 18 years. But nearly half that figure is an in-kind assessment of the value of addiction treatment drugs and distribution services that the companies pledge to provide.

Dominated women's golf in '50s, '60s

Texto completo: Mickey Wright, one of the greatest golfers in the sport's history, with a picture-perfect swing that enabled her to dominate the women's game in the 1950s and 1960s, died Feb. 17 at a medical facility in Fort Pierce, Fla. She was 85.
The cause was a heart attack, after a recent hospitalization for a fall, said her lawyer, Sonia Pawluc.
From the late 1950s until her semiretirement in 1969, Ms. Wright was the preeminent figure in her sport, once winning 44 tournaments during a four-year span. She played infrequently after age 34, but her 82 tournament victories are the second most in women's golf history, after Kathy Whitworth's 88.
Ms. Wright was a four-time winner of both the U.S. Women's Open and the LPGA Championship, and her 13 wins in major tournaments of the Ladies Professional Golf Association are second only to Patty Berg's 15.
Experts at both Golf and Golf Digest magazines ranked Ms. Wright as the greatest female golfer of all time and among the top 10 in history, male or female.
'She was our Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods, Nancy Lopez all rolled into one,' Whitworth told Golfweek magazine.
At her peak in the 1960s, Ms. Wright was such a popular draw that sponsors refused to hold tournaments unless they knew she would appear. In 1963, she won 13 of the 32 tournaments she entered. Only one male golfer " Byron Nelson in 1945 " has won more tournaments in a single year.
But Ms. Wright's influence on the game went beyond the number of her victories. She had a swing and style of play that approached the platonic ideal of golfing perfection.
'Mickey Wright, greatest golf swing I ever saw,' Ben Hogan, a star of the 1940s and 1950s, told golf historian Rhonda Glenn in 1988. 'Boy, what a swing.'
Nelson, Tom Watson and other golfers said the same.
Using a driver with a small, wooden clubhead, Ms. Wright could routinely drive the ball 225 to 250 yards. 'I can outhit many men " much to their embarrassment,' she told Time magazine in 1963.
When reporters called her the 'female Arnold Palmer,' she angrily replied, 'Palmer and I don't have a thing in common. I have a classic swing. His is all wrong. He's just lucky he's strong as an ox.'
At first, Ms. Wright was a one-dimensional player, with an ability to drive the ball for distance but weak in what golfers call the 'short game' of chipping and putting. But as she polished her all-around game, she became almost unbeatable. In 1967, the Golf Writers Association of America named her the game's best putter " among both men and women.
She described the fundamentals of her game in a 1962 book, 'Play Golf the Wright Way,' in which she detailed the importance of the grip, foot placement, backswing, balance " and, of course, endless practice: 'You will be better if you practice and you won't be if you don't.'
The one thing she couldn't practice, however, was the pressure of competition. She finished two major tournaments " the 1962 Titleholders Championship and the 1964 U.S. Women's Open " tied for first place at the end of 72 holes. In both cases, she was tied with Ruth Jessen.
In the 18-hole playoff round for the Titleholders Championship, Ms. Wright birdied three of the first five holes and never trailed, shooting a 69 to Jessen's 72. Two years later, in the Women's Open, she won again, firing a 70 to top Jessen by two strokes in the playoff.
'At my best I would go into what I called a 'fog,' ' she told Golf Digest in 2017. 'I never thought of it as the 'zone' you hear about today, though maybe it was something like that. It was a mental state where I could concentrate really well and play with a greater confidence than usual.'
Ms. Wright was in that state in 1964, when she shot a final round of 62 at a tournament in Midland, Tex. " the lowest score in women's competition up to that point. Trailing by 10 strokes as she entered the last round, she ended up tied for the lead with her record-setting performance and then won the tournament in a sudden-death playoff.
'I don't usually emote much in public,' she told Sports Illustrated in 1964, 'but for some reason, after the first few holes, I'd grin and laugh each time I tapped a putt in. And the crowd really seemed to be with me. I've never felt so much electricity. Between shots the gallery was so quiet I could hear myself breathe.'
Mary Kathryn Wright was born Feb. 14, 1935, in San Diego. Her mother was a homemaker, her father a lawyer who introduced her to golf as a child.
She was 5-foot-8 at age 11 " 'The kids at school called me 'Moose.' I had a terrible inferiority complex' " and found solace in golf. On Saturdays, her mother drove 125 miles each way so her daughter could take lessons from Harry Pressler, a teacher Ms. Wright credited with developing her smooth swing.
'Golf is just one thing to me,'' she said in 1993. 'It is the pure pleasure of swinging the golf club.'
As a girl, Ms. Wright sometimes gave demonstrations in San Diego at night, with the course illuminated by lights. The local pro would tell her, 'Mickey, show the people how you can make the ball disappear,' she recalled to Golf Digest in 2017, 'and I would drive the ball so it went out of sight, still climbing as it passed beyond the lights. Over the years, when I needed a big drive, I'd whisper to myself, 'Make it disappear.' '
As a 19-year-old amateur in 1954, Ms. Wright was the final-round playing partner at the U.S. Women's Open with the champion, Babe Didrikson Zaharias, who had won gold medals in track at the 1932 Olympic Games before helping launch women's golf as a professional sport.
Ms. Wright left Stanford University after one year to pursue a professional golf career. As she reached her 30s, she began to battle chronic wrist and foot injuries. She stepped away from the game from time to time and won her final tournament in 1973. As late as 1979 " playing in tennis shoes because golf shoes hurt her feet " she lost in a tournament playoff to Nancy Lopez.
Ms. Wright occasionally played in senior tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s. Even when she was in her late 50s, other golfers could identify her simply by the solid sound of her club striking the ball.
'I had seen old film clips of her swing,' Hall of Fame golfer Patty Sheehan told Sports Illustrated in 2000. 'It looked the same: very fluid, very powerful " flawless. You could see she was in love with golf and dedicated to hitting a golf ball purely. She had these old clubs, old as dirt, and it was clear they were her best friends. She had an inner confidence. I picked up on that very strongly. You knew that ultimately all those wins came from something deep inside.'
Ms. Wright used the same set of Wilson clubs from 1963 until her final tournament in 1995. She donated the clubs and other artifacts to the U.S. Golf Association Museum in Liberty Corner, N.J., where she is the only woman with a dedicated room. She was also elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame and the LPGA Hall of Fame.
In later years, Ms. Wright lived alongside a golf course in Port St. Lucie, Fla. She had no immediate survivors.
She looked on modern-day golf with some disdain: She thought the longer shafts and larger clubfaces of today's clubs took much of the skill and artistry out of the game. She was particularly adept at using the 'long' irons, such as the notoriously hard-to-control 2-iron.
'I could hit it so well,' Ms. Wright told the New York Times in 2012. 'I used to say the second-greatest feeling in the world was a high 2-iron to a well-trapped green.''
There was only one feeling that was better, she said: 'Winning.'

Texto completo: President Trump has done a lot of crazy, scary things since being acquitted by the Senate on Feb. 5 " from protecting his friends in legal trouble to punishing witnesses who testified against him. But quite possibly the craziest and scariest thing he has done is to appoint Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell as acting director of national intelligence.
The 2004 law that created the Office of the Director of National Intelligence specifies that it must be headed by someone with 'extensive national security expertise.' Previous occupants of the post had decades of relevant experience in fields such as intelligence, diplomacy and the military. The least experienced was Trump's first appointee, Daniel Coats, but even he had spent a quarter-century in Congress, including three years on the Senate Intelligence Committee, followed by nearly four years as ambassador to Germany. Compared with Grenell, though, Coats looks like the second coming of Allen Dulles and 'Wild Bill' Donovan combined.
'Ric' Grenell has no intelligence background. He spent the George W. Bush administration as the spokesman for the U.S.-Mission to the United Nations, where he developed a terrible reputation among reporters. The veteran Reuters correspondent Irwin Arieff told HuffPost that Grenell was 'the most dishonest and deceptive press person I ever worked with. He often lied.' That is a big problem, given that the job of the DNI is to tell the truth " including uncomfortable truths that the president would rather not hear.
After leaving the Bush administration, Grenell became a public relations consultant, Fox News talking head and Twitter troll. In 2012, he was hired and quickly fired by Mitt Romney's presidential campaign as its foreign policy spokesman after his abusive tweets came to light, many of which denigrated women in highly personal terms. (Another factor in Grenell's dismissal was that he is openly gay, which offended the Christian right.)
Grenell became a noxious pro-Trump troll in 2015-2016. He claimed that a Gold Star father criticized Trump to enrich himself, called the Democratic convention an 'anti-police' rally and suggested that a female journalist had slept her way into her job. He badgered and harassed journalists online (including me). He was such a Trump toady that he even acquired 'Gold' level status at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.
This flackery led to Grenell's appointment as ambassador to Germany " a post he finally took up in 2018 after a Senate confirmation battle. He offended his hosts from Day One, issuing a Twitter diktat that 'German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.' Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington, told him 'never tell the host country what to do, if you want to stay out of trouble.' But Grenell continued to offend by announcing his intention to 'empower' right-wing populists throughout Europe. Grenell was widely seen as spreading Trumpism in Europe rather than representing the U.S. government. His biggest achievement was in his recent role as a special envoy to Serbia and Kosovo " he got those countries to reopen rail links.
Given Grenell's lack of intelligence qualifications, it's doubtful that even a Republican-controlled Senate would confirm him as DNI. But while Senate opposition dissuaded Trump from nominating Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) last year after Coats's departure, it won't stop Grenell from assuming the job in an 'acting' capacity even while he nominally remains ambassador to Germany.
Grenell's appointment is Trump's latest move to take complete control of any institutions that might challenge his authoritarian designs. Coats incurred Trump's wrath by issuing unvarnished intelligence assessments that confirmed that Russia had attacked the 2016 election and that Iran was in compliance with the nuclear accord. That kind of truth-telling is the last thing Trump wants.
Coats's temporary replacement, Joseph Maguire, also failed to protect Trump as he expects to be protected. The New York Times reported that Maguire's ouster came after one of his aides briefed the House Intelligence Committee last week that Russia is attempting to intervene again in the U.S. election, in an effort to reelect Trump. The Post reported that Trump erupted at Maguire over what the president views as disloyalty. Think about that: Trump regards efforts to protect the integrity of our elections as a firing offense. So now Maguire is out as DNI, and Grenell is in.
By appointing a partisan propagandist to a post that requires strict nonpartisanship, Trump is ensuring that the acting DNI in this election year will place his interests above those of the country. Given that Trump has consistently said he would accept foreign election help " indeed, he tried to blackmail Ukraine into helping him " that is a terrifying prospect for the future of our democracy. There are, mercifully, institutional checks to limit a DNI's ability to weaponize the intelligence community on behalf of the president's personal interests. With Grenell at the helm, we are likely to see those safeguards tested as never before.

Texto completo: Buzzy Linhart, a journeyman musician who became a freewheeling fixture of the 1960s and '70s music scene in Greenwich Village, where he collaborated with Bette Midler and Carly Simon, recorded with Jimi Hendrix and inspired a Youngbloods track that grew into a hippie anthem, died Feb.-13 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 76.
Mr. Linhart had long struggled with physical and mental-health issues, which contributed to a roughly decade-long stretch of homelessness in which he lived in cars or on the streets, stayed at friends' homes and found shelter after-hours inside a Los Angeles smoothie shack. He was back on his feet by the early 1990s, said his son Xeno Rasmusson, but stopped performing in 2018 after he had a heart attack and seizure.
Mainstream recognition eluded Mr. Linhart " 'I was born under an asterisk,' he once said " but he drew a cult following for his improvised jam sessions, acrobatic concerts and offbeat lyrics, which he punctuated with yells, scatting and cartoonish noises. Known mainly as a singer-songwriter, he also played piano, guitar, drums and vibraphone, sometimes leaping from instrument to instrument while performing at venues such as the Cafe Au Go Go in Manhattan.
'He would play his guitar wildly,' songwriting partner Moogy Klingman said in a 2006 documentary, 'Famous: The Buzzy Linhart Story.' 'He would sing scat for 20 minutes, play a vibes solo for 20 minutes, morph one song into another song so by the time he finished a single drum beat he would have done 10 songs to that one drum beat. There was nothing like Buzzy.'
Trained as a percussionist, Mr. Linhart began recording professionally at 16 and came to New York in 1963 to perform with singer-songwriter Fred Neil, whose song 'Everybody's Talkin' ' became a hit for Harry Nilsson. He went on to appear on dozens of records, including for Tim Hardin, Richie Havens, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Stephen Stills and John Sebastian, a onetime roommate later known as the lead singer of the Lovin' Spoonful.
In his own music, Mr. Linhart drew on rock, folk, jazz, R-B and Indian influences. His band the Seventh Sons were said to have performed the first raga (an improvised form of Indian classical music) with electric instruments, and recorded a half-hour version " 'Raga (4 a.m. at Frank's)' " for the avant-garde label ESP-Disk. Mr. Linhart spoke of searching for the moment where 'telepathy ends, and making music begins.'
He was perhaps best known for co-writing 'Friends,' also known as '(You Got to Have) Friends,' which became an unofficial theme song for Midler and appeared in two versions on her 1972 studio debut, 'The Divine Miss M.' Written with Klingman, the song was later recorded by Barry Manilow, performed on 'The Muppet Show' (with Gonzo accompanied by actress Candice Bergen) and introduced to many younger listeners by Eddie Murphy's donkey character in the animated movie 'Shrek.'
Mr. Linhart also wrote 'The Love's Still Growing,' which closed out Simon's self-titled 1971 debut and was credited with inspiring the Youngbloods' 1967 version of 'Get Together.' Written by Chet Powers, known by his stage name Dino Valenti, the song reached No. 5 on the Billboard pop chart and was in heavy rotation during the Summer of Love, opening with the lines: 'Love is but a song we sing / Fear's the way we die.'
The Youngbloods version emerged out of a Sunday afternoon session at the Cafe Au Go Go, where singer Jesse Colin Young had gone hoping that he might find rehearsal space for his band. 'I walked down the stairs and it turned out to be an open mic,' he told NPR last year. 'I thought I would turn around and go home. But Buzzy Linhart was onstage singing 'Get Together.' That song just stopped me in my tracks.'
Heading backstage, Young immediately asked Mr. Linhart to teach him 'Get Together.'
'I started singing it probably three days after I learned it from Buzzy,' Young said in 'Famous,' the documentary, 'and I haven't stopped since.'
The second of three children, William Charles Linhart was born in Pittsburgh on March-3, 1943, and raised in East Cleveland, Ohio. His father was a salesman, and both parents were musical, putting on charity shows at churches and Lions Clubs that featured Mr. Linhart and his siblings from a young age.
Mr. Linhart initially adopted the nickname Fuzzy, for the cowboy actor Fuzzy Knight. 'It quickly became Buzzy because of his energy,' his son Rasmusson said by phone. 'He was always making a sound' and took music lessons from a percussionist in the Cleveland Orchestra.
Before graduating from high school, he joined the Navy to play and compose for a military band, a stint that ended after 18 months with an honorable discharge. Mr. Linhart said that after helping put out a fire at a Washington naval base, he damaged his lungs and 'had some sort of a breakdown.'
He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and rediagnosed in recent years with post-traumatic stress disorder " which proved something of a relief, Rasmusson said, as it helped him 'understand what he was feeling' after years of mental-health struggles that contributed to his disappearance from public view. 'He was always on guard for hurt, for another round of rejection, trauma and mistreatment.'
Mr. Linhart never stopped writing music, although his recording career took a hit with a scathing reviews of his 1974 album, 'Pussycats Can Go Far.' Looking for a change, he moved to Los Angeles and did acting and musical work for film and television, playing a nude hitchhiker in the 1974 comedy 'The Groove Tube' and writing and performing in Bill Cosby's short-lived 1976 series, 'Cos.'
Two years later, a car accident pushed him into homelessness, which lasted until Hugh Romney " an entertainer and peace activist known as Wavy Gravy " helped him find a place to live in Berkeley. Mr. Linhart settled in the city and helped organize a medical marijuana co-op.
His marriages to Elizabeth Johnston and Jeanne Altson ended in divorce, and he was separated from his third wife, Kim Coleman. Survivors include a son from his first marriage, Rasmusson; a son from his second marriage, Jesse Knight; two daughters from relationships, Sara Zahn and Tiffany Rubin; a sister; a brother; and three grandchildren. Another son from his second marriage, Dylan Knight, died in 2016.
Mr. Linhart released several albums in recent years through his publishing company, Buzzart. But to some listeners, no recording could capture the energy of his live performances, which seemed to embody what New York Times music critic Robert Palmer called 'the New York speed freak style,' in which late-'60s artists filled 'every available hole in the musical fabric.'
'No sooner has he hit an opening chord than his eyes roll back in his head and he begins to bob and weave like a dervish in a trance,' Palmer wrote in 1977. 'But one once endured such overachieving regularly in the interests of hearing genuine talent, and Mr. Linhart's talent is genuine.'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Election intelligence officials warned lawmakers that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign with a goal of getting President Donald Trump re-elected, according to several media reports.
First reported by the New York Times, the February 13 briefing led to Trump reprimanding Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, and accused him of being disloyal after aide Shelby Pierson told lawmakers aggressive Russian actors were continuing election-intrusion from 2016.
OnPolitics: Are you looking for politics news? Same.
Trump was reportedly especially displeased that House Intelligence Chairman, Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , was included in the briefing, for fear that the congressman would try to use it to undermine the president during his re-election, according to the New York Times.
Schiff led the impeachment proceedings against Trump.
Pierson addressed Russia's overall efforts, including weaponizing social media, hacking, and diminishing election infrastructures, according to reports. She was not well perceived by House lawmakers who are loyal to Trump, according to CNN.
Maguire is now set to step down as acting DNI. Trump announced this week that he would be replaced by Richard Grenell, who as ambassador to Germany has been among the most outspoken supporters of the president within the U. S. diplomatic corps.
Trump said he will name Grenell as his acting intel chief, a key job that has been without a permanent, Senate-confirmed appointee for six months.
Russia interfered in the 2016 election in an attempt to boost Trump to victory. The interference led to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
More: Intelligence employee pleads guilty to leaking classified info to journalists
Mueller told lawmakers after the two-year investigation that the Russian government had sought to meddle in the 2016 election in a dramatic fashion, and that it did so with an eye toward benefiting Trump. He said Trump's campaign welcomed, even praised, that assistance, and while he said investigators did not gather sufficient evidence to prove a conspiracy, "problematic is an understatement" to describe some of Trump's conduct.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted, "Republicans keep blocking election security bills in the Senate, and now we know why: They’d rather let Putin win than stand up to President Trump. "
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the Democratic nomination, said that "Trump is shredding the rule of law—and the integrity of our democracy. "

Trump Berated Intelligence Chief Over Report Russia Wants Him Re-Elected; President chastised official after staffer informed bipartisan House panel that Moscow might again seek to boost his campaign

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump lashed out at his acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, earlier this month after learning that one of his subordinates had briefed the House Intelligence Committee about Russia's apparent preference for Mr. Trump in the 2020 presidential contest, people familiar with the matter said.
The Oval Office confrontation occurred after Mr. Trump learned that Shelby Pierson, the top election-security official in Mr. Maguire's office, delivered information on election interference in a classified hearing before bipartisan members of the House panel, alongside national security officials from other federal agencies, three of the people said.
During that hearing, Ms. Pierson said Russia appeared to favor Mr. Trump over Democratic challengers and might seek to act on that preference, two of the people said, in a move that would reprise Moscow's efforts during the 2016 election to boost his candidacy .
Mr. Trump grew irate after learning that the classified hearing, which took place on Feb. 13 and was attended by both Democrats and Republicans, occurred before his own meeting on election interference, which occurred the next day, those people said. The president also expressed his agitation over the substance of what Ms. Pierson told lawmakers about Russia's possible interest in interfering on his behalf, these people said, with one person describing it as a prolonged and pointed interrogation of Mr. Maguire. Officials from other agencies were also present in the room, these people said.
Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he was replacing Mr. Maguire , a retired Navy vice admiral, as acting director of national intelligence with Richard Grenell, the current ambassador to Germany. Mr. Grenell has scant experience with intelligence matters and is viewed by Democrats as an ardent loyalist to the president. Mr. Maguire had been rumored to be in the running to be nominated to the position full-time, and Mr. Trump had praised him publicly during his tenure.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump told reporters that among the candidates he is considering to serve as permanent director of national intelligence is Rep. Doug Collins, a conservative congressman and staunch defender of the president who is running against Sen. Kelly Loeffler to be the GOP candidate for a Georgia U.S. Senate seat. But Mr. Collins rejected the potential offer Friday morning, saying on Fox Business it was "not a job that interests me at this time—it's not one that I would accept."
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who led the House's impeachment case against the president in the Senate. The Republican-controlled Senate earlier this month acquitted Mr. Trump of both charges passed by the Democratic House, obstruction of Congress and abuse of power related to his efforts to press Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in his re-election campaign. Mr. Trump mentioned Mr. Schiff during the Oval Office meeting as a reason he was irritated lawmakers were briefed first, one of the people familiar with the meeting said.
One of the people familiar with the matter said Mr. Maguire was unlikely to be tapped for the permanent director of national intelligence position regardless of the Oval Office clash last week.
The White House had been discussing nominees for the job even before Maguire's ouster and will make an announcement on or before the March 11 deadline, according to a White House official.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the House Intelligence Committee declined to comment. The White House didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Trump's rebuke of Mr. Maguire was first reported by the Washington Post.
In both public and private, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his skepticism at the conclusions reached by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 contest and did so to help him win, viewing that as part of plot by Democrats and career bureaucrats to diminish his victory and undermine his presidency. The continuing refusal to accept that consensus view played a part in his impeachment by the House, as Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian president in a July phone call to investigate the Biden family as well as a debunked theory that a Democratic computer server that could show Russia was framed for the election interference had been secretly whisked away to Ukraine.
Moscow interfered in "sweeping and systemic fashion" in the 2016 election in an effort to boost then-candidate Trump's chances by spreading divisive social media content and hacking and leaking Democratic emails, according to the findings of former special counsel Robert Mueller. Russia has denied election interference.
Ms. Pierson was tapped to lead the Office of Director of National Intelligence's newly formed election threats group last summer. Dan Coats, the previous intelligence chief, installed her as one of his last acts before leaving his position in part to ensure the office continued to address the Russian threat to U.S. elections seriously, according to people familiar with the matter.
In her role, Ms. Pierson would have access to classified intelligence flowing from multiple government agencies, such as the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, about election interference activity from Russia and other foreign actors.
But she has a reputation for being injudicious with her words and not appreciating the delicate work of corralling federal agencies, technology firms and state election officials to collaborate on election security, people familiar with her work have said.
A spokeswoman for Ms. Pierson didn't respond to a request for comment.
Last September, Ms. Pierson upset representatives from several technology companies during a meeting at Facebook Inc.'s headquarters when she accused them of not sharing enough data about their users with the government , the Journal previously reported.

Joe Wood, a promising literary career cut short

Texto completo: Two things occurred recently to remind me of the author and editor Joe Wood: first there is all the fresh discussion around the life and times of Malcolm X, mainly generated by the documentary being aired on Netflix; the other was an extensive article on climate change in last weeks New York Times by Somini Sengupta.
The two of them, no longer a couple, had been attending a Unity '99 Conference in Seattle when Joe set out on a birdwatching trek that July in 1999 and was never heard from again. Apparently he had succumbed to unexpected weather and terrain, or fell into a ravine. It was reported that the 34-year-old writer had a heart condition in which he was considering acquiring a pacemaker.
Whatever the circumstances that deprived us of Joe's promising literary career-he was working as an editor at The New Press-he left a legacy of significant journalism and several books.
There are snippets of Joe's life and early years coming of age in the Bronx, particularly his conflicted and often turbulent days as a student at Riverdale High School. "I remember not wanting friends from school visiting my side of the Bronx," Joe wrote. He remarked on the race and class differences between where he lived and where he went to school. "In school, I had white friends and learned to like their music and talk like them. Back at home my friends accused me of slowly turning white, and then we had a big fight, and then we lost our friendship."
Lee Smith of the Washington Examiner provides a poignant bridge when he wrote: "Joe was a kid from the Bronx who wound up going to a private school in the borough, Riverdale, before he went on to Yale. I think he was so accustomed to being the only African American in any given room that he was keen to get that fact out of the way. He did not make it easy. He always opened a conversation with a stranger about race. He had edited a collection of essays on Malcolm X. He was writing a book about the slave-owning family that owned his family. Did you see the latest Spike Lee movie? What do you think about Public Enemy's last album? Joe had a very acute sense of power, and if he felt his interlocutor flinch, he'd tear him to ribbons. But I can't count the number of times at a party I turned around again after a few minutes and saw Joe and his new best friend bright in tire light of Joe's warm laugh. But the deeper truth is that he wasn't interested just in race or writing about race-he was a movie fanatic at a time when memorizing classic European films entailed hours, days, and weeks in dark theaters across New York. Race, though, was liis way into the human experience-it was his experience, and thus part of his way of explaining himself, to others and to himself."
This image of Joe reflects a bit of the few conversations 1 had with him, and we had so much in common politically, intellectually, so much so that we had promised to collaborate on a project about Black thinkers and the at that time tense ideological situation. To some extent Joe had already dipped deeply into the current of these ideas, some of which was manifested in his articles and essays in various publications. Some of this territory was even forged in his books, particularly in "Ugly Water" and "Funnymen: Life and Times on the Greatest Show on Earth." I recall another writer and his impression of Joe. Adam Shatz said that Joe had "a voice as deep as a double bass, and he spoke as he wrote: low, slowly, softly. He forced you to listen attentively to each of his words, pausing gravely as if to prepare you for the next one.
"When I first met Joe," Shatz added, "I thought this was an affectation. Before long, however, I realized it was a style, the outward mark of sensibility, artful but true. And with tliis style, Joe had a look, one that gave him away instantly." He had big, bookish glasses, Shatz continued, "The Malcolm X cap, worn with urbane nonchalance. The knapsack filled to capacity with literature. The bemused, vaguely world-weary expression that sometimes broke into a wide, astonished smile."
That smile could morph into a loud laugh or make a sudden turn to deep inquiry, pushing the encounter to a new level of discussion about something serious that he was seeking answers to, or probing how you felt about something that was troubling him.
The final words belong to Faith Childs, Joe's literary agent. She was part of a coterie of friends and loved ones who missed the intrepid Joe, the Eagle Scout, and was seeking to find him and to bring closure. They even hired a NYPD detective to retrace Joe's last stops. "We wanted someone who knows the wicked ways of the world," she said. And of the search, "I can't say uncle yet. I just can't."
Sidebar "...he was a movie fanatic at a time when memorizing classic European films entailed hours, days, and weeks in dark theaters across New York. Race, though, was his way into the human experience-it was his experience, and thus part of his way of explaining himself, to others and to himself."

Trump's travel ban ignores the Nigerian success story

Texto completo: On a Sunday evening at Eko Kitchen, San Francisco's first and only Nigerian restaurant, the menu for the evening combines sweet, earthy, zesty and piquant: plantain pancakes with Nigerian eggs, Akara - black eyed peas fritter served with Ogi - fermented corn pudding, honey glazed Suya wings, and Puff Puff - Nigerian donut holes.
"When people find out I'm from Nigeria, the first thing they ask is about Boko Haram or the Nigerian Prince scam," said Simileoluwa Adebajo, the 24-year-old owner of the restaurant. It is such an "annoying narrative and Nigeria is so much more than that."
So, Adebajo has made it her mission to teach Nigerian culture "through the universal language of food." Everyone has to eat, she remarked and in May of last year she opened Eko Kitchen in SoMa.
Adebajo left Nigeria to come to America in 2016, when she turned 21, to enroll in the University of San Francisco for a master's in international economics. She went on to work as a financial analyst at Twitch after she graduated.
Then one day last year, she made a bold career move, tweeting her plans on April 5: "So I've quit my job as a financial Analyst to open the first #Nigerian restaurant in the city of San Francisco. Tbh I'm not sure of exactly what I'm doing but I'll do my best with what I have. Wish me luck, guys." Over 55,000 people responded to her tweet, affirming that San Francisco believed in this bright, articulate, ambitious young woman who was ready to create opportunities for herself.
But Trump's administration has decided they don't want to offer people from Nigeria the chance to succeed in America anymore. In yet another version of the travel ban, first issued on Jan. 27, 2017, Nigerians, Eritreans, Burmese, Kyrgyz, Sudanese and Tanzanians join a list of people from seven other countries with limited entry to America.
The new order, issued on Jan. 31, prevents permanent legal immigration from these countries and Tanzania and Sudan will no longer have access to diversity visas. But rather peculiarly, belying the dubbed title of "travel ban," people from these countries will still be able to enter America on business, tourist or other non-immigrant visas.
All the new countries on the list have significant Muslim populations and Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan and Tanzania together constitute roughly a quarter of all Africans.
"It's infuriating!" Adebajo exclaimed. Either he just doesn't know or he's not being advised properly, she added, referring to the President and the travel ban.
According to the White House, the reasons for including Nigeria is that the country "does not adequately share public-safety and terrorism-related information" and "Nigeria also presents a high risk, relative to other countries in the world, of terrorist travel to the United States."
But as the Cato Institute found, the annual chance of an act of murder on U.S. soil committed by a foreign born terrorist from Nigeria and the other five countries on the new travel ban "is about 1 in 1.9 billion per year."
Further, if it's security that the administration is worried about, then why allow Nigerian nationals into the country on tourist and temporary visas?
And when it comes to the sharing of information, as New American Economy (NAE) points out, other nations "do not cooperate with the United States on security or terrorism-related matters, but they have not been singled out."
Nigerians have a history of success in America, as Adebajo so clearly exemplifies. Nigerian Americans have the highest level of education in the nation, with the Houston Chronicle reporting that 21 percent of Nigerians nationwide hold graduate degrees and 37 percent have bachelor's degrees.
In contrast, just over 11 percent of all Americans hold graduate degrees and only 21 percent have completed a bachelor's degree.
All this goes to show that the Nigerian community in America is well-educated, well-earning, and significant contributors to the economy. NAE reports that in 2018, more than 375,000 Nigerians came to America earning "almost $14.3 billion and paying more than $2.7 billion in federal income taxes and $1.4 billion in state and local taxes in 2018 alone."
Since President Trump took office, America's record on immigration has been a miasma of misinformation, confusion and incoherence. Let's recall an incident in 2017, when the New York Times reported that at a meeting with his national security team, President Trump, enraged after reading a report on the number of visas given to immigrants that year, applied his now legendary skill at coming up with insulting names and titles for people and places. It was alleged that he called Afghanistan a terrorist haven; dismissed Haitians by saying "they all have AIDS;" and described Nigerians as never wanting to "go back to their huts in Africa" after seeing America.
What the President failed to understand is that having Nigerians leave America would not benefit America. For instance, the health care industry would take a beating if such a thing were to happen, especially given America's aging crisis. In 2018, over 60,000 Nigerians worked as registered nurses, nursing assistants, personal care aides, vocational nurses and physicians, according to NAE.
Passionately denouncing the travel ban, Adebajo averred that it is based on discrimination. There's no other justification, "Nigeria is the most populous black nation, so add that to the equation," she remarked.
She might be right.
Indeed, we want people like Adebajo to be a part of our multicultural fabric in The City. In a show of support, do make a reservation at her restaurant and try some Nigerian food and contribute to her Kickstarter campaign to help Adebajo grow her business and increase her capacity to serve delectable Nigerian cuisine and culture.

African American Opera Star Snags Lead in 'Samson &amp; Delilah' at Kennedy Center

Texto completo: From the basketball court to the opera stage, J'Nai Bridges is bringing her vibrant voice to the Kennedy Center.
Bridges, a rising star whose parents and family live in Baltimore, will have a lead role in the seduction-and-deceit tangle that is Saint-Saēns's sensual grand opera "Samson & Delilah," which debuts on March 1 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.
The rising star, who once appeared destined for a career in pro basketball, counts among the few African Americans who have excelled in the opera. She previously sang the titular role in "Carmen" at the San Francisco Opera and has earned features in The New York Times Style magazine, Flaunt magazine and several others.
Bridges also once performed for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in Washington.
"I grew up playing basketball because I have a great passion for sports," Bridges said. "But I also grew up singing in the church choir, and I've played piano since I was about 5. Music was always in my bones, but so was basketball."
While in high school in Lakewood, Washington, Bridges appeared in her first opera. One of her rehearsals for the opera coincided with a basketball tournament Bridges' high school team played.
"I asked my coaches if I could go to the rehearsal and then have my mother drive me to the game rather than me attending the team meeting beforehand," Bridges said. "The coach agreed, but then when I got the game after rehearsal, he didn't allow me to warm up and kept me on the bench. He said I let my team down and that I didn't show great sportsmanship because I choose the opera over my team. He told me that I had to make a choice finally. That was the last day that I played."
That shrewd decision couldn't have turned out any better for the rising star. According to her biography, Bridges' operatic engagements in the U.S. this season include her debut at The Metropolitan Opera. It also includes singing the role of Nefertiti in Philip Glass' opera "Akhnaten" and her house and role debut at Washington National Opera performing as Dalila in "Samson et Dalila."
Additionally, Bridges will sing the titular role of "Carmen" for the first time in Europe at the Dutch National Opera and will make her debut with the Festival d'Aix-enProvence singing Margret in a new production of Wozzeck, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.
Her season also includes a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, a concert repertoire with the San Antonio Symphony in Mahler's Symphony No. 2, and debuting with the New Jersey Symphony in Handel's "Messiah."
For an opera singer, it's a fantastic schedule. For an African American, it's more operatic history.
"The opera definitely has been changing, and it continues to change, which is really necessary and refreshing," Bridges said. "The National Opera has done an excellent job of inclusivity, and they continue to work diligently at it. I've spoken to people on staff, and they make it a point not only to hire Black people but to ask how we feel and to ask what might need improvement. So, not only are we on the stage, but we are behind the scenes, too."
Sampson & Delilah opens March 1 and runs through March 21 at the Kennedy Center. For tickets and information, go to kennedy-center.org. WI

Santa Fe mayor backs Bloomberg

Texto completo: Calling him the only candidate who can defeat Republican President Donald Trump in November, Mayor Alan Webber is among a nationwide network of politicians endorsing billionaire Michael Bloomberg in the Democratic primary."His record of accomplishment is unmatched," Webber said in his endorsement, which is featured on Bloomberg's campaign website along with the endorsements of dozens of other current and former mayors from across the country who are part of Bloomberg's "Mayor's for Mike" coalition.
Webber's endorsement, which has generated stinging criticism online from other local Democrats, comes on the heels of a report in the New York Times about Bloomberg tapping into a huge network of elected officials "whom he has funded as a philanthropist or advised as an elder statesman of municipal politics" as he seeks the presidential nomination.
In an interview Wednesday, Webber said there are a lot of Democratic candidates who are "very strong and very talented." But he said he views the presidential race as a "one-issue election."
"The issue is who can beat Donald Trump, and for me, [former New York City Mayor] Bloomberg has the greatest capacity to attract the disaffected Republicans, the independent voters, as well as the traditional Democratic base to win in November," Webber said.
"It'll be a very close election if things hold true," he added. "A lot of it will boil down to who can attract crossover voters, independent voters. My assessment is Mayor Bloomberg has the greatest chance of winning."
Vince Kadlubek, the former CEO of Meow Wolf, disagrees and criticized Webber for throwing all his support behind Bloomberg. Though he was initially a supporter of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Kadlubek said it has become clear that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has the "most plausible path toward the nomination and toward defeating Trump."
"It's disheartening to see an endorsement of a candidate who is attempting to buy the nomination and in my opinion doesn't represent the ideals and characteristics of the Democratic Party," he said in an interview Wednesday.
"To hear our mayor at this point say that Bernie doesn't have a chance to beat Trump is ... contributing to a fabricated narrative that is alienating a large percentage of the Democratic base," said Kadlubek, who called Bloomberg "a mostly Republican billionaire with a racist and sexist past."
Bloomberg has been highly criticized for the "stop-and-frisk" police policy practiced during his tenure as mayor. The policy, which was deemed unconstitutional, disproportionately targeted black and Hispanic men. Bloomberg also has been accused by women of making lewd and sexist comments.
Asked how he reconciled supporting a candidate accused of being racist and sexist, Webber deflected.
"He has to answer that question," Webber said. "If he comes up with an answer that people find acceptable, he'll get the nomination, and if he doesn't, he won't. I'm looking at the end game, which is what happens in November."
Estelle Berger, chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Santa Fe County, said elected officials are welcome to endorse the candidates they prefer.
"Both the Democratic Party of New Mexico and our county party are focused on engaging voters around our county and state in order to elect Democrats in 2020," she wrote in an email. "As the chair of the Democratic Party of Santa Fe County, I remain neutral in contested primaries and look forward to supporting our eventual nominees."
Bloomberg, who has spent more than $400 million of his own money on TV advertising and other campaigning efforts, qualified for Wednesday's Nevada debate after surging in the polls despite jumping into the race only a little over three months ago.
Bloomberg "has been spending not hundreds of millions of dollars over months but billions of dollars over years to build a political and philanthropic empire for himself and a national profile and network of influence that we are now seeing applied in so many ways in this race," Alexander Burns, a national political correspondent at the New York Times, said in the newspaper's podcast, The Daily.
That network of influence extends to the city of Santa Fe and Webber.
In 2017, Bloomberg, who is one of the world's richest people, poured nearly $1.5 million into a failed and highly divisive proposal by former Mayor Javier Gonzales to tax sugary drinks in Santa Fe. His in-kind and cash contributions allowed a political committee working in support of the measure to financially stand toe-to-toe with tax opponents. Bloomberg had previously spent more than $18 million supporting similar measures in the Bay Area cities of San Francisco and Oakland, Calif. But unlike Santa Fe's proposal, those measures passed.
In 2018, the year Webber took office, he was selected to attend the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative, described as a yearlong education and professional development program designed exclusively for mayors. The New York Times called it a "prestigious boot camp ... that gives the mayors access to ongoing strategic advice from Bloomberg-funded experts."
Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller participated in the leadership initiative the same year as Webber. Unlike Webber, though, Keller turned down a request to endorse Bloomberg - or any other candidate for that matter.
"Keller is the mayor of a major city, so campaigns have reached out," said Matt Ross, a spokesman for Keller. "But he's decided to stay focused on Albuquerque and solving our biggest challenges."
Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima took a different approach and also endorsed Bloomberg. In fact, Miyagishima is featured prominently on Bloomberg's campaign website.
"I like Mike because we get two for one with Mike Bloomberg," the Las Cruces mayor says in a YouTube video posted on Bloomberg's "Mayor's for Mike" page on his campaign website.
"One, he's run an ultra-successful business, and two, he's run a huge corporation called the city of New York - both in a successful manner," Miyagishima says in the video. "You put those two together - wow - the United States will take off."
While Webber said his participation in Bloomberg's leadership initiative may have "in a sense" influenced his decision to endorse Bloomberg after interacting with him there, as well as at the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Webber said winning back the White House is the driving factor.
"The overarching issue is to change the occupant of the White House," Webber said. "Everybody is entitled to their own opinion. My opinion based on the assessment of the electorate and the mood of the public is that Mayor Bloomberg's got the best chance to win. If the nominee is somebody else, whoever it is, will have my complete support."

Texto completo: The Puritan Backroom in Manchester, N.H., has long been a favorite of locals and visiting politicians — and now it has national acclaim in the food world, too, with a James Beard Foundation America's Classics Award. The award is bestowed upon locally owned restaurants that showcase excellent food and reflect the character of a community. The James Beard Awards are considered the Oscars of the food world, with categories that honor the best chefs, restaurants, and hospitality professionals across the country every year.
The restaurant began as the Puritan Confectionary Company in 1917, opened by Grecian immigrants Arthur Pappas and Louis Canotas. Their kids continued the culinary tradition, launching Puritan Backroom in 1974. Along with Greek-American comfort food and ice cream, the business has expanded to include an event and conference center. US Representative Chris Pappas co-owns the spot, and it's now a popular stopover for campaigners, including Joe Biden earlier this month. Locals love the chicken tenders, a Backroom signature, and mudslides.
Puritan Backroom will be feted at the annual James Beard Awards gala on Monday, May 4, in Chicago.

Texto completo: Some attorneys say it can be the only way for people to defend themselves. Advocates say it falls woefully short.
In a #MeToo world, is written and recorded sexual consent the new norm?
Two former Ohio State University football players, Amir I. Riep, 21, and Jahsen L. Wint, 21, were arrested last week after being accused of raping and kidnapping a 19-year-old woman. Coach Ryan Day dismissed the two from the team.
Columbus police say Riep told the victim to say the encounter was consensual on a video recording.
The idea of seeking "proof" of consent is concerning to sexual violence researchers and prevention advocates for a number a number of reasons. But some criminal defense attorneys say they encourage seeking consent in some sort of documented form, in writing, or an audio or video recording.
Columbus criminal defense attorney Brad Koffel advises his clients to obtain some sort of written consent for sexual acts, even if it's just a text message, and added that any sort of audio or video recording indicating consent is good, too.
"I think the best practice for young men is to ask for consent in writing," he said. "And if they don't, in this climate, then they're going to suffer some consequences."
Earlier this month, an attorney for Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who is standing trial for rape and sexual assault, made similar suggestions.
"If I was a man in today's world, before I was engaging in sexual behavior with any woman today, I would ask them to sign a consent form," Weinstein's attorney, Donna Rotunno, said on The Daily, a New York Times podcast.
Although some attorneys view documented consent as a form of protection, Columbus criminal defense attorney Dan Sabol said he would feel concerned if a client obtained written or recorded consent from a sexual partner.
"That'd be a red flag," he said. "It might look as though they're trying to cover their tracks."
Proof of consent might help someone who is falsely accused, he said. But if there is compelling evidence that a sexual act was not consensual, the documentation of consent from a partner could make a suspect appear even more guilty.
"Just because someone says it's consensual on video doesn't make it so," he said.
Brandon Shroy, Columbus criminal defense attorney, said a jury is ultimately responsible for determining the validity of a consent video.
"It's something that defense attorneys — someone who are defending them — would love to see, but it's something a group of jurors would choose to believe or disbelieve," he said.
Sexual assault prevention advocates said they are seeing more instances of young people being advised to get "proof" of consent, but warn that formal documentation in writing or video doesn't capture how consent really works.
"It should be taken as a red flag that a person would have enough doubts about whether or not consent was established to...request this type of agreement before or after an encounter," said Laura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. "Because in reality, one of the most important things for people to know about consent is that if you have any doubts, or not sure that you're on the same page with your partner, then the interaction should not move forward with your partner."
Emily Gemar, campus advocacy coordinator for OhioHealth's Sexual Assault Response Network of Central Ohio, said consent can legally be revoked at any time, so written or recorded documentation of consent is in no way representative of an entire sexual encounter.
"If someone consents on a recording one time, it doesn't simply (mean) blanket consent for everything after that," she said.
Experts said such recommendations for consent videos or texts isn't surprising, given the current climate and attention on sexual assaults.
"With the #MeToo Movement and a lot of people in powerful positions having harmed many survivors, I'm sure that there is a move to protect themselves by trying to record consent somehow," Gemar said.
" ... On the one hand, people know that consent is important, but on the other hand, of course, these types of ways of proving consent are concerning," said Zoë Peterson, director of the Sexual Assault Research Initiative at Indiana University's Kinsey Institute, who studies sexual consent, sexual assault, sexual coercion and unwanted sex.
Gemar said she uses the 'FRIES' model to outline the requirements of consent: freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, specific.
"A good consensual act or series of events should be active communication the whole time and checking in with their partner," she said. "They should consent and enthusiastically agree the whole time."
Consent can "only exist when there's equal power and there's no pressure" between two people, Gemar said, and obtaining documented consent from a partner may limit the power of a partner to communicate his or her wants and needs during a sexual act.
"Consent is a free choice," she said. "It needs to be something that is explicit and ongoing."
But Koffel said documenting consent can be the only defense for a person if falsely accused of sexual assault.
"The only way that young men have to defend themselves after the fact of what they thought was a consensual sexual act is to obtain some consent in writing before the fact, even if it is in a text," he said. "Otherwise, they are stuck with their accuser's version of events."
The Sexual Assault Response Network of Central Ohio has a 24/7 hotline for victims of sexual assault at 614-267-7020. Ohio State students, faculty and staff can call 614-688-2518 for on-campus support. More information is available at ohiohealth.com/sarnco.

Consent can "only exist when there's equal power and there's no pressure" between two people, Gemar said, and obtaining documented consent from a partner may limit the power of a partner to communicate his or her wants and needs during a sexual act.
"Consent is a free choice," she said. "It needs to be something that is explicit and ongoing."
But Koffel said documenting consent can be the only defense for a person if falsely accused of sexual assault.
"The only way that young men have to defend themselves after the fact of what they thought was a consensual sexual act is to obtain some consent in writing before the fact, even if it is in a text," he said. "Otherwise, they are stuck with their accuser's version of events."
That approach, though, can perpetuate "victim-blaming myths," said Palumbo.
"They're reiterating this idea that people who report and come forward of having been sexually assaulted are falsely reporting," she said. "(But) what we know from the research is false reports of sexual assaults are very rare. Sexual assault is the most underreported violent crime."
The Sexual Assault Response Network of Central Ohio has a 24/7 hotline for victims of sexual assault at 614-267-7020. Ohio State students, faculty and staff can call 614-688-2518 for on-campus support. More information is available at ohiohealth.com/sarnco.

Texto completo: Some attorneys say it can be the only way for people to defend themselves. Advocates say it falls woefully short.
In a #MeToo world, is written and recorded sexual consent the new norm?
Two former Ohio State University football players, Amir I. Riep, 21, and Jahsen L. Wint, 21, were arrested last week after being accused of raping and kidnapping a 19-year-old woman. Coach Ryan Day dismissed the two from the team.
Columbus police say Riep told the victim to say the encounter was consensual on a video recording.
The idea of seeking "proof" of consent is concerning to sexual violence researchers and prevention advocates for a number a number of reasons. But some criminal defense attorneys say they encourage seeking consent in some sort of documented form, in writing, or an audio or video recording.
Columbus criminal defense attorney Brad Koffel advises his clients to obtain some sort of written consent for sexual acts, even if it's just a text message, and added that any sort of audio or video recording indicating consent is good, too.
"I think the best practice for young men is to ask for consent in writing," he said. "And if they don't, in this climate, then they're going to suffer some consequences."
Earlier this month, an attorney for Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who is standing trial for rape and sexual assault, made similar suggestions.
"If I was a man in today's world, before I was engaging in sexual behavior with any woman today, I would ask them to sign a consent form," Weinstein's attorney, Donna Rotunno, said on The Daily, a New York Times podcast.
Although some attorneys view documented consent as a form of protection, Columbus criminal defense attorney Dan Sabol said he would feel concerned if a client obtained written or recorded consent from a sexual partner.
"That'd be a red flag," he said. "It might look as though they're trying to cover their tracks."
Proof of consent might help someone who is falsely accused, he said. But if there is compelling evidence that a sexual act was not consensual, the documentation of consent from a partner could make a suspect appear even more guilty.
"Just because someone says it's consensual on video doesn't make it so," he said.
Brandon Shroy, Columbus criminal defense attorney, said a jury is ultimately responsible for determining the validity of a consent video.
"It's something that defense attorneys — someone who are defending them — would love to see, but it's something a group of jurors would choose to believe or disbelieve," he said.
Sexual assault prevention advocates said they are seeing more instances of young people being advised to get "proof" of consent, but warn that formal documentation in writing or video doesn't capture how consent really works.
"It should be taken as a red flag that a person would have enough doubts about whether or not consent was established to...request this type of agreement before or after an encounter," said Laura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. "Because in reality, one of the most important things for people to know about consent is that if you have any doubts, or not sure that you're on the same page with your partner, then the interaction should not move forward with your partner."
Emily Gemar, campus advocacy coordinator for OhioHealth's Sexual Assault Response Network of Central Ohio, said consent can legally be revoked at any time, so written or recorded documentation of consent is in no way representative of an entire sexual encounter.
"If someone consents on a recording one time, it doesn't simply (mean) blanket consent for everything after that," she said.

Gloria Steinem on the ERA, #MeToo and hope

Texto completo: By 4 p.m. Wednesday, people were already lining up at the doors to the Carlson Family Stage at Northrop for a program that wouldn’t start until 6 p.m. They were there to hear Gloria Steinem, this year’s Distinguished Carlson Lecturer, in conversation with MPR’s Kerri Miller.
Arguably the world’s most famous feminist – she has also been called the “mother of feminism,” which must tickle or annoy her, since she has no children and never wanted any – Steinem has spent most of her life fighting for women’s rights. Now 85, she’s still traveling, speaking, listening, keeping up with politics and news, making waves.
At the lecture, the University of Minnesota’s new president, Joan T.A. Gabel, began her opening remarks with, “How great is this? Can we just say that?” The U’s first woman president confessed to sneaking her mother’s Ms. magazines. After calling Steinem “one of the foremost advocates of our time, a leader and a trailblazer,” Gabel noted that “a life of purpose and service to others makes the world better and fairer and more just, but it also changes trajectories for generations of people … and women like me.”
Earlier, we met with Steinem in her dressing room at Northrop, trying not to think about the fact that this elegant woman in a red blazer and leather pants was the Gloria Steinem. This interview has been edited and condensed.
MinnPost: You’ve been fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment for almost 50 years. What do you think the chances are that it will pass?
Gloria Steinem: When we first took it up – of course, it was left over from the first wave [of feminism, the suffragists] – we thought, “How hard can this be?” The public opinion polls showed that the vast majority of people supported it. And then it got up to the last three states and it became very, very difficult.
It took us a long time to figure out that the problem was the insurance companies. They would have to revise the actuarial tables, which would cost them a lot of money. I’m not sure myself the degree to which that is still the problem.
Today there are so many questions, political questions, that I don’t know if we can come out with a clear path to what may happen.
MP: You’ve said that when you were a young journalist in New York, there was no language for sexual harassment. How did we get to the #MeToo movement?
GS: It’s the logical development of what has been growing since the 1970s. Students at Cornell University invented the term “sexual harassment.” They were trying to describe what happened to them on summer jobs. Then we – MS Magazine – did a cover story. We used a puppet on the cover because we didn’t want to be too shocking. But even so, supermarkets wouldn’t carry the magazine.
Then Catharine MacKinnon – our legal theoretician bar none, born in this state – included sexual harassment under sex discrimination law. Then there were three cases, all brought by black women, two against the government and one against a bank, and all were won. It’s been a progression since the early 1970s.
It wasn’t such a problem for me because I was always a freelancer. I never had a job, so I couldn’t be fired. When a new woman freelancer arrived in New York, I would share with her the names of editors she could work with.
MP: Imagine you’re 28 – the age when you infiltrated the Playboy Club and wrote about it – only it’s 2020. What are you doing now?
GS: Trying to get rid of Donald Trump. Nothing is more important, right? We all have to do that. Who is the sexual harasser? The number of complaints against him has risen to 100. But the press seems to think the story has already been told.
We’re the majority and he’s not. He never won the popular vote. He won largely because of the Electoral College, and also because after eight years of one party, people vote for change for the sake of change.
I’m worried – I think we’re all worried – about the legality of the vote, and what happens when people go to the polls. We’re worried about Russia and a lot of things. But I’m not worried about the majority of Americans. I think they clearly are not going to vote for Donald Trump.
MP: You call yourself a hopeaholic. Are you feeling hopeful?
GS: Yes. Not unrealistic, because there are all these dangers. But I think just from traveling and listening to people, I hear the evidence that the majority was never for him. It’s a third of the country that’s mad, because they are being deprived of the old hierarchical divisions – race, gender, class – they depended on.
MP: Is the patriarchy crumbling?
Yes. It’s crumbling partly because the strain of being superior is causing all kinds of health problems. And mostly because the democratic movement of saying “Hello, human beings are all human, we’re each unique individuals, gender is made up, race is made up” – that understanding is growing. But it’s not going to be easy.
*** Earlier that day, we were texting a dear friend in Atlanta, an African-American former civil rights worker around Steinem’s age. We mentioned that we were on our way to interview Steinem. She texted back, “Give her a great big THANKS from an 86-yr-wise Greatgranny that she helped to set free!”
During the Carlson Lecture, Miller asked Steinem a question submitted by a member of the audience: “It’s been 100 years since women gained the right to vote, yet we’re still legislating women’s bodies. How do we ensure women are at the center of making choices about their rights?” Steinem had a one-word answer: “Vote.”
Soon after, she said, “I’m going to work my heart out for any of the Democratic candidates.”
Julie Taymor’s new movie, “The Glorias,” is based on Steinem’s New York Times best-selling memoir “My Life on the Road.” It will be released in the fall, ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
The Distinguished Carlson Lecture series is presented by the Humphrey School of Public Affairs with support from Carlson and the Carlson Family Foundation.

Texto completo: (JTA) — Steven Spielberg’s film production company has acquired the rights to a soon-to-be published novel about the unlikely friendship between an Israeli father and a Palestinian father who each lost a daughter to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
“Apeirogon” by Colum McCann, will be published by Random House on Feb. 25. Its acquisition by Amblin Partners was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter, which did not say what the company paid for the rights.
The novel, which tells the story of how the fathers turned their grief into activism, has been named a most anticipated book of 2020 by The New York Times.
“Steven Spielberg and his company have always operated at the cutting edge of storytelling,” the Dublin-born McCann, an international bestselling author, told the Hollywood Reporter. “Their work is fueled by a deep moral concern. They go to the core of the issues of our day. I’m delighted that the story of Rami and Bassam will be in their hands.”
Amblin co-financed and produced “1917,” which won three Oscars this week.
Apeirogon means a shape with a countably infinite number of sides.

The Taliban's lies in the New York Times

Texto completo: The Taliban is lying. That's my response to Sirajuddin Haqqani's New York Times opinion article on Thursday, "What We, the Taliban, Want."
As my colleague Becket Adams observes, the choice to allow the Taliban to write this article is itself questionable. But Haqqani's words are also a masterpiece in deception.
Haqqani is indeed the deputy leader of the Afghan Taliban and the leader of his Haqqani network subgroup. His article thus suggests seriousness about the imminence of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal. The problem is that his wordplay indicates commitments he has very little intention of keeping.
The most ludicrous commitment comes with his pledge to "find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity."

Really?
Taliban-Haqqani ideology exists at the warped intersection of extremist Sunni-Deobandi Islam, Pashtun tribal politics, and corruption. It embraces theological foundations of deception and has no regard for "merit." Unless, that is, the merit is measured by that which fuels Taliban patronage networks and fosters vicious authoritarianism.
Similarly, Haqqani might be serious in saying he wants women to have education and employment rights. But only so far as the education is in women's responsibility to kneel to authoritarianism and their employment in absolute subservience to men.

Equally absurd is his response to concerns over whether Afghanistan will remain a democracy after a peace deal is signed and American troops withdraw: "My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans."
Haqqani is both an ideological fanatic and a crime lord of drug cartel form. Under his leadership, the network has embraced criminal enterprises such as kidnap-for-ransom while adopting a wide range of money laundering operations. The incompatibility of these operations with basic tenets of Islam, including the Islam that he claims to so nobly serve, says much about the pertinence of his "consensus" prose.
But it is Haqqani's concluding promise to build a "shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace" that demands our final attention. Because for him, "dignity" carries very different connotations than it does for us.
Don't get me wrong. The fact that the Taliban are even willing to talk is positive. But until their senior leaders are brought closer to the understanding that we will not abandon Afghan democracy (at least in the cities), end-state negotiations are pointless. They will play us for time and then for fools.
And with his Quetta Shura partners, masters of lies, and their Pakistani ISI intelligence service allies, the Taliban will again dominate this impoverished South Asian nation. With time, they will invite Salafi-Jihadists like al Qaeda back to their former bases (Haqqani is close with internationally minded jihadist networks).
There's a better way. And no, it's not to fight for village control in Helmand province and terrain control in Nangarhar province.
It's to retain a small U.S. force alongside our NATO allies to keep training Afghan security forces, to develop their capabilities in aviation, intelligence, logistics, and command, and to help them defend key cities and highways from insurgent attacks. That strategy will force the Taliban to a new understanding of greater compromise while also mitigating the human and economic costs our Afghanistan mission has brought thus far.
Then a peace deal can be signed, one that will hold without sacrificing our critical interests.

Obituary: Charles Portis, 1933-2020

Texto completo: Charles Portis was a newspaperman first, a novelist second, and a recluse third.
Not that the media saw it that way. In 2010, to coincide with the release of the Coen brothers’ film adaptation of Portis’s classic 1968 Western novel, True Grit, the New York Times gave this headline to a profile of the author: “True grit, odd wit: And fame? No, thanks.”
Press accounts of Portis’s death last week proved the persistence of his image as an ink-stained mystery man. The New York Times’s headline this time: “Charles Portis, elusive author of ‘True Grit,’ dies at 86.”
Of course, there was nothing “elusive” about Portis’s writings. Consider, for example, the hilariously candid, unequivocal language of the revenge-mad heroine of True Grit, Mattie Ross. Early in the novel, Ross says the following about the miscreant who offed her father: “That night Tom Chaney went to a barroom and got into a game of cards with some ‘riffraff’ like himself and lost his wages,” Ross says, clear as a bell. “He did not take the loss like a man but went back up to the room at the boardinghouse and sulled up like a possum.”
Such descriptive, clearheaded prose notwithstanding, Portis did his part to earn his reputation as a literary lone wolf. A native of El Dorado, Arkansas, Portis chucked a newspapering career that had landed him at the New York Herald Tribune to return to his backcountry roots with the goal of producing fiction. On returning home, Portis was said to have written from a fishing shack, much to the delight of onetime New York Herald Tribune colleague Tom Wolfe, who said in a 1972 piece: “A fishing shack! In Arkansas! It was too goddamned perfect to be true, and yet there it was.”
The setting was not, apparently, a cauldron of productivity. He eked out five novels, averaging about one per decade until the turn of the millennium: The brilliant True Grit was preceded by Norwood in 1966 and followed by The Dog of the South (1979), Masters of Atlantis (1985), and Gringos (1991).
In a 2013 article in Men’s Journal, Wolfe remembered Portis explaining his rationale for omitting a photo of himself on the back jacket of Norwood: “Charlie had this beautiful Southern mountain drawl — not the lowlands drawl — and he said, ‘Well, I figure that nobody’s going to buy this book because of how I look, and nobody’s going to not buy the book because of how I don’t look,’” Wolfe recalled. “And I said, ‘Actually, that’s not a bad strategy.’”
Interviews with Portis were scarce as hen's teeth. He is quoted here and there, but he never sat for a one-on-one with The Paris Review or at the round table of Charlie Rose.
Portis’s anti-publicity stance, too, fed the perception of him as a mythically hermitic figure. By the time the Coen brothers’ True Grit made its way to theaters, Portis’s novels had been freshly issued in paperback, and he was the subject of much fawning. In 2010, the Oxford American paid homage to him at a fancy shindig, though a photographer assigned to cover the occasion couldn’t easily locate him, according to an account in the Arkansas Times: “I’m telling you, dude is like a recluse.”
Portis’s quest for solitude was sincere. The most thoroughgoing obituary published since his death, found in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, suggests not a man toying with the public — he did not, as did Thomas Pynchon, make a cameo on The Simpsons — but of a newspaperman who never got used to the idea that he would be the subject of the story. One of his two brothers, Jonathan Portis, said: “He preferred to go as an unknown person because he was a people watcher. He would hear snatches of conversations or see people who had a particular look, and he would take note of that.”
His literary legacy is scant but enduring. True Grit certainly anticipated what might be termed the twee historical genre, exemplified in Pynchon’s Mason & Dixon or the movie The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Even the revenge fantasies of Quentin Tarantino are foretold in it. But all of his novels express affection for the mavericks who dot the American scene.

Burisma consultant and Hunter Biden associate requested meeting with State Department on Ukraine affairs

Texto completo: A consultant for Burisma Holdings and associate of Hunter Biden reached out to the State Department to meet about "troubling events" in Ukraine.
Emails released by the State Department show communications between Sally Painter, a consulting representative for the Ukrainian gas company, and William Russo, the top aide of former Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken in 2016.
In one email in June, Painter requested a meeting with Blinker to discuss events in Ukraine.
“Per my conversation with Tony at the Truman event, Karen Tramontano and I would like to have a brief coffee with Tony at his earliest convenience regarding some troubling events we are seeing n [sic] Ukraine. (He said yes)," Painter wrote to Russo, who currently works as an adviser to the Joe Biden presidential campaign, in an email. "Karen was President Clinton's Deputy Chief of Staff and we are just back from Kiev. Many thanks for your help."
The email exchange between Painter and Russo does not mention Burisma by name, raising questions about what specifically they discussed.
The Daily Caller reports Tramontano, who was mentioned in the email as Painter's partner at Blue Star Strategies, previously reached out to the State Department to specifically discuss the Burisma, according to federal records. She argued the company was not corrupt, contrary to what the United States suspected. “According to Tramontano there is no evidence of corruption, has been no hearing or process, and evidence to the contrary has not been considered,” a State Department official wrote in an email.
In 2019, the New York Times found Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, connected Blue Star Strategies with Burisma in order to fight allegations of corruption against the firm. State Department records, according to the Daily Caller, also show Hunter Biden meeting with Blinker in May 2015 to obtain his "advice on a couple of things," to which Blinken said he would "absolutely" be willing to meet. It is unclear what the two discussed in their meeting.
Hunter Biden and Painter first connected when the two worked as directors of the Truman National Security Project, a left-leaning nonprofit group that educates activists on matters of foreign policy. In 2016, the Truman National Security Project hosted Blinken at a forum, reportedly where Painter first requested a meeting.
The controversy follows Joe Biden's public boast that he pressured Ukraine to fire a controversial top prosecutor, whose office had investigated Burisma owner and Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, by threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees.
The former vice president has repeatedly denied doing so in order to benefit his son, who was on Burisma's board, in the face of corruption allegations by President Trump and his allies, which became the center of an impeachment effort.

Texto completo: Kellyanne Conway said 2020 Democrat Michael Bloomberg should start firing campaign staffers after his first presidential debate appearance.
Conway sounded off on the former New York City mayor’s performance on Twitter while he contended with his primary opponents on the debate stage in Las Vegas Wednesday night. The White House adviser insinuated that Bloomberg performed poorly, insisting he should fire any staffers who claim he did the opposite.
“Mike Bloomberg should fire two groups of people tonight: those who helped with debate prep and those who squeal 'GREAT JOB!!' as he exits the debate stage,” she tweeted.TweetConway also retweeted several other accounts critical of Bloomberg’s debate performance, including a tweet from the New York Times that highlighted a moment in the debate when Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren slammed Bloomberg for his past comments on women.
"I’d like to talk about who we’re running against," Warren said, "a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump; I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg."TweetSpeaking at a rally in Phoenix, President Trump weighed in on Bloomberg’s appearance as well. The president took the stage after the opening moments of the Democratic debate and said the billionaire was getting "pounded."
"I hear he's getting pounded tonight. I hear they're pounding him," Trump said. "I think he spent all this money, he has maybe 15 points."

Spy chief team told House Intelligence Committee that Russia supports Trump in 2020

Texto completo: Intelligence officials warned members of the House Intelligence Committee last week the Russians were attempting to interfere in the 2020 presidential contest with the goal of helping Trump win reelection, according to reports.
The briefing was conducted by Shelby Pierson, the Intelligence Community election threats executive under outgoing acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. During the meeting, Pierson warned that “Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected,” according to five people familiar with the matter cited by the New York Times.
Russian interference on behalf of Trump in 2020 has not been publicly confirmed by the U.S. Intelligence Community.
Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded last year the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election in a “sweeping and systematic” fashion, but he did not establish any criminal conspiracy between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham are leading an internal inquiry into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.
The day after last Thursday's briefing, the report claimed Trump “berated” Maguire for letting it happen, also alleging Trump “cited the presence in the briefing” of Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff “as a particular irritant.”

In a separate piece on Thursday, the Washington Post cited sources who claimed Trump “erroneously believed” Pierson had given intelligence “exclusively” to Schiff and that Trump thought “it would be helpful to Democrats if released publicly.” That report cited an anonymous source who claimed “there was a dressing down” of Maguire by Trump and “that was the catalyst” that led Trump to replace him with Trump ally and U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell on Wednesday.
The New York Times cited two administration officials who cast doubt on the notion that Trump was irritated at Maguire because of the briefing, saying that “the timing was coincidental," that “Mr. Grenell had been in discussions with the administration about taking on new roles,” and that “Mr. Trump had never felt a personal kinship with Mr. Maguire.”
Former Rep. Trey Gowdy said the buzz on Capitol Hill is that Trump was not angry with Maguire before announcing his exit. "My sources on the Hill tell me he was not upset with Maguire, that this was a move that was coming anyway," Gowdy said on Fox News.
Trump tweeted on Wednesday that he “would like to thank Joe Maguire for the wonderful job he has done” and said, “We look forward to working with him closely, perhaps in another capacity within the Administration!”

Grenell tweeted early Thursday to say he would only be the “Acting” head of the Intelligence Community and that “the President will announce the Nominee (not me) sometime soon.”

The ambassador, a longtime Russia hawk, has been a forceful and effective advocate for Trump’s foreign policy agenda. Grenell has taken on an outsize role in pressuring NATO to increase spending, criticizing Germany for getting too cozy with Russian energy endeavors, and pushing for the worldwide decriminalization of homosexuality.

“Members on both sides participated, including ranking member Nunes, and heard the exact same briefing from experts across the Intelligence Community,” a committee official cited by the Washington Post said about last week’s briefing. “No special or separate briefing was provided to one side or to any single member, including the chairman.”
The New York Times also said, "Mr. Trump’s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that Mr. Trump has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security" during the briefing.
Beyond the indictments against members of Russian military intelligence handed down by Mueller, the Trump administration has imposed a number of significant sanctions against Russia and has built up the U.S. military’s presence in Eastern Europe. Its push for increased spending by NATO member countries has resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in increased military expenditures to confront an increasingly combative Russia.
Jack Langer, the communications director for Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the committee, told the Washington Examiner he could not divulge details about classified briefings.
A spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told the Washington Examiner: “Thank you for your query; we have nothing for you at this time.”
Neither the White House nor Schiff’s office immediately responded to a request for comment.
Trump has a history of speaking out against members of the intelligence and law enforcement communities, including former FBI Director James Comey. He called Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election a "witch hunt."
Earlier this month, when Rep. Eric Swalwell pressed FBI Director Christopher Wray about whether the Russians were actively helping any specific campaign, Wray deflected.
“I’d have to think about whether or not I can say anything in an open setting like that,” Wray told the House Judiciary Committee. “But I would say, in general, that the efforts to sow discord on both sides of an issue and to generate controversy and to generate distrust in our democratic institutions on our election process, that is very much ongoing.”

Pierson told WTOP earlier this month that “election security remains a top priority for the U.S. federal government as a whole” and said, “We have significantly evolved since 2016, and I don’t imagine we’ll decelerate anytime soon.”

She acknowledged last month the extent of Russian interference in 2016 but emphasized that other countries pose challenges.
“We do not assess that any other country influenced the United States election in 2016 on the scale of what the Russians did,” Pierson said on CBS News’s Intelligence Matters podcast, adding that, when it comes to 2020, “We see a more complicated threat landscape. This is not just a Russia-only problem.”

Texto completo: Former Rep. Trey Gowdy said the buzz on Capitol Hill is that President Trump was not angry with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire before announcing his exit.
The South Carolina Republican cast doubt on reporting Thursday about how a classified briefing to the House Intelligence Committee last week, in which they were told Russia is interfering in the 2020 election to get Trump reelected, may have cost Maguire his job and his shot at taking on the spy chief role permanently.
"My sources on the Hill tell me he was not upset with Maguire, that this was a move that was coming anyway. He just happened to go with Ambassador Grenell instead of [Rep.] Chris Stewart and some other qualified candidates," Gowdy said on Fox News.
The New York Times reported sources saying Shelby Pierson, an aide to Maguire, angered Trump by giving the classified briefing, which he feared could be used against him, after which the president "berated" Maguire. An NBC News report pinned Maguire's ouster on this incident.
The president announced on Wednesday that Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany and a Trump ally, would replace Maguire as acting DNI.
Gowdy argued that Maguire, as an acting official, had a deadline coming up in March, and that the former congressman's "buddies" told him that Maguire was already on his way out.
Gowdy conceded that Trump was likely unhappy but said he was sure that it was House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff's presence at the briefing that got him upset. A Washington Post cited sources who claimed Trump “erroneously believed” Pierson had given intelligence “exclusively” to Schiff, a California Democrat who has repeatedly insisted there was evidence of Russia collusion "in plain sight" and was a lead impeachment manager in the Senate trial against Trump.
"Why would you trust Adam Schiff for the 100th time? But my sources tell me that is not why he got rid of Maguire, and it was coming anyway," he said.

'Did you pay him for this piece?': Liz Cheney questions New York Times for publishing story by Taliban leader

Texto completo: Rep. Liz Cheney questioned whether the New York Times forgot the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks when it agreed to publish an editorial by a leader of the Taliban.
On Thursday, the New York Times published an opinion piece from Sirajuddin Haqqani, the deputy leader of the Taliban, in which he described what the Taliban wants in return for peace. Cheney, a top Republican from Wyoming, bashed the outlet for publishing the story.
"I have some questions for [the New York Times] since they decided to give the Taliban a forum to spew garbage, like, 'We did not choose our war...We were forced to defend ourselves,'" Cheney said.
Tweet
She questioned if the New York Times paid the author for the story, asking, “The author is a designated global terrorist. Did you pay him for this piece?”
The outlet’s senior correspondent in Afghanistan, Mujib Mashal, did not directly respond to Cheney’s remarks but noted earlier that the New York Times did not agree with Haqqani’s description of the situation in the Middle East.
Tweet
“The piece by Siraj Haqqani in [the New York Times] - which's independent of our news operations & judgment - omits the most fundamental fact: that Siraj is no Taliban peace-maker as he paints himself, that he's behind some of most ruthless attacks of this war with many civilian lives lost,” Mashal wrote.
He added, “I know people have strong views on this. Sorry, I can't answer. But, as the bottom of the piece says, our Opinion editors appreciate hearing from, and are ‘committed to publishing a diversity of letters.’”
Tweet
Cheney is the third-most powerful Republican in the House. Her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, advocated for U.S. forces to expand from Afghanistan into Iraq.

Texto completo: A TV-savvy incumbent flies in on the day of the Democratic caucuses, provoking accusations that he is hijacking the national press corps and upstaging the eight candidates vying to be his opponent in November.
Not Donald Trump — but Ronald Reagan in Iowa in 1984 on his way to an eventual 49-state win, powered by an economic recovery and a revival in national confidence.
Trump campaign officials say their primary-raiding tour — taking in Arizona, Colorado and Nevada over the next three days — is not modeled on Reagan’s convention-busting precedent but plays instead to their candidate’s unique gifts and the demands of a modern campaign.
“This is based on Donald Trump and his ability to connect with people and to draw crowds,” said Tim Murtaugh, director of communications for the Trump 2020 campaign. “And in Iowa and New Hampshire it was a great opportunity to use the fact that you had Republican caucus or primary events in those states to build our ground game, to gather data, to flex our organizational muscles, and for the president to energize his supporters.”
The mass rallies were a highly visible part of Trump’s unlikely 2016 victory, generating hours of free television time. This time around, campaign officials say the events are a powerful way of turning supporters into volunteers and collecting phone numbers and email addresses of attendees.
Democrats fear the early campaign launch gives Trump a huge head start while their candidates slug it out in crowded primary field.
Trump appeared at the Knapp Center in Des Moines, Iowa, four days before Democrats in the state gathered to pick a candidate. In Manchester, New Hampshire, his rally was the day before the Democratic primary and had the added benefit of shutting down city center streets just as his opponents were shuttling around on their final push.
The events were credited with mobilizing support and driving record turnout for an uncompetitive GOP nomination race. Trump won more than 31,000 votes in the Iowa Republican caucus, beating President Barack Obama’s 25,000 in his 2012 reelection effort. And in New Hampshire he won almost 130,000 votes — more than double Obama’s number.
This week, the president is out West. He is in Phoenix on Wednesday, Colorado Springs on Thursday and Las Vegas on Friday, a day before its primary. Charlotte, North Carolina, comes at the start of next month, ahead of its Super Tuesday primary.
Murtaugh said the president had always planned to do a western swing.
“These are key states that the president can and will win in 2020,” he said. “And if it draws attention away from the Democrats in Nevada then gosh, what an unbelievable coincidence.”
The sentiment is similar to 1984. While Democrats complained at Reagan’s appearance in Iowa, on the same day as the caucus, Republicans could only smile. As James Lake, press secretary for the Reagan-Bush Campaign, told the New York Times: “I must say, it's always fun to see your opponents squirm.”
That contrast was on full display on Wednesday. Trump appeared onstage in Phoenix, in full election campaign mode, while six Democratic hopeful clashed in the ninth televised debate as they battle it our for their party nomination. It marked the first appearance of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who is expected to draw much of the fire from the other candidates.
Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, said it was classic counter-programming, drawn from strategies used by TV networks. "The Democrats will have two to three hours tonight and how do you counter that? By having your own programming," he said. "Democrats are going to have to wise up.”
He added that the sooner the candidates could call a truce and turn their fire on Trump the better. The danger was that the Trump campaign was already far ahead in organizing for the general election, raising money and deploying its messaging.
“What we have is a situation where the Democrats beat each other up and then Donald Trump beats them up,” he said.

Texto completo: It’s true that a lot of us are bored and exhausted. Last week, I asked my students, undergrads in a top-10 business school, why money is good to have. I thought they would say something about the inexhaustible choice, the power, the frictionless movement that it represents and enables. Instead, most of them said that money provides stability. These are the lions and tigers of our economy, perfectly poised to take over and rule. And none of them, with the notable exception of a few Chinese students, wanted to build an empire, become a mogul, see their competitors driven before them and hear the lamentations of their spouses and dogs. Old-fashioned acquisitive barbarism isn’t especially good or ennobling, but its absence was jarring.
This listlessness, this knee-jerk timidity even among the elite of the elites, squares well with the thesis of Ross Douthat’s instructive new book, The Decadent Society: How We Became the Victims of Our Own Success. Douthat, the Harvard-educated, diabolically fair-minded right wing of the New York Times opinion page, has written a rather heavy, sad, and at times head-scratching book to explain our culture’s sadness and slowness, and to offer some smart speculations about where it all might lead. The news is mostly dim and dispiriting. If Douthat is right, then we could be in for many more years of the muddy, tepid late winter of Western civilization.
Books_Decadent_022520.jpg
Decadence, in Douthat’s reading, is a combination of “economic stagnation, institutional decay, and cultural and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development.” His thesis that the industrialized West exists in such a state is immediately resonant. We all know about the deaths of despair, the growing mistrust of our institutions, the alienation, the decline of the American dream, and the very, very odd political candidates winning lots of votes. Douthat’s book is most useful as a careful catalog of these and other, less readily visible forms of decadence.
One surprising aspect of Douthat’s book is its heavy emphasis on space travel and space-related TV shows and movies. The first line of The Decadent Society describes the 1969 Apollo moon landing as “the peak of human accomplishment and daring, the greatest single triumph of modern science and government and industry, the most extraordinary endeavor of the American age in modern history.” I find myself genuinely puzzled here. I’m a bit younger than Douthat, but neither of us was alive for the moon landing. I can make myself feel something about it if I concentrate, but it’s certainly not front of mind when I think about human greatness. When Douthat announces a few pages later that “since Apollo, we have entered into decadence,” I have to meet him more than halfway.
Douthat’s sadness about our recent earth-boundedness is of a piece with his sense that technological innovation has slowed to a pitiable crawl. He quotes Peter Thiel: “We were promised flying cars. We got 140 characters.” Douthat makes a strong case that much of the Silicon Valley innovation behemoth runs on what he calls “let’s pretendism” — the endless pumping of investment dollars into “technologies that have almost arrived, business models that are on their way to profitability, by runways that go on and on without ever achieving liftoff.” Worse, this fluffed-up impotence is actually one of the bright spots in an economy that is, for most Americans, frustratingly stalled. Douthat explains that this economic-technological stagnation is allied with a sclerotic political establishment, plummeting birth rates, and a pop culture addicted to rote repetition: the “four horsemen” of our decadence.
Much of Douthat’s picture is just simply true, even if the links between the different horsemen are somewhat obscure. Why, exactly, are we decadent? The death of God? Selfish elites? Boring bourgeois hedonism? Each of these makes an appearance or two. But it is unclear whether Douthat believes there is a common etiology for our various social illnesses, and it’s hard to treat a disease if you don’t know what caused it.
The question of cultural decadence is a big one, and here, The Decadent Society is at its weakest. Douthat is not at all wrong that Hollywood studios are garbage-recycling operations, but are we also stalled in our art galleries, our literary fiction, our magazines of ideas? Here, Douthat is silent. Yet culture higher than the local movie theater is also culture, and in fact, matters a great deal. It is precisely in these less popular precincts that movements are stirring that could potentially put our tired, old epoch to bed — more on this below.
In possibly the strongest, most original part of the book, Douthat argues that our decadence might be uniquely well-designed to last a long time. Pornography, opioids, internet addiction, and other distractions keep us indoors, not stabbing, raping, or impregnating each other. We’re unhappy, to be sure, but at least we’re docile. As Douthat explains, “Teenagers in the internet age are more stressed out, more anxiety ridden, more prone to depression than teenagers in the more dangerous past. But their unhappiness is a form of anomie, not a spur to acting out.” Things could on like this, more or less, for a long time.
Yet this prediction of stasis returns us to the question of culture. The disruptions of the Trump era have unleashed a flurry of excitement and creativity among idealistic, hypereducated young people. My peers in academia, the arts, and journalism are more galvanized than I’ve ever seen them. New think tanks and magazines and institutes are being planned and launched. The Right and Left are thinking more broadly and ambitiously than they have since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The internet is electric with ridiculous new ideologies, supplements, mysticisms, and rules for life. Maybe it will all come to nothing, but such wild energy is a necessary condition for the birth of anything good and new. Occupants of massive platforms such as Douthat’s should be combing over these seedbeds, looking for the greenest shoots, and watering them with encouragement, advice, and exposure.
When Douthat looks around for sources of renaissance, however, he looks chiefly to Africa, with its young, religious, and rapidly growing population. He imagines a world where European cathedrals are packed with African worshipers come to carry on a Western Christian civilization that has fallen victim to its own success and comfort. He sees in Wakanda, the fictional African utopia of the Marvel flick Black Panther, a “yearning for an out-of-Africa renaissance, for an African-shaped future that’s dynamic rather than dystopian: Make Africa Great, and the Make the World Great Again As Well.”
The book ends with one last fanciful fling: “It shouldn’t surprise anyone if decadence ends with people looking heavenward: toward God, toward the stars, or both. So down on your knees — and start working on that warp drive.” Douthat is a serious man, a careful reader, and for years, the most interesting columnist at our paper of record; our public discourse profits from his continued interventions. But there is something distinctly odd about him tossing his hope for our society toward the distant salvation of divine intervention, space adventure, and bespoke African Christians. In its pessimism, its assumption of powerlessness, it smacks of something specific: decadence.

Quick fix for multiemployer pensions unlikely on Capitol Hill

Texto completo: Congress is unlikely to fix the country's formidable multiemployer pension crisis before the 2020 elections, even though many of the plans face insolvency in the not-too-distant future.
"This crisis is severe and gets worse every day," Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley said upon introducing a plan to address the shortfall. The Iowa Republican added that "we need to act quickly."
Rachel Greszler, a researcher at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the urgency to act on saving these pensions is growing because more of them are nearing insolvency.
"I hear more reports about the need to do something because there are plenty of … plans out there that are approaching insolvency," Greszler said.
The term "insolvency" does not mean that the plans will be broke with no financial resources. It refers to pensions not having a sufficient amount of resources to distribute benefits that were promised to retirees, which can mean benefit cuts to those recipients.
Since 2015, more than 20 multiemployer pensions have requested the Treasury Department cut benefits because of insolvency, according to the Pension Rights Center. On that list is the United Furniture Workers Pension, which is facing insolvency in 2021. The Treasury Department approved its benefit cuts to its more than 9,000 retirees. The Central States Pension Fund is also on the list. It has more than 400,000 participants, who are either retired or currently working, and was denied its request for benefit cuts because the reductions would not be enough to make it solvent over the long term. The fund is projected to become insolvent in 2025.
In total, as many as 117 multiemployer pension plans covering 1.4 million participants are underfunded by $56.5 billion and have informed regulators and participants that they could fail within the next 20 years. The plans don't have enough money to pay the full promised benefits, according to Cheiron Inc., a pension actuarial firm.
"If Congress doesn't act soon, many more plans will fail, and participants will lose their pensions," said Joshua Davis, a principal consulting actuary at Cheiron, who analyzed the filings.
Last December, Congress approved, and President Trump signed into law, a $1.4 trillion spending bill that also rescued the 1974 United Mine Workers of America Pension Plan from insolvency. Nearly 100,000 retired coal miners depend on the fund to make ends meet, and its enactment marks the first time in more than a generation that taxpayers bailed out a pension plan, according to the New York Times.
In its effort to save more plans from insolvency, the Democrat-controlled House in July passed legislation allowing the Treasury Department to provide loans to underfunded, multiemployer pensions. The loans would stop benefit cuts to retirees and would be paid back over 30 years. But it is not clear if the pensions receiving these loans will be financially able to pay them back.
Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently drew attention to this possibility during a committee markup of the bill.
"Forcing hand-picked plans to accept crushing balloon payment loans they can never hope to repay, while putting off necessary reforms to make them solvent, hurts workers, businesses, and innocent taxpayers who did nothing to create these failed plans," he said in prepared remarks, adding that "to think the government can fully guarantee pension promises based on a 7 or 8% annual return — that's the same fantasy that got us into this mess."
A loan from the federal government that is not repaid is considered a bailout by some on Capitol Hill. The House-approved bill is not expected to pass the Senate, according to Michael Zona, communications director for Grassley's committee.
"For any legislation to pass, it must address the root of the problem instead of simply bailing out a failed system that will end up needing another bailout down the road," he said via email.
Grassley teamed up last November with Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee on a proposal to fix multiemployer plans that do not include a bailout. It, in part, allows the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the organization tasked with saving underfunded pensions, to increase premiums paid by multiemployer plans. The senators are receiving comments on their plan before they formally introduce it.
The discussion on how to fix the multiemployer pension problem is ongoing between the House and Senate. Grassley and House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, are engaged in the discussion. But Neal is pushing the House-passed bill that the Senate has shown little interest in pursuing.
"Chairman Neal has spoken with Sen. Grassley about his bipartisan multiemployer pensions legislation and is continuing to urge swift Senate passage," a committee spokesperson said.
Until lawmakers get on the same page in terms of moving legislation that can pass both chambers of Congress, there is little chance for fixing multiemployer pensions any time soon.

Biden and Buttigieg say they won't raise small-business taxes, but have proposals to do just that

Texto completo: Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg both said in the Democratic presidential debate that they wouldn't raise taxes for small businesses, but both have tax-increase proposals aimed at these entities.
"Taxes on small businesses won't go up," Biden said during the debate in Las Vegas, Nevada.
The former vice president proposes increasing the top income tax rate from 37% to 39.6%, the rate that it was before the 2017 GOP tax cut legislation. That rate hike would also affect many small businesses, nearly three-quarters of which file through the individual side of the tax code, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.
Biden’s platform does not propose a tax cut to offset the tax increase.
Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, proposes ending the 20% deduction for small businesses that file their taxes through the individual side of the tax code, rather than as C corporations, created by the 2017 tax overhaul.
More than 14 million taxpayers claimed the pass-through deduction, as it is known, on their 2018 taxes, and a large majority had adjusted gross income between $100,000 and $200,000, according to CNBC.
Asked if he would raise taxes during Wednesday night's debate, Buttigieg responded, "Not if they are small businesses."
The tax increases are a potential risk for Biden and Buttigieg as they try to win over small-business owners to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, especially repealing the pass-through deduction. Kevin Kuhlman, a senior director of federal government relations at the NFIB, recently told the Washington Examiner that small-business owners hold this deduction in high regard.
“In our research, we found that 72% of business owners find that deduction to be important, and they’re using anything from it to invest in the business and invest in the employees by increasing compensation and creating jobs,” he said. "So, we have seen significant benefits from the implementation of the small-business deduction."

Texto completo: MSNBC host Chris Matthews accused President Trump of hiding Russian interference in the 2020 election.
Matthews expressed anger after the New York Times published a report late on Thursday detailing a Feb. 13 meeting called by a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee to discuss the "integrity of our upcoming elections."
"Here we are again," said Matthews. "The president doesn't want Democrats to know what's going on. He doesn't want anybody in this country to know what the Russians are up to. He's apparently out there suppressing the fact that they're out there, now, again, doing what they did in 2016, putting their thumb on the scale on his behalf to beat the Democrats."
Chris Matthews accuses Trump of coordinating with Russia in election
The new information provided to House lawmakers from the intelligence community suggests Russia supports the reelection of Trump in the 2020 election and is willing to participate in coordinated hacking and social media campaigns to ensure his reelection.
Trump was accused of colluding with Russian intelligence, including Putin himself, in the 2016 presidential election. The president said he was exonerated by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into collusion, though Mueller rebuffed Trump's claim.
"Here we are at the end of a long impeachment exercise, which ended up in the so-called acquittal of the president, and now, we were told that, no, he's going to learn his lesson, and now, we're learning, incredibly, the whole damn thing is starting over again," Matthews said. "The Russians are into their hacking, into their bogus use of social media, the whole works. The president of the United States is trying to keep that secret from us in the way he was denying it back in 2016."
Chris Matthews accuses Trump of coordinating with Russia
Matthews floated the idea that outgoing head of national intelligence Joseph Maguire was replaced by Richard Grenell, though the New York Times piece claimed the timing was coincidental.
"It's hard to come up with the words for what is going on right now," added Matthews. "Here they go again, as if they can just get away with the daylight robbery again, with the president of the United States helping them to keep it secret — helping to keep it secret instead of trying to stop them!"

New York Times publishes Taliban propaganda

Texto completo: It used to be that a murderous regime needed a pliable Western journalist to get its propaganda printed in the New York Times.

Not anymore!
It can submit directly to the Times opinion section, as the Taliban proved this week.

“What We, the Taliban, Want,” reads the actual headline to an article published Thursday by an actual American newsroom.

The op-ed, authored by Taliban deputy leader and suspected terrorist Sirajuddin Haqqani, opens with a series of sentences that attempt to “both sides” the conflict between the Taliban and the United States and present the Americans as unreliable and untrustworthy negotiators.

“When our representatives started negotiating with the United States in 2018, our confidence that the talks would yield results was close to zero,” he writes. “We did not trust American intentions after 18 years of war and several previous attempts at negotiation that had proved futile.”

Haqqani adds, “Nevertheless, we decided to try once more. The long war has exacted a terrible cost from everyone. We thought it unwise to dismiss any potential opportunity for peace no matter how meager the prospects of its success.”

Peace is good, I will give him that. No sense in criticizing the Times for publishing a call for peace, even if it comes from a man who is wanted in connection to deadly terrorist assaults on civilians, assassination plots, and multiple attacks on U.S. and coalition forces.

But then Haqqani writes, “We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves.”

This is a damnable lie. The Taliban 100% chose this conflict with the U.S.

No one forced the Taliban to invite al Qaeda to establish its base of operations in Afghanistan in exchange for Saudi money. No one forced the Taliban to deny the U.S. lawful entry into Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. No one forced the Taliban to fight alongside al Qaeda. This fight was of the Taliban’s own choosing and now, having suffered dearly for its choices, it is using an American newspaper to rewrite history and present itself as a victim.

The remainder of Haqqani’s op-ed is much of the same, seeking to present the Taliban as a stoic and proud organization that wants only to make peace with a country whose negotiators keep “flip-flopping” and “moving goal posts.”

“Even when President Trump called off the talks, we kept the door to peace open because we Afghans suffer the most from the continuation of the war," he wrote. "No peace agreement, following on the heels of such intensive talks, comes without mutual compromises.”

He adds, “That we stuck with such turbulent talks with the enemy we have fought bitterly for two decades, even as death rained from the sky, testifies to our commitment to ending the hostilities and bringing peace to our country."

What faultless martyrs you are.
“The new Afghanistan will be a responsible member of the international community,” Haqqani writes. “We will remain committed to all international conventions as long as they are compatible with Islamic principles.”

His motivations make sense. Any good officer understands the necessity of propaganda and its broad dissemination in media. But what is the Times's excuse for printing his lies? Is this not the same U.S. newspaper that has been sounding the alarm nonstop since the 2016 presidential election about the dangers of disinformation online?

The ghost of the old Soviet Union must be kicking itself for having wasted so much time dealing with that idiot Walter Duranty. As it turns out, Stalin’s politburo could have just submitted op-eds downplaying and obfuscating its crimes directly to the Times’s opinion section.

Texto completo: Russia interfering in the 2020 election to get President Trump reelected is the "worst nightmare" of the spy world, according to a reporter.
Ken Dilanian, who is a national security correspondent for NBC News, made an appearance Thursday evening on MSNBC to discuss new reporting about an intelligence briefing lawmakers received last week about yet another Russian attempt to interfere in the U.S. election.
“It’s the worst nightmare of many of my sources in the intelligence world,” Dilanian said in response to a New York Times report about how Shelby Pierson, an aide to outgoing acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, was said to have angered Trump by giving a classified briefing to Congress about Russia he feared could be used against him.
According to Dilanian's reporting, a former official said this incident is what cost Maguire his job and his shot at taking on the role permanently. The president announced on Wednesday that Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany and a Trump ally, would replace Maguire as acting DNI.
"The notion that, because a briefing of that information was delivered to a bipartisan group of lawmakers, that cost Joe Maguire the job as director of national intelligence? That’s a bombshell. That’s an earthquake," Dilanian said.
"We want our intelligence officials to speak truth to power," he added.
Trump has a history of speaking out against members of the intelligence and law enforcement communities, including former FBI Director James Comey. He called special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, a "witch hunt."
As some Trump allies talk of a "deep state" trying to undermine the president, Attorney General William Barr is overseeing a review of the Russia investigation, which is conducted by U.S. Attorney John Durham.

Kirsten Gillibrand wants a new privacy agency

Información de publicación: Washington Examiner ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]. 20 Feb 2020.

Texto completo: A new bill in the Senate would create a new government agency focused on protecting consumer privacy and data security, removing that authority from the Federal Trade Commission.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's proposed Data Protection Agency would create and enforce new data protection rules. It would encourage the development of new privacy technologies that minimize or eliminate the collection of personal data. The agency would also take action against companies that deploy "pay-for-privacy" or "take-it-or-leave-it" provisions in their terms of service, according to Gillibrand, a New York Democrat.
While Gillibrand's bill faces an uphill battle to get passed in the Senate, its proposal for a new privacy agency echoes legislation introduced by two Silicon Valley Democrats late last year.
Current data privacy rules are inadequate, and a "lawlessness" is governing the data privacy space, Gillibrand wrote in a Medium post.
"You deserve to be in control of your own data," she wrote. "You have the right to know if companies are using your information for profit. You need a way to protect yourself, and you deserve a place that will look out for you."
Gillibrand's bill has received support from the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Public Citizen, the Center for Digital Democracy, and other privacy advocates.
The FTC declined to comment on Gillibrand's Data Protection Act, but FTC Chairman Joseph Simons has defended his agency's record on privacy. The agency has brought hundreds of privacy cases against tech giants, with "recent cases generating some of the largest privacy fines in the world," Simons wrote in a letter to the editor of the New York Times late last year.
Simons called for a new federal privacy law and more resources for the FTC. "But the solution to any privacy vacuum is not an untested new bureaucracy that would enter the game in the fourth quarter," he wrote. "The FTC is already a world-class, award-winning privacy agency, despite its limited authority and resources. Imagine what we could do with more."
Meanwhile, some other privacy advocates applauded Gillibrand's bill, saying an agency zeroed in on consumer privacy could provide new protections.
The success of a new agency would depend on several factors, including the resources available, said Doris Brogan, a professor at Villanova University's Charles Widger School of Law.
"The area is huge and complex and ever-changing," she said. "The problems are often under the radar until they explode, and the nature of the threats are often nuanced and subtle. So, a good idea to create a dedicated agency? Yes, to the extent the agency comes to the table with real independence, adequate resources, and genuine expertise."
However, there is the chance that a specialized agency becomes too close to the companies it attempts to regulate, a long-recognized problem called regulatory capture. "With the oversized influence of big tech, and the issues of understanding a dense, rapidly evolving, tech-heavy industry, the risk is significant," she said.
Similarly, Rich Spinelli, principal engineer at information technology services firm Core Technologies, called the proposal "intriguing."
If implemented correctly, a new agency "has the potential to hit the nail on the head in addressing and punishing abuse and misuse of data privacy caused largely by social media and other tech giants," he said.
However, Congress would need to take care of setting up the new Data Protection Agency, he added. "It has the potential to become a bloated bureaucracy if it's mission isn't clearly defined or watched over," he said.
Others questioned the value of a new agency. Issues surrounding data privacy and security are "extremely complex and significantly more nuanced than what appears on first blush," said David LaVine, founder of the tech- and engineering-focused RocLogic Marketing. The new agency could potentially create large numbers of new regulations that increase the cost of doing business, he added.
A new agency would have to limit its focus on reducing "egregious practices" at large companies collecting massive amounts of data, LaVine said. "That means it should only be applicable to a very small fraction of companies and not make every company suffer through regulation that should only be felt by a few," he said. "This agency would also recognize that data privacy is not a black and white topic, but rather one with a lot of gray area that should be dealt with in context, not absolutes."

How much does John Bolton know about Ukraine scandal? He's not saying

Texto completo: For three weeks, John Bolton had kept his counsel. After leaks from his manuscript sent shock waves through President Trump's impeachment trial and reignited demands that witnesses be called to give evidence, the man who had so far declined to give testimony was about to speak.
"I'm so pleased that Duke has been able to do what neither the House nor the Senate was able," said his host Peter Feaver, professor of political science, his words drowned out by a mix of groans, laughs, and applause from the capacity audience in the Duke University auditorium.
"Good luck," Bolton replied. In two words, he signaled his intention to spend the next hour and a quarter deflecting, dodging, and ducking questions about his working relationship with Trump in general and impeachment in particular.
Still, he was taking no chances. His contract with Duke specified that the audience was not allowed to record his words. And after three minutes of mostly introductory remarks, television crews were given the prearranged signal to turn off their cameras, which had been operating without audio anyway.
Anyone who thought that might herald the start of a candid examination of Trump's foreign policy process by his former national security adviser was swiftly disabused of the notion.
Instead, the audience got a familiar rundown of Bolton's finest moments — America's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court, the overturning of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 3379 equating Zionism with racism, and Washington pulling out of various nuclear treaties.
Feaver, the genial host, tried again, asking about Venezuela and whether Trump took a harder line than Bolton and was serious in his intention to replace Nicolas Maduro as president.
Wait for the book, came the answer from Bolton, who several times plugged his forthcoming memoir The Room Where It Happened, which is due to be published on March 17.
"Well, I'll have to say … why we can't talk about it … because you can talk about right now. This is a safe space," said Feaver, to more laughter.
There was nothing he would like better, insisted Bolton, if it weren't for the White House's "prepublication review."
"But we're in the process now and may have something to say about it later, but for now, I'm going to let it go," he said.
And so, it went on. Questions about Russia and Ukraine came and went without Bolton budging. No, he couldn't comment on whether he thought Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was "perfect," as the president claimed. "You'll love chapter 14," was his teasing reply.
Nor would he describe what it was like behind the scenes of Trump's cringingly bad meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki two years ago. "I could read a chapter from my book here and give you the answer to that question," he said.
But then, who would buy his book?
We didn't even get to the question everyone wanted to know. Was the New York Times story accurate in claiming that Trump told his national security adviser that he wanted to continue withholding $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until its government helped with investigations into Joe Biden and his son Hunter? Is the episode recounted in his manuscript? And did he know how those details, undercutting a vital part of the president's defense, came to be leaked at a crucial point of the Senate trial?
No questions and no answers. Instead, Bolton was happy to play the analyst rather than the White House insider, offering the sort of views that will no doubt eventually get him a post as a TV talking head.
And so, he was happy to criticize Trump's foreign policy for not being hawkish enough.
On Iran: "Well, I think it's failing because I don't think it lives up to its bumper sticker slogan of maximum pressure. I don't think we're applying maximum pressure on Iran."
And on North Korea: "It was perfectly evident it was going to fail."
An audience that had come to hear about the Ukraine scandal was sent on its way after an extended tease of more to follow and a tour of Bolton's (well-known) hawkish views on the world. The question now is whether his book will follow the same course.

'New Red Scare': House Democrats scrutinize FBI investigations into ethnically Chinese scientists

Texto completo: A pair of Democrats are examining the federal government’s efforts to root out suspected Chinese espionage from universities and laboratories in the United States.
Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the House Oversight Committee, and California Rep. Judy Chu asked the FBI and the National Institutes of Health to provide more information on the investigations into scientists and researchers who are suspected of passing information to China.
In separate letters to FBI Director Christopher Wray and NIH Director Francis Collins, the lawmakers said they are concerned that ethnically Chinese scientists working in the U.S. are being racially profiled.
“There are certainly authentic and legitimate cases of espionage that should be investigated,” the lawmakers wrote to Wray. “However, according to news reports, the FBI has arrested and charged many Chinese-American scientists who have turned out to be innocent.”
“These reports have created serious concern that innocent people are being swept up in this initiative,” the letter to Collins said. “The current moves have been characterized as ‘racial profiling’ and a ‘new Red Scare.’”
The lawmakers pointed to a number of cases against Chinese Americans who were acquitted or had the charges against them dropped.
“One study found that 52% of individuals charged under the Economic Espionage Act since 2009 have been of Chinese heritage,” they wrote. “But those defendants are more than twice as likely to be acquitted, or have all charges against them dropped, compared to defendants with non-Chinese names, suggesting that many individuals of Chinese heritage who were swept up in the FBI’s counterintelligence efforts were innocent and falsely accused.”
The New York Times reported in November that the FBI and the NIH are trying to root out scientists suspected of stealing biomedical research for other countries. Nearly all the incidents under investigation involved scientists of Chinese descent.
The number of arrests related to Chinese espionage cases has risen dramatically in recent years, according to U.S. officials. There were 24 arrests in the last fiscal year, an increase from 15 arrests five years earlier. There have already been 19 arrests this fiscal year, according to Justice Department statistics presented at a conference on Chinese economic espionage in early February.
Last month, Charles Lieber, chairman of Harvard University’s chemistry department and who does not have Chinese heritage, was charged with lying to the U.S. government about his alleged connections to China. He is accused of making false statements to the Defense Department and the NIH about his participation in China’s Thousand Talents Program, according to the criminal complaint.
The Thousand Talents Program is a Chinese government-run program that seeks to recruit Chinese and foreign academics and entrepreneurs to work in science and technology fields in China.
Chinese researcher Zaosong Zheng was arrested in December after allegedly trying to smuggle vials of cancer cells out of the U.S. Authorities alleged Zheng stole the vials from a laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Another Chinese national, Yanqing Ye, who was a researcher at Boston University, was accused of lying to authorities about her status as a lieutenant in the People’s Liberation Army.
The Justice Department began the China Initiative in 2018 to combat the espionage threat, sparking fears among researchers and students, whom China often uses to steal secrets from the U.S.
“To be clear, this is not about the Chinese people as a whole, and it sure as heck isn’t about Chinese Americans as a group,” Wray said at Chinese economic espionage conference in early February, "but it is about the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party.”
The concerns about racial profiling are not unwarranted. A book published earlier this month, The Scientist and the Spy, said the FBI began collecting information on Chinese scientists and students across the U.S. at the height of the Cold War.
In 1967, FBI agents were ordered "to cull names of ethnically Chinese researchers including, implicitly, U.S. citizens from the membership records of scientific organizations," according to the book.

Texto completo: The deputy national security adviser is being reassigned to another role in the Trump administration despite White House denials of speculation that she’s the unknown official who wrote a New York Times op-ed and book critical of President Trump.
Victoria Coates will be a senior adviser to Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, the National Security Council announced Thursday, according to Axios.
Coates and the author’s agents have both denied she is “Anonymous,” the author of the tell-all book, A Warning. The White House is also pushing back on the rumor.
"The White House leadership rejects rumors that have circulated recently and does not put any stock in the suggestion that Victoria Coates is the author of A Warning or the related op-ed in the New York Times,” a senior administration official told Axios.
"Dr. Coates’ transition to the Department of Energy has been in the works for several weeks and reflects the continued trust and confidence the administration places in her as she takes on this sensitive role at the Department of Energy, where she will continue working to implement the president’s agenda," the official added.
National security adviser Robert O’Brien said he was sad to lose Coates but added that she would be a “big asset” to the Energy Department.
“She has served the president loyally since the earliest days of the administration and has played a valued role in the president’s Middle East policy,” O’Brien said.

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump on Wednesday named Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany who quickly antagonized the establishment after arriving in Berlin in 2018, to be the acting director of national intelligence overseeing the nation’s 17 spy agencies.
By choosing Grenell, who has little experience in intelligence or in running a large bureaucracy, the president signaled that he wants a trusted, aggressive leader atop an intelligence community that he has long viewed with suspicion and at times gone to war against.
As ambassador, Grenell made public statements that some German officials took as expressing opposition to the government there, an extraordinary intervention into domestic affairs that diplomats typically avoid. He attacked what he called “failed” open-border policies in Germany, which has resettled hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, and criticized Berlin’s stances on Iran, military spending and Chinese investment in global telephone networks. He also expressed an eagerness to empower conservatives throughout Europe.
“I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders,” Grenell told Breitbart, a far-right website, in an interview shortly after his arrival in Germany. “I think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the left.”

While intelligence directors have tried to serve as neutral arbiters of facts, Grenell’s experience as an ideological advocate prompted some former officials to express concern that he could color the intelligence he presents to Trump rather than present an objective assessment.
“This is a job requiring leadership, management, substance and secrecy,” said John Sipher, a former CIA officer. “He doesn’t have the kind of background and experience we would expect for such a critical position.”
Grenell is expected to keep his current ambassadorship as long as he is acting intelligence director, one administration official said. Grenell did not respond to a request for comment.
His bare-knuckled approach clearly resonates with the president and his inner circle. Last spring, shortly before the now-infamous removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, the president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., invoked Grenell in a tweet about conservative discontent with Yovanovitch. “We need more @RichardGrenell’s and less of these jokers as ambassadors,” the younger Trump wrote.
Grenell, who has pushed to advance gay rights in his current post, is also thought to be the first openly gay Cabinet member.
Republican senators had privately pushed the administration to nominate a national security professional for the post, and advisers made clear that the president was not nominating Grenell for the permanent job. Trump has installed acting leaders in other top government vacancies, giving him freedom to maneuver around the demands of Senate confirmation.
By law, the current acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has to give up his temporary role before March 12. Grenell is expected to begin his new job Thursday.
Maguire has served as acting director of national intelligence since the resignation last summer of Dan Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana.
Grenell would be the latest in a line of intelligence directors who have had varied policy experience including diplomatic or military backgrounds rather than stints in the intelligence world. But Grenell is also an acerbic combatant who throws regular punches at “fake news” reporters and Trump’s opponents online.
Last month, he angrily demanded The Washington Post retract a report, which he insisted was based on fabricated sources, that Trump had threatened to impose auto tariffs on European cars if European leaders did not adopt a tougher line on Iran’s nuclear program. The next day, Germany’s defense minister publicly confirmed the report.
Grenell honed his combative style when he worked as a spokesman at the United Nations for former ambassador John Bolton. Often to the surprise — and sometimes the horror — of the State Department’s more staid communications officials who worked for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Grenell would take on reporters and argue long into the night about stories appearing in major newspapers and on television.
In recent days, after Attorney General William Barr said in an interview that Trump’s tweets made his job more difficult, Grenell appeared on Fox News to counter that view. “It makes my job so much easier,” Grenell said, offering the example of Trump’s pressure on NATO allies to spend more on defense.
In a country where former President Barack Obama is still widely popular, Grenell’s style put off other officials and ultimately isolated him, the German publication Der Spiegel reported last year. “The powerful avoid him,” the newsmagazine wrote. “Doors have been shut.”
Much of Grenell’s criticism has been directed at German military spending, its decision to stand behind the nuclear deal with Iran, and its wavering on the American demand to ban Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, from building next-generation mobile networks.
He has also had successes, including getting Germany to agree to take American liquefied natural gas and to pull the landing rights of an Iranian airline. A number of German companies have pulled out of Iran, warned by Grenell that they could run afoul of U.S. sanctions if they did business with Tehran.
And while German military spending has continued to rise during the Trump administration, the government in Berlin has ratcheted back its goals for increasing spending.
While most of the previous directors of national intelligence have tried to take a nonpartisan tone, Trump has looked askance at officials who have tried to remain neutral. He has increasingly looked to people for positions who he believes share his views.
“Grenell, from the beginning, was an ultraright-wing sniper on social media,” said Douglas H. Wise, a former senior intelligence official. “He is certainly in line with the Trump agenda.”
Intelligence professionals reacted with surprise, and some with disappointment, questioning Grenell’s experience and temperament. The appointment demonstrated that Trump little understands or values the intelligence community, said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, former head of the National Counterterrorism Center.
“Personal loyalty is prized above relevant experience and demonstrated competence,” said Rasmussen, now acting executive director of the McCain Institute. “Professionalism and integrity are devalued. The signal this sends to our career national security and intelligence professionals is unmistakable.”
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Trump for appointing another acting director, rather than choosing an official nominee, “apparently in an effort to side step the Senate’s constitutional authority.”
While it has never been clear how Trump viewed Maguire, there is little doubt that the president would prefer a partisan fighter in the post. Maguire, a retired admiral, became acting director in August just as a whistleblower inside the CIA filed a complaint about Trump’s dealings with Ukraine.
Since even before the acquittal of Trump in the Senate impeachment trial, the president has been pushing to remove officials seen as disloyal to or undermining of the president or holding views contrary to the White House, looking for replacements who are more likely to follow the president’s wishes.
Trump has at times disparaged U.S. intelligence agencies because he did not agree with their findings, perhaps chiefly the conclusion that Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election to help him win. The president told his intelligence chiefs to “go back to school” after a congressional briefing during which they offered assessments on Iran and North Korea at odds with his policy initiatives.
Anxious to avoid a repeat, Maguire’s aides initially pushed for this year’s public hearing to be canceled, a request that lawmakers have rejected.
Tensions between the White House and intelligence agencies only grew during the impeachment inquiry. Maguire initially blocked the whistleblower complaint from being forwarded to Congress, following the guidance of administration lawyers. But he eventually helped broker the agreement to provide the complaint to Congress’ intelligence committees, allowing the impeachment inquiry to gain steam.
When Coats announced his resignation in July, Trump initially nominated an ally, Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, to be the next top intelligence chief, a job considered to be among the most nonpartisan in Washington. But Trump quickly dropped those plans after pushback from Democrats and some key Republicans who worried Ratcliffe’s loyalty to the president and lack of intelligence experience would make him nearly impossible to confirm. There were also concerns that Ratcliffe exaggerated his résumé.
After Ratcliffe was dropped from consideration, Trump promised to announce a new nominee soon. But the list of people with the requisite experience who have not been critical of the president is slim.
The administration considered, and discarded, a number of potential nominees including Pete Hoekstra, the U.S.ambassador to the Netherlands and a former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, a committee member.

Texto completo: Washington • Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Donald Trump reelected, five people familiar with the matter said, in a disclosure that angered Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.
The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant.
During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Trump’s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that Trump has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans.
That intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced Wednesday that he was replacing Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter.
Though some current and former officials speculated that the briefing may have played a role in the removal of Maguire, who had told people in recent days that he believed he would remain in the job, two administration officials said the timing was coincidental. Grenell had been in discussions with the administration about taking on new roles, they said, and Trump had never felt a personal kinship with Maguire.
Spokeswomen for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and its election security office declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A House intelligence committee official called the Feb. 13 briefing an important update about “the integrity of our upcoming elections” and said that members of both parties attended, including Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee.
The Washington Post first reported the Oval Office confrontation between Trump and Maguire.

Texto completo: The dean in charge of one of Weber State University’s larger divisions, the College of Arts and Humanities, is leaving for a job in Rome.
Scott Sprenger, dean of the college since 2016, is leaving the Ogden campus to become president of the American University of Rome, the school in Italy announced Thursday. He starts his new job on July 1.
Sprenger “had the demonstrated track record as an innovative, strategic leader, with the energy and vision that uniquely qualified him to lead us beyond our 50th anniversary,” Neil Boyden Tanner, acting chair of the American University’s board of trustees, said in a statement issued by the university.
Sprenger, in a statement, called the American University of Rome “one of the most progressive English-speaking liberal arts universities in Europe.”
“I have always advocated for the life and career-enhancing benefits of international higher education,” Sprenger continued, “and it is my fervent belief that all students who desire a truly inspirational, multicultural learning experience should have that opportunity — and where better than in Rome?”
Madonne Miner, provost at Weber State, said in a statement: “Scott Sprenger has provided enthusiastic and community-focused leadership. Under his direction the college has evolved and grown, adding associate degrees that provide opportunities for students to develop qualifications in very practical areas.”
In his job at Weber State, Sprenger oversees a college with more than 2,000 undergraduate majors and 200 graduate students, studying communication, English, foreign languages, performing arts, visual art and design.
Miner also credited Sprenger for his role bringing speakers and entertainers to Ogden for the Browning Presents series, including New York Times columnist David Brooks, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow and jazz vocalist Alicia Olatuja.
Weber State has not announced who will fill Sprenger’s position. A nationwide search launched at the beginning of the spring semester, Miner said, and WSU posted a job listing on a higher-education site in January.
Sprenger was hired away by Weber State from the American University of Paris, where he worked for two years. Before that, he was associate dean of the College of Humanities at Brigham Young University in Provo.
Sprenger’s wife, Anca Sprenger, is a professor of French and Italian at BYU. She will be moving to Rome with her husband, along with their 12-year-old beagle, Barney, the statement from American University said. Their daughter, Anna-Marie, is a Ph.D. student in linguistics at the University of Chicago.

Texto completo: The world's best-selling author of the past 20 years is coming to Camp Randall for UW-Madison's 2020 spring commencement.
James Patterson will address the graduates on May 9 as the spring commencement keynote speaker, according to a university announcement Wednesday. He will be joined by alumni speaker John Felder.
Patterson has 96 No. 1 titles on the New York Times Best Sellers List. He also made it to the Guinness Book of World Records as the first author to sell one million e-books.
Along with his wife, Susan, who has a bachelor's and master's degree in art from UW-Madison, Patterson has become an advocate for college affordability and youth literacy. The Pattersons provide financial support to more than 150 students annually through various scholarship funds.
Felder, a retired union administrator, was one of the primary organizers of the Black Student Strike at UW-Madison in 1969. The spring ceremony will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Department of Afro-American Studies, which was established as a result of the two-week strike involving black students and thousands of their allies.

Texto completo: El Ministerio de Salud de Japón confirmó este jueves la muerte de dos de las personas contagiadas por el coronavirus en un crucero puesto en cuarentena en ese país a principios de este mes, tras detectar un caso a bordo. Se trata de dos ancianos con nacionalidad japonesa.
Si, por un lado, algunos expertos han criticado la gestión de la cuarentena en esta situación, una buena noticia llega de Estados Unidos: la primera persona detectada con el virus en el país se recuperó completamente, según las autoridades sanitarias del condado de Snohomish, Washington, citadas por The New York Times.
Mientras tanto, China , el país epicentro de un brote infeccioso que generó una alerta global, ha modificado nuevamente la forma de calcular a contagiados y fallecidos por el virus: la semana pasada se empezaron a sumar los casos diagnosticados clínicamente, antes de las pruebas de laboratorio; ahora, en cambio, se restan los que resultan negativos tras esas pruebas.
Así, el número de nuevas infecciones y muertes reportadas este jueves ha sido más bajo que en días pasados: respectivamente, fueron 394 y 114, las cifras de aumento menores desde que saltaron las alertas internacionales por el brote del virus, apunta la agencia de noticias AFP.
En Corea del Sur, el alcalde de Daegu, una urbe de 2.5 millones de habitantes, pidió a los ciudadanos que no salgan de sus casas debido al aumento de casos positivos en esa zona. La mayoría de esos casos son de personas que asistieron a una función religiosa en una iglesia junto a una mujer anteriormente contagiada.
Primeros fallecidos entre los contagiados en el crucero
La televisión pública japonesa NHK dijo que ambas víctimas mortales del coronavirus y expasajeros del crucero Diamond Princess, aislado en el puerto de Yokohama desde hace más de dos semanas, tenían 87 y 84 años.
Un funcionario del Ministerio de Salud solo confirmó que habían sido hospitalizados previamente en estado grave y que tenían enfermedades crónicas existentes. El funcionario habló con la agencia de noticias The Associated Press bajo la condición de anonimato. En total, en Japón se confirmaron más de 700 casos de contagio y un fallecido, al que se suman ahora los dos ancianos que sufrieron la infección en el crucero.
Entre las 3,711 personas a bordo del barco se han detectado hasta el momento 621 casos confirmados. Algunos de los que dieron negativo ya pudieron bajarse de él este miércoles y se espera que otros lo hagan este jueves.
Algunos expertos han cuestionado la decisión del gobierno de Japón de mantener a los pasajeros en cuarentena en el barco, al considerarlo una incubadora perfecta para el virus. También se han criticado las medidas sanitarias aplicadas a bordo, que algunos médicos consideraron demasiado laxas.
Los repatriados estadounidenses en el barco
Estados Unidos repatrió a más de 300 ciudadanos, entre pasajeros y miembros de la tripulación, que se habían quedado bloqueados en el crucero. Tras regresar, estos estadounidenses fueron puestos en régimen de cuarentena durante 14 días.
Al menos 44 dieron positivo con el virus, según Anthony Fauci, director del Instituto Nacional de Alergias y Enfermedades Infecciosas . Fauci agregó que se espera que los casos confirmados aumenten cuando se completen las pruebas de laboratorio.
Mientras tanto, el hombre de 35 años detectado con el virus en enero, al regresar al estado de Washington tras visitar Wuhan, la ciudad china considerada epicentro del brote internacional, se recuperó y puede volver a hacer vida normal, de acuerdo con The New York Times.
Desde su alta del hospital hace unas tres semanas, el hombre se ha quedado en casa, aislado, a pedido de los funcionarios de salud locales. Pero después de consultar con funcionarios estatales y federa les, el Distrito de Salud de Snohomish concluyó que se podían levantar todas las restricciones impuestas en su caso. El hombre recibió un tratamiento antiviral experimental.
China confunde otra vez a los expertos
El nuevo cambio de método de cálculo de contagios y muertos por el coronavirus en China genera confusión entre los expertos de salud pública, ya que hace alterar las cifras de nuevos casos y dificulta la percepción de si el brote está en expansión o está siendo contenido.
Ahora, explica el Times, las autoridades de la provincia de Hubei, el área donde se detectaron la gran mayoría de casos, han vuelto a considerar confirmados solo los contagios detectados a través de pruebas de laboratorio, que son difíciles de realizar, pueden tardar días en realizarse y a veces fallan.
La Comisión Nacional de Salud explicó que esta actualización se debe a que algunos pacientes, inicialmente contados como “confirmados” debido a simples radiografías de tórax, fueron sometidos a un test de detección que reveló que no habían contraído la enfermedad, llamada oficialmente COVID-19.
“Para un epidemiólogo, es realmente frustrante cuando las definiciones de casos siguen cambiando”, dijo a este periódico, Benjamin Cowling, profesor de epidemiología en la Universidad de Hong Kong. “¿Por qué no pueden resolver cuál es un caso probable, sospechoso y confirmado? Es totalmente confuso”, agregó.
En total, en China continental se registraron hasta el momento 2,118 muertos y casi 75,000 casos de contagio. En este país siguen en marcha varias medidas altamente restrictivas para intentar contener el brote, como cuarentenas para decenas de millones de personas.
En Wuhan, inspectores vestidos con trajes protectores recorrieron el miércoles la ciudad casa por casa para intentar localizar a todas las personas infectadas.
Emergencia en Corea del Sur
Hubo también otras 10 muertes en otros países: entre las últimas, dos se produjeron en Irán y una en Corea del Sur.
Allí, las autoridades están preocupadas por la rápida expansión del virus en la zona de Daegu. El alcalde de la ciudad, Kwon Young-jin, al anunciar la cuarentena para los 2,5 millones de habitantes de la ciudad pidió que todos usen mascarillas protectoras incluso en ambientes interiores, si posible.
Asimismo, expresó sus temores de que las crecientes infecciones en la región pronto dificultarán el normal funcionamiento de las infraestructuras de salud de la ciudad y pidió ayuda urgente al Gobierno central.
El presidente, Moon Jae-in, le dijo por teléfono que el Ejecutivo proporcionaráa Daegu toda la asistencia posible.

NYT: Rusia está ayudando a la reelección de Trump en 2020

Texto completo: Funcionarios de inteligencia advirtieron a los legisladores de la Cámara la semana pasada que Rusia estaba interfiriendo en la campaña 2020 para tratar de reelegir al presidente Trump, dijeron cinco personas familiarizadas con el asunto a The New York Times, en un comunicado que enfureció a Trump, quien se quejó de que los demócratas lo usarían contra él.
Russia is aiding President Trump in the 2020 election, intelligence officials told lawmakers. Trump complained Democrats might exploit the news.https://t.co/Ej8lO5LJ9d
— The New York Times (@nytimes) February 20, 2020
El día después de la reunión informativa del 13 de febrero con los legisladores, Trump reprendió a Joseph Maguire, el director saliente interino de inteligencia nacional, por permitir que se conociera el comunicado por los legisladores, dijeron personas familiarizadas con el intercambio. Trump citó la presencia en la sesión informativa del Representante Adam B. Schiff, el demócrata de California que dirigió los procedimientos de juicio político en su contra, como un irritante particular.
Durante la sesión informativa para el Comité de Inteligencia de la Cámara, los aliados de Trump cuestionaron las conclusiones, argumentando que Trump ha sido duro con Rusia y ha fortalecido la seguridad europea. Algunos funcionarios de inteligencia vieron la sesión informativa como un error táctico, diciendo que si el funcionario que emitió la conclusión hubiera hablado de manera menos significativa o lo hubiera dejado de lado, habrían evitado enojar a los republicanos.
Ese funcionario de inteligencia, Shelby Pierson, es un ayudante del Sr. Maguire, quien tiene la reputación de brindar inteligencia en términos algo contundentes. El presidente anunció el miércoles que estaba reemplazando a Maguire con Richard Grenell, el embajador en Alemania y durante mucho tiempo un defensor agresivo de Trump.
Las voceras de la Oficina del Director de Inteligencia Nacional y su oficina de seguridad electoral declinaron hacer comentarios al NYT. Un portavoz de la Casa Blanca no respondió de inmediato a las solicitudes de comentarios de NYT tampoco.
Un funcionario del comité de inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes llamó al informe del 13 de febrero una actualización importante sobre “la integridad de nuestras próximas elecciones” y dijo que asistieron miembros de ambos partidos, incluido el representante Devin Nunes de California, el principal republicano en el comité.
The Washington Post informó por primera vez sobre la confrontación de la Oficina Oval entre Trump y Maguire.
Esta es una historia en desarrollo, indica NYT, que será actualizada por ese medio posteriormente.

“Trabajé muy duro para ser multimillonario”: ex alcalde Bloomberg falló en su primer debate Demócrata

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg no tuvo un exitoso debut anoche en Las Vegas, donde obviamente fue el centro de las atenciones y los ataques en su primera oportunidad de debatir en las primarias Demócratas.
Desde el comienzo, los Demócratas “desataron un agresivo ataque verbal al multimillonario de Nueva York Mike Bloomberg y plantearon nuevas preguntas sobre la política de Bernie Sanders”, resumió Pix11.
Bloomberg defendió su riqueza y dijo que trabajó muy duro para convertirse en multimillonario, pero que también ha tenido mucha suerte.
El moderador de debates de NBC, Chuck Todd, le preguntó a Bloomberg si debería haber ganado tanto dinero, y el empresario respondió diciendo: “Sí, trabajé muy duro por ello”.
Según analistas de The New York Times, Bloomberg fue de lejos el peor de los seis pre candidatos participantes en el noveno debate, que fue apenas el primero para él. El diario calificó su desempeño de apenas 2.9/10; colocando a la senadora Elizabeth Warren a la cabeza, con 8.4/10.
Los otros fueron ubicados en orden descendiente: el senador Sanders 7.2/10; el ex alcalde Pete Buttigieg 6.9/10; el ex vicepresidente Joe Biden 6.2/10, y la senadora Amy Klobuchar 6/10.
En comparación, algunos expertos citaron que el mal desempeño de Donald Trump en los debates de 2016 no le impidió llegar a la Casa Blanca; y que el mismo Bloomberg tuvo problemas al debatir en su ruta a la alcaldía de Nueva York, y al final ejerció el cargo por tres períodos (2002-2013).
“No está avergonzado de lo que es, por desagradable que pueda ser para otros Demócratas, particularmente en lo que respecta a su riqueza y su fea historia con mujeres y minorías . Su falta de defensa podría permitirle abrirse paso a través de las primarias como lo hizo Trump en el partido Republicano”, comentó Daniel McCarthy.
“Bloomberg no es un candidato líder, sólo interpreta uno en los anuncios de televisión. Cuando no estaba recibiendo golpes, era invisible. Sus respuestas sobre el racismo y el sexismo fueron horribles. El dinero no puede comprar carisma o humildad. Históricamente mal desempeño en el debate”, resumió el analista Gil Durán.
Según NY1 News, Bloomberg ya ha gastado más de $300 millones de dólares de su propio dinero hasta el momento, pero no aparecerá en ninguna boleta hasta las competencias del Súper Martes el 3 de marzo.
Luego de ser Demócrata, fue elegido para tres mandatos como alcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York: como republicano en 2001 y 2005, y una vez como independiente en la línea republicana en 2009. En 2018 se reinscribió en el partido Demócrata.

Texto completo: Funcionarios de inteligencia advirtieron a los legisladores de la Cámara la semana pasada que Rusia estaba interfiriendo en la campaña 2020 para tratar de reelegir al presidente Trump, dijeron cinco personas familiarizadas con el asunto a The New York Times, en un comunicado que enfureció a Trump, quien se quejó de que los demócratas lo usarían contra él.

— The New York Times (@nytimes) February 20, 2020
El día después de la reunión informativa del 13 de febrero con los legisladores, Trump reprendió a Joseph Maguire, el director saliente interino de inteligencia nacional, por permitir que se conociera el comunicado por los legisladores, dijeron personas familiarizadas con el intercambio. Trump citó la presencia en la sesión informativa del Representante Adam B. Schiff, el demócrata de California que dirigió los procedimientos de juicio político en su contra, como un irritante particular.
Durante la sesión informativa para el Comité de Inteligencia de la Cámara, los aliados de Trump cuestionaron las conclusiones, argumentando que Trump ha sido duro con Rusia y ha fortalecido la seguridad europea. Algunos funcionarios de inteligencia vieron la sesión informativa como un error táctico, diciendo que si el funcionario que emitió la conclusión hubiera hablado de manera menos significativa o lo hubiera dejado de lado, habrían evitado enojar a los republicanos.
Ese funcionario de inteligencia, Shelby Pierson, es un ayudante del Sr. Maguire, quien tiene la reputación de brindar inteligencia en términos algo contundentes. El presidente anunció el miércoles que estaba reemplazando a Maguire con Richard Grenell, el embajador en Alemania y durante mucho tiempo un defensor agresivo de Trump.
Las voceras de la Oficina del Director de Inteligencia Nacional y su oficina de seguridad electoral declinaron hacer comentarios al NYT. Un portavoz de la Casa Blanca no respondió de inmediato a las solicitudes de comentarios de NYT tampoco.
Un funcionario del comité de inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes llamó al informe del 13 de febrero una actualización importante sobre “la integridad de nuestras próximas elecciones” y dijo que asistieron miembros de ambos partidos, incluido el representante Devin Nunes de California, el principal republicano en el comité.
The Washington Post informó por primera vez sobre la confrontación de la Oficina Oval entre Trump y Maguire.

Raven Short Play Festival features 15 plays, each 10 minutes long

Texto completo: Last fall, when the leaders of the Raven Players theater company invited playwrights across the country to submit original, unpublished scripts for the theater’s first short play festival, they rather underestimated the response.
“We were hoping to get 50 to 100 submissions,” said Steven Martin, the company’s artistic director. “We got well over 800, and that was great, but then we had to read them all.”
It took more than two dozen volunteer play readers and multiple rounds of voting to pare down the mountain of scripts to the 15 plays that will be presented this month at the Raven Performing Arts Theater during the festival, titled and themed “Love Bites,” in honor of St. Valentine’s Day and because each show is bite-sized, running 10-12 minutes.
“I expected more vampire plays with that theme, but we did get one,” Martin said. “It’s about a vampire who has an issue with his teeth and has to see a dentist.”
The winning plays have been divided into groups — eight in one and seven in the other — with each group getting two performances during the four-day festival. Five directors, each handling three shows, and 15 actors in multiple roles, all from the North Bay, will put on the plays.
“Each night, you’re going to be in the theater for an hour and 45 minutes, with an intermission. You’re seeing 10-minute plays, so if you don’t like one, you’ll see another one in 10 minutes,” Martin said. “There’s a good variety and it’s a challenge for the actors.”
The plays range in tone from comic to tragic and scope from intimate and observational to broader and more philosophical.
“These shows run the gamut. We didn’t want to have 15 plays that were all heavy or 15 balls of fluff,” Martin said, citing some specific examples of the program’s variety:
“When Killer Animals Go Nuts” — “It’s about a guy who in real life talks like a voiceover in a movie trailer and goes out on a date.”
“Last and Always” — “This is about a gay couple during 9/11. One is in one of the twin towers, talking on the phone to his partner.”
“The Happy Place” — “A woman wants to scatter her late husband’s ashes at Disneyland because that was his happy place.”
“The Maltese Walter” — “It’s a takeoff on film noir.”
“All’s Fair in Love and Science” ­— “Two guys at a science fair watch their girls compete.”
The new event was conceived by Laurie Windham of Healdsburg, a playwright and author who served as chairwoman of the festival and made the final choice of plays, with Martin and Raven literary manager Tony Schiullo, after the field had been cut down to 50.
“I was reading an article in the New York Times about a short play festival off-Broadway, and it sounded cool,” she said. “There are so many fun new ideas about playwriting.”
Last fall, the Pegasus Theater Company, which has performed at various venues around the Russian River area since 1998, presented its 13th annual Tapas New Short Play Festival, drawing 75 play submissions from the greater Bay Area.
Taking a different direction, the Raven Players decided to reach out nationally, even internationally, on playwright websites, Windham said.
“I thought it would be good for our community to experience fresh ideas and perspectives from around the world,” she said. “I thought some insights from big cities could benefit Healdsburg.”
Only a couple of submissions came in from outside the country, and those weren’t chosen, but winning playwrights — each awarded $100 — come from across the United States, from New York to Florida to Illinois to Texas.
Martin of the Raven Players welcomed Windham’s project and has high hopes for the festival’s future.
“We’ve been focused on doing at least one new play each season,” he said. “Laurie came to us because she knew we were interested in new works. I hope the new festival does well, because I’d like to make it an annual event.”

Dos pasajeros de crucero Diamond Princess muertos por contagio con coronavirus de China

Texto completo: El Ministerio de Salud de Japón confirmó este jueves la muerte de dos de las personas contagiadas por el coronavirus en un crucero puesto en cuarentena en ese país a principios de este mes, tras detectar un caso a bordo. Se trata de dos ancianos con nacionalidad japonesa.
Si, por un lado, algunos expertos han criticado la gestión de la cuarentena en esta situación, una buena noticia llega de Estados Unidos: la primera persona detectada con el virus en el país se recuperó completamente, según las autoridades sanitarias del condado de Snohomish, Washington, citadas por The New York Times.
Mientras tanto, China , el país epicentro de un brote infeccioso que generó una alerta global, ha modificado nuevamente la forma de calcular a contagiados y fallecidos por el virus: la semana pasada se empezaron a sumar los casos diagnosticados clínicamente, antes de las pruebas de laboratorio; ahora, en cambio, se restan los que resultan negativos tras esas pruebas.
Así, el número de nuevas infecciones y muertes reportadas este jueves ha sido más bajo que en días pasados: respectivamente, fueron 394 y 114, las cifras de aumento menores desde que saltaron las alertas internacionales por el brote del virus, apunta la agencia de noticias AFP.
En Corea del Sur, el alcalde de Daegu, una urbe de 2.5 millones de habitantes, pidió a los ciudadanos que no salgan de sus casas debido al aumento de casos positivos en esa zona. La mayoría de esos casos son de personas que asistieron a una función religiosa en una iglesia junto a una mujer anteriormente contagiada.
Primeros fallecidos entre los contagiados en el crucero
La televisión pública japonesa NHK dijo que ambas víctimas mortales del coronavirus y expasajeros del crucero Diamond Princess, aislado en el puerto de Yokohama desde hace más de dos semanas, tenían 87 y 84 años.
Un funcionario del Ministerio de Salud solo confirmó que habían sido hospitalizados previamente en estado grave y que tenían enfermedades crónicas existentes. El funcionario habló con la agencia de noticias The Associated Press bajo la condición de anonimato. En total, en Japón se confirmaron más de 700 casos de contagio y un fallecido, al que se suman ahora los dos ancianos que sufrieron la infección en el crucero.
Entre las 3,711 personas a bordo del barco se han detectado hasta el momento 621 casos confirmados. Algunos de los que dieron negativo ya pudieron bajarse de él este miércoles y se espera que otros lo hagan este jueves.
Algunos expertos han cuestionado la decisión del gobierno de Japón de mantener a los pasajeros en cuarentena en el barco, al considerarlo una incubadora perfecta para el virus. También se han criticado las medidas sanitarias aplicadas a bordo, que algunos médicos consideraron demasiado laxas.
Los repatriados estadounidenses en el barco
Estados Unidos repatrió a más de 300 ciudadanos, entre pasajeros y miembros de la tripulación, que se habían quedado bloqueados en el crucero. Tras regresar, estos estadounidenses fueron puestos en régimen de cuarentena durante 14 días.
Al menos 44 dieron positivo con el virus, según Anthony Fauci, director del Instituto Nacional de Alergias y Enfermedades Infecciosas . Fauci agregó que se espera que los casos confirmados aumenten cuando se completen las pruebas de laboratorio.
Mientras tanto, el hombre de 35 años detectado con el virus en enero, al regresar al estado de Washington tras visitar Wuhan, la ciudad china considerada epicentro del brote internacional, se recuperó y puede volver a hacer vida normal, de acuerdo con The New York Times.
Desde su alta del hospital hace unas tres semanas, el hombre se ha quedado en casa, aislado, a pedido de los funcionarios de salud locales. Pero después de consultar con funcionarios estatales y federa les, el Distrito de Salud de Snohomish concluyó que se podían levantar todas las restricciones impuestas en su caso. El hombre recibió un tratamiento antiviral experimental.
China confunde otra vez a los expertos
El nuevo cambio de método de cálculo de contagios y muertos por el coronavirus en China genera confusión entre los expertos de salud pública, ya que hace alterar las cifras de nuevos casos y dificulta la percepción de si el brote está en expansión o está siendo contenido.
Ahora, explica el Times, las autoridades de la provincia de Hubei, el área donde se detectaron la gran mayoría de casos, han vuelto a considerar confirmados solo los contagios detectados a través de pruebas de laboratorio, que son difíciles de realizar, pueden tardar días en realizarse y a veces fallan.
La Comisión Nacional de Salud explicó que esta actualización se debe a que algunos pacientes, inicialmente contados como “confirmados” debido a simples radiografías de tórax, fueron sometidos a un test de detección que reveló que no habían contraído la enfermedad, llamada oficialmente COVID-19.
“Para un epidemiólogo, es realmente frustrante cuando las definiciones de casos siguen cambiando”, dijo a este periódico, Benjamin Cowling, profesor de epidemiología en la Universidad de Hong Kong. “¿Por qué no pueden resolver cuál es un caso probable, sospechoso y confirmado? Es totalmente confuso”, agregó.
En total, en China continental se registraron hasta el momento 2,118 muertos y casi 75,000 casos de contagio. En este país siguen en marcha varias medidas altamente restrictivas para intentar contener el brote, como cuarentenas para decenas de millones de personas.
En Wuhan, inspectores vestidos con trajes protectores recorrieron el miércoles la ciudad casa por casa para intentar localizar a todas las personas infectadas.
Emergencia en Corea del Sur
Hubo también otras 10 muertes en otros países: entre las últimas, dos se produjeron en Irán y una en Corea del Sur.
Allí, las autoridades están preocupadas por la rápida expansión del virus en la zona de Daegu. El alcalde de la ciudad, Kwon Young-jin, al anunciar la cuarentena para los 2,5 millones de habitantes de la ciudad pidió que todos usen mascarillas protectoras incluso en ambientes interiores, si posible.
Asimismo, expresó sus temores de que las crecientes infecciones en la región pronto dificultarán el normal funcionamiento de las infraestructuras de salud de la ciudad y pidió ayuda urgente al Gobierno central.
El presidente, Moon Jae-in, le dijo por teléfono que el Ejecutivo proporcionaráa Daegu toda la asistencia posible.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg no tuvo un exitoso debut anoche en Las Vegas, donde obviamente fue el centro de las atenciones y los ataques en su primera oportunidad de debatir en las primarias Demócratas.
Desde el comienzo, los Demócratas “desataron un agresivo ataque verbal al multimillonario de Nueva York Mike Bloomberg y plantearon nuevas preguntas sobre la política de Bernie Sanders”, resumió Pix11.
Bloomberg defendió su riqueza y dijo que trabajó muy duro para convertirse en multimillonario, pero que también ha tenido mucha suerte.
El moderador de debates de NBC, Chuck Todd, le preguntó a Bloomberg si debería haber ganado tanto dinero, y el empresario respondió diciendo: “Sí, trabajé muy duro por ello”.
Según analistas de The New York Times, Bloomberg fue de lejos el peor de los seis pre candidatos participantes en el noveno debate, que fue apenas el primero para él. El diario calificó su desempeño de apenas 2.9/10; colocando a la senadora Elizabeth Warren a la cabeza, con 8.4/10.
Los otros fueron ubicados en orden descendiente: el senador Sanders 7.2/10; el ex alcalde Pete Buttigieg 6.9/10; el ex vicepresidente Joe Biden 6.2/10, y la senadora Amy Klobuchar 6/10.
En comparación, algunos expertos citaron que el mal desempeño de Donald Trump en los debates de 2016 no le impidió llegar a la Casa Blanca; y que el mismo Bloomberg tuvo problemas al debatir en su ruta a la alcaldía de Nueva York, y al final ejerció el cargo por tres períodos (2002-2013).
“No está avergonzado de lo que es, por desagradable que pueda ser para otros Demócratas, particularmente en lo que respecta a su riqueza y su fea historia con mujeres y minorías . Su falta de defensa podría permitirle abrirse paso a través de las primarias como lo hizo Trump en el partido Republicano”, comentó Daniel McCarthy.
“Bloomberg no es un candidato líder, sólo interpreta uno en los anuncios de televisión. Cuando no estaba recibiendo golpes, era invisible. Sus respuestas sobre el racismo y el sexismo fueron horribles. El dinero no puede comprar carisma o humildad. Históricamente mal desempeño en el debate”, resumió el analista Gil Durán.
Según NY1 News, Bloomberg ya ha gastado más de $300 millones de dólares de su propio dinero hasta el momento, pero no aparecerá en ninguna boleta hasta las competencias del Súper Martes el 3 de marzo.
Luego de ser Demócrata, fue elegido para tres mandatos como alcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York: como republicano en 2001 y 2005, y una vez como independiente en la línea republicana en 2009. En 2018 se reinscribió en el partido Demócrata.
Más sobre el noveno debate Demócrata anoche en Nevada:
* Increpan a Biden por las millones de deportaciones ordenadas durante su vicepresidencia
* López Obrador se vuelve protagonista en el debate Demócrata en Las Vegas
* Duro derechazo de Elizabeth Warren a Bloomberg al inicio del debate Demócrata en Las Vegas

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Zoe Caldwell, a four-time Tony Award winner who brought humanity to larger-than-life characters, whether it be the dotty schoolteacher Miss Jean Brodie, an aging opera star Maria Callas or the betrayed, murderous Medea, has died. She was 86.
Her son Charlie Whitehead said Caldwell died peacefully Sunday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. Whitehead said her death was due to complications from Parkinson's disease.
The Australian-born actress played in regional theaters around the English-speaking world before becoming the toast of Broadway in 1968, and winning her second Tony, for "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie."
Among her other characters were Cleopatra, Saint Joan, Mother Courage and authors Colette and Lillian Hellman. As she matured, she accepted only roles that offer a particular challenge. If she thought, "Oh, I can do that," she didn't want to do them, she said in 1986.
Three of her four Tonys came in collaborations with her husband, Robert Whitehead, who was one of Broadway's most prolific producers of serious drama.
She cited his influence in her decision to do "Medea," the ancient Greek drama of a woman who is betrayed by her lover and kills their children in revenge. It won her a third Tony in 1982.
"Medea wasn't a character I believed in until my Robert started to talk to me about her in human terms," she told The New York Times a few days after the Tony ceremony. "I suddenly understood how a creative force of nature can become destructive if it is mucked up, polluted, depurified - like the atom."
Times critic Frank Rich cited the flashes of sensuality - which she said derived from the study of Greek painting and sculpture - and wit that she brought to the character.
"When, at last, the crime is at hand, the actress fully dramatizes the struggle between her hunger for revenge and her love of her sons," Rich wrote. "Like the gods, we can understand, if not pardon, the primal impulse that drives her to the ultimate act of annihilation."
Terrence McNally's "Master Class," which debuted on Broadway in 1995, was another joint effort with Whitehead. It won Caldwell her fourth Tony and brought Whitehead, as producer, the Tony for best play.
She played Callas as the opera superstar critiques, cajoles and inspires a trio of budding singers taking part in the uniquely intense musical education session called a master class.
"A performance is a struggle. You have to win," she says as Callas.
Then-Associated Press drama critic Michael Kuchwara called Caldwell "incandescent" and said she gave "the performance of her career."
Already well-known to those who followed regional theater, she had made her Broadway debut in "The Devils" in late 1965, temporarily replacing for Anne Bancroft, who injured her back.
Caldwell was quickly announced for a role as a society columnist in "Slapstick Tragedy," Tennessee Williams' pair of one-act plays. The production lasted less than a week on Broadway in February 1966 - but it brought Caldwell her first Tony, for best featured actress.
Broadway stardom arrived two years later for "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." The story of an eccentric Scottish schoolteacher with pro-fascist tendencies originated as a novel by Muriel Spark. The role had already been successful for Vanessa Redgrave in London and would eventually win an Oscar for Maggie Smith.
The Washington Post, noting others had played the role, said that "so masterfully exact is Miss Caldwell that watching her you will probably feel that hers is the only way (to play it). ... Almost at the instant we first see Miss Brodie, the actress has found a perfect mannerism."
The New York Times said Caldwell "flounces onto the stage like a sparrow with illusions of grandeur."
She and producer Whitehead married later that year. She told writer Rex Reed that far from pushing her into the Brodie role, Whitehead "wasn't keen on me for the part" until the playwright, Jay Presson Allen, campaigned for her.
Caldwell added Broadway directing to her resume starting in 1977 with a comedy, "An Almost Perfect Person," starring Colleen Dewhurst. In 1991, she directed Jason Robards and Judith Ivey in "Park Your Car in Harvard Yard." She was last on Broadway in 2003 as the Mystery Guest Star in "The Play What I Wrote." She also lent her voice to the "Lilo & Stitch" cartoons and appeared in the 2011 film "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close."
She spent much of her early career on the road.
After touring in a wide variety of plays in Australia, she came to England and got to tackle a succession of Shakespearean roles.
"I was always afraid of growing comfortable, so I would jump from job to job, whatever I was offered," she told The Associated Press in 1986. "I would go from Stratford-on-Avon to a small repertory company and back to London."
She traveled to Canada for parts at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. In the United States, she did regional theater work at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and the Goodman Theater in Chicago.
At that time, she said she didn't turn down any job.
"It was a heck of a long apprenticeship, but I would recommend it to any actress," she told The New York Times in 1968.
Caldwell was born in 1933 in Melbourne, Australia, to a family struggling to make it through the Depression. In her memoir, "I Will Be Cleopatra," she wrote that she knew at an early age that her job would be "keeping audiences awake and in their seats."
"I knew this because it was the only thing I could do," she wrote. Despite the family's tight budget, the Caldwells were regular theater-goers, she wrote, and "I saw every singer, dancer, actor, or vaudevillian who came to Melbourne."
She made her stage debut at age 9 in a Melbourne production of "Peter Pan."
Her husband died in 2002 at age 86, shortly after he had received a special Tony Award for his nearly 60-year career. Among his other honors were a best play Tony for "A Man for All Seasons" in 1962 and a best revival Tony for "Death of a Salesman" in 1984.
She and Whitehead had two sons, Sam and Charlie. In addition to her two sons, she is survived by two grandchildren.
"I always knew I would be an actor. I am an actor," she told the AP in 1986. "But being a wife and a mother still seems to me to be some kind of extraordinary stuff."

Food & Wine Experience
It's been 26 years since Minnesota Monthly started the Food & Wine Experience, and the gathering is still going strong. The main events are March 7-8, from 1-5 p.m. at Target Field.

Plan ahead
Among the many authors who will be part of Wordplay, a festival centered on books on May 9, will be Alison Roman, author of two cookbooks ("Dining In" and "Nothing Fancy"), who is a columnist for the New York Times. No indication yet what time she will be speaking, but tickets for the daylong event (with more authors than you can possibly hear) are $17 in advance and $20 at the door (those 17 and under are free). The event, which takes places from 10 a.m.-6 p.m., will be around the Minneapolis Mill City neighborhood. Tickets for the public will be available as of March 19. For more details, go to loft.org.
A hefty meal
There's a new food magazine in town.

Among the locally written articles are ones from Mecca Bos ("Black, Minnesotan, and Hungry for Identity") and James Norton ("The Sugar Demon"). The first issue is available online at meal-magazine.com.

Moralizing in Sin City

Texto completo: When I grew up in Malden, we thought Medford was pretty nice.
I mean, it was no Melrose, but it wasn't bad.
Tony Lucci's in Medford Square was arguably the best sporting goods shop in the world.
When Malden kids would say Lee Chisholm's was a really good store, too, guys from Medford would wave their hands dismissively and say, “Gettouttahere."
As the years went by, Medford seemed to get a little richer while Malden got a little poorer.
But nobody I know from Malden begrudges that. It's the next town over. Good for them.
Things change, and money changes everything.
Which is why it was pretty amusing to watch all the Democrats beat up Mike Bloomberg, of the Medford Bloombergs, for being too rich.
They did this, ironically enough, in Las Vegas, where, more than any other city in the world, your self-worth is measured exclusively by your monetary worth.
If they wanted to go after him on his enthusiastic embrace of patting down every Black guy in Brooklyn, or his habit of signing nondisclosure agreements with women, good luck to them. But trying to buy the election?
The spectacle of millionaire politicians chiding a billionaire politician is like getting hammered at Caesar's Palace on the free casino booze and telling the guy on the stool next to you that he might want to go easy on the sauce.
Bloomberg's self-funding his campaign is only slightly more ridiculous and offensive than the rest of them begging donors for money. Bernie Sanders holds himself out as the most honorable of them, because he takes money only from little people, not millionaires.
Given our electoral system, all politicians at the highest echelons are bought and sold, just at different levels.
Besides, disproportionately taking money from the little people is government policy. It's called taxes.
If all the Democratic candidates would sign a pledge saying they wouldn't take any political money from anybody and, furthermore, resolve that campaigns be shrunk down to a few weeks or months, as is done in every other sane democracy, then I might say they had a point. Otherwise, they're all just whistling past the graveyard, moralizing in Sin City.
If you're someone who thinks Donald Trump needs to be sent packing, watching the Democrats attack one another like 14-year-olds fighting over the remote was depressing indeed.
Whoever came up with that debate format, with the candidates raising their hands like schoolkids who had to go to the bathroom, must have a dark sense of humor or have gone to Catholic school. All night, the candidates sounded like tweens fighting to be heard at the cafeteria table.
We're told these debates are democracy, in real time.
Looks more like democracy in borrowed time, because if these clowns don't get their act together, say hello to four more years of Orange Chaos.
Many post-mortems scored the food fight squarely for Liz Warren. That's probably true, if you look at these debates as prize fights, where candidates score with verbal jabs and counterpunches.
Warren certainly got off the zinger of the night, referencing Bloomberg's reported inappropriate behavior by saying, “I'd like to talk about who we're running against: a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And, no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg."
Bada bing.
The debates, ostensibly, are meant to help voters figure out who is of presidential timber. You're supposed to see who you like more, but I came away from Wednesday's “debate" liking all the candidates less. Hard to say how this is playing in Peoria, though I'm guessing a lot of people in Peoria were watching the Blackhawks-Rangers game instead.
The polls say Sanders is leading what is still a crowded field. But it looked like most of the other candidates were more interested in bloodying Bloomberg than taking down the Bern.
Next time, it will be somebody else's turn. Because in the world of cannibalistic politics, the meal only ends when there is just one diner left.

Bloomberg bombs first debate test, raising questions about his viability

Texto completo: The reviews are in: Mike Bloomberg bombed.
Internet tricksters edited his Wikipedia entry and declared the former New York City mayor dead after Wednesday night's debate — “Cause of death: Senator Elizabeth Warren" — while more serious observers of the political scene found his first appearance onstage with his rivals stiff, at times stumbling, and generally underwhelming.
But was it fatal to his presidential aspirations? Sure, his entire candidacy rests on an argument that he alone can defeat President Trump, and he definitely didn't beat anyone in that debate. On the other hand, the media mogul, who is entirely self-financing his campaign, still has about $60 billion on his side.
“He can recover from it. I assume that he'll get better," said Bill Carrick, a veteran Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles. “His great strength is he's not going to suffer some fund-raising drought because of a bad performance. He'll just keep transferring money into his campaign account."
“He was just warming up," Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, said in a statement after the debate, spinning the attacks on his boss as a sign the three-term mayor is “a winner."
Note, dear reader, he did not say “ the winner."
Bloomberg's virgin voyage on the national presidential stage hasn't made his course to the nomination any smoother, and served to highlight his vulnerability on questions about his past remarks about women and his policies that affected people of color while he was mayor. The pummeling he took lacerated the sheen of electability he'd built around himself with his omnipresent ads, colossal campaign apparatus, and bottomless war chest.
Despite the debate's high TV ratings — averaging nearly 20 million total viewers across NBC and MSNBC and millions more online — several strategists said the candidates' two-hour tangle may not hurt Bloomberg's standing with voters in the states blitzed by his $400 million-and-counting worth of ads.
Outside of states like New Hampshire, where the majority of voters are very engaged, “it isn't clear [debates] can kill you because not enough people watch," said Matt Bennett, an executive with Third Way, a centrist think tank in Washington.
But Bloomberg's debate performance likely wounded the 78-year-old in the eyes of party elites, who had begun to view him as the potential moderate white knight to save the party from nominating Senator Bernie Sanders, said Brian Fallon, a former top aide to Hillary Clinton. Many establishment players worry that the self-described democratic socialist is too far left to win the general election against Trump, and their alarm has risen along with Sanders' poll numbers and delegate count.
Their backing could be crucial if the nomination ends up being decided at the convention if no single candidate amasses enough delegates to secure it outright, he said.
After former vice president Joe Biden's disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, those Democratic Party elites have been shopping for a more centrist figure to rally around, said Fallon. “In their imaginations they were starting to picture Bloomberg, and last night, I think, punctured that daydream."
It wasn't just Bloomberg's lackluster delivery. It was the blood drawn by rivals' attacks on him over his record on race and treatment of women that left him looking deeply vulnerable on key issues to Democratic voters, Fallon said.
Those blows included criticism over his previous support for stop-and-frisk policies that discriminated against Black and brown residents of New York City. On that and other predictable attacks, Bloomberg did not have a crisp response at the ready.
Also damaging was the broadside Warren launched over his alleged derogatory comments about women over the years. She also cornered Bloomberg with her request that he release women who used to work at his company from nondisclosure agreements signed as part of harassment and gender discrimination settlements. Bloomberg has not been accused of physically assaulting any women.
“None of them accuse me of doing anything other than, maybe they didn't like a joke I told," Bloomberg said, eliciting boos from the audience. He said he would not be releasing any of the former employees from the agreements.
Bloomberg's response “came eerily close" to Trump's dismissal of his infamous “Access Hollywood" tape comments as “locker room talk," said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. "He certainly didn't put himself apart from Donald Trump on issues of misogyny or understanding around sexual harassment."
Not surprisingly, Bloomberg's political rivals pounced on the newcomer's performance.
“Bloomberg had the worst debate performance in presidential debate history," the campaign of rival moderate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., declared in a memo Thursday. It suggested Bloomberg should drop out of the race so he doesn't risk preventing Buttigieg from stopping Sanders.
"I'll bet he's reaching in his pocket and spending $100 million more on advertising to try to erase everyone's memory of what happened last night," Warren said during an appearance Thursday on ABC's “The View."
Trump, whom Bloomberg has needled endlessly since getting into the race in November, gleefully returned the favor Thursday. Quoting Bloomberg's statement from the debate that he doesn't think Sanders can beat Trump, the president told “Mini" Bloomberg via Twitter that “there's even less chance, especially after watching your debate performance last night, of you winning the Democrat nomination . . . But I hope you do!"
Carrick, the California strategist, said Bloomberg had fallen victim to the same Achilles' heel that plagues all self-funded wealthy candidates. Bloomberg built up an advertising-driven image — then the reality didn't match the polished candidate from the ads, he said. "It raises questions right off the bat."
Nonetheless, Bloomberg and his immense campaign stuck to the script Thursday. He smacked back at Trump on Twitter. He campaigned in Utah, which votes with 13 other states on March 3, Super Tuesday. His campaign rolled out more endorsements, and filed a breathtaking report with the Federal Election Commission that showed, among other things, that he has spent more than $400 million of his own fortune on his campaign so far, including a whopping $220 million just in January.
But even the bajillion-dollar spin machine at Bloomberg's back could not frame his first debate as any sort of victory.
“So how was your night last night?" Bloomberg cheekily asked the crowd at his Utah event Thursday. Then he launched into an attack against Sanders sharper than he delivered the night before. “Look, the real winner of the debate last night was Donald Trump. Because I worry that we may be on the way to nominating someone who cannot win in November. If we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base — like Senator Sanders — it will be a fatal error."

Texto completo: The White House's deputy national security adviser, Victoria Coates, will move to the Energy Department after battling rumors among some of President Trump's supporters that she is the author and Trump critic "Anonymous."
A senior administration official said the move has been in the works for several weeks and that the White House does not believe Coates is the author of the book "A Warning" or a 2018 op-ed in the New York Times that described Trump officials who sought to "thwart parts of his agenda."
The publisher of "A Warning" has publicly denied that Coates is the author of the book. The White House National Security Council said Thursday that Coates will become a senior adviser to Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette. She starts her new position on Monday.
"While I'm sad to lose an important member of our team, Victoria will be a big asset to Secretary Brouillette as he executes the president's energy security policy priorities," national security advisor Robert O'Brien said in a statement. "She has served the president loyally since the earliest days of the administration and has played a valued role in the president's Middle East policy."
Axios reported Coates's move earlier on Thursday.
Coates is the latest departure from the White House as Trump engages in retaliation against government officials he considers disloyal, following his acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial earlier this month. Last week, Trump recalled the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, and ordered the dismissal of two National Security Council aides, Alexander and Yevgeny Vindman.
Alexander Vindman testified in the impeachment inquiry that Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked for investigations of former president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, was "improper."
On Wednesday, Trump demanded and received the resignation of Pentagon Undersecretary for Policy John Rood. CNN reported earlier this month that Rood had warned Defense Secretary Mark Esper against cutting off US military aid to Ukraine after the White House blocked money Congress had appropriated for the country last summer, as Trump sought to pressure Ukraine's government to investigate political rivals.
Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he knows the identity of "Anonymous," but refused to publicly name the official.
"It's not so much a search. I know who it is," Trump told reporters when asked if there is an ongoing search for the author.
"People know it's a fraud," he added. "I know who it is, and I know who some of the leakers are."

US has plan to cut effects of farming on environment
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, whose department has been criticized for suppressing research on climate change, announced an initiative to reduce the environmental impact of American farming.
Perdue emphasized voluntary conservation incentives and efficiency improvements rather than regulation as he joins major farm groups in seeking to shape the public debate on agriculture and climate change. Twenty-one farm groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Pork Producers Council, announced a coalition Wednesday on environmental sustainability.
Climate change is gaining greater public attention after years of record-high global temperatures, rising sea levels, dramatic wildfires in California and Australia, and widespread spring floods last year that delayed planting in the Midwest. The issue of agriculture's role in climate change has surfaced in Democratic presidential primaries, with leading candidates calling for reductions in farming's carbon emissions through incentive payments.
Perdue has set a goal of increasing farm production by 40 percent while cutting the “environmental footprint" in half by 2050.
“We think that's attainable," he said in a speech Thursday. “It's a stretch goal. But we think we can get there."
The initiative includes goals such as a 50 percent reduction in food waste by 2030, a 30 percent cut in fertilizer runoff by 2050, and an overall “net reduction" in carbon emissions by 2050 “without regulatory overreach." A Department of Agriculture official declined to specify how the department would measure the environmental footprint.
The secretary also set a goal for biofuels such as ethanol to reach “market-driven blend rates" of 15 percent of US transportation fuels by 2030 and 30 percent of transportation fuels by 2050. Both would require policy action by the Environmental Protection Agency.
“We know we have a challenge facing us: to meet future food, fiber, fuel, and feed demands with finite resources," Perdue said at his department's annual Agricultural Outlook Forum.
Excerpts of the speech didn't make mention of climate change. The USDA inspector general announced an investigation in October, following criticism by Democratic lawmakers, into reports by Politico that the department suppressed research on the impact of climate change.
Agriculture was responsible for 9 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, according to the EPA.

New York Attorney General Letitia James demanded $810 million from New York City on Thursday, accusing the city's taxi regulator of playing a role in fraudulently inflating the value of taxi medallions.
In a formal legal claim sent to the city's comptroller, Ms. James said the city made hundreds of millions of dollars marketing and auctioning thousands of medallions while helping to keep values artificially high. A medallion is a metal shield that serves as the city's license to pick up street hails across the city.
When medallion values plunged to less than $200,000 from a high of more than $1 million several years ago, many medallion owners filed for bankruptcy. Many drivers still struggle today . There are about 13,500 such medallions in New York City.
A spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said his administration didn't play a role in the medallion crisis.
The spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said that since Mr. de Blasio took office, in 2014, the city had tried to help drivers and to curb the spread of ride-hailing competitors such as Uber Technologies Inc.
"This crisis has been ours to solve—working tirelessly to clean up the carelessness and greed of others," Ms. Goldstein said. "If the attorney general wants to launch a frivolous investigation into the very administration that has done nothing but work to improve the situation, this is what she'll find."
Ms. James gave notice that she would sue the city if it didn't meet her demands within 30 days. She said the funds would pay for restitution and damages to medallion owners.
City comptroller Scott Stringer said his office would review the attorney general's claims.
The attorney general launched an investigation following a series of articles in the New York Times last year charting how lenders, brokers and others in the taxi industry profited from the artificial inflation of medallion values.
Ms. James said that from at least 2004, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission set an artificial floor for prices and allowed brokers to inflate and collude on pricing. At the same time, she said, the regulator marketed medallions as a solid investment with returns better than the stock market.
Between 2004 and 2014, some medallion values more than tripled, Ms. James said. As early as 2011, she said, the regulator knew values were artificially high but failed to warn buyers.
Ms. James said the city made more money than it should have on medallion sales and transfers because of the artificially inflated prices.
Medallion values began to tumble in 2014 following an influx of tens of thousands of ride-hailing vehicles from companies such as Uber.
Earlier this week, an investment firm known for buying up distressed assets purchased thousands of medallions following the collapse of several credit unions that invested heavily in the licenses.

Some say men should get consent on video

Texto completo: COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Some attorneys say it can be the only way for people to defend themselves. Advocates say it falls woefully short.
In a #MeToo world, is written and recorded sexual consent the new norm?
Two Ohio State University football players, Amir I. Riep, 21, and Jahsen L. Wint, 21, were arrested Feb. 11 after being accused of raping and kidnapping a 19-year-old woman. The next day, head coach Ryan Day announced he had dismissed the two from the team.
Columbus police said in an affidavit that Riep told the victim to say the encounter was consensual on a video recording. That recording has been recovered, police said.
The idea of seeking "proof" of consent is concerning to sexual violence researchers and prevention advocates for a number of reasons. But some criminal defense attorneys say they encourage seeking consent in some sort of documented form, whether in writing or in an audio or video recording.
Brad Koffel, a Columbus criminal defense attorney in private practice for more than 25 years and managing partner of Koffel Brininger Nesbitt, advises his clients to obtain some sort of written consent for sexual acts, even if it's just a text message, and added that any sort of audio or video recording indicating consent is good, too.
"I think the best practice for young men is to ask for consent in writing," he said. "And if they don't, in this climate, then they're going to suffer some consequences."
A female attorney for Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who is standing trial for rape and sexual assault, made similar suggestions earlier this month.
"If I was a man in today's world, before I was engaging in sexual behavior with any woman today, I would ask them to sign a consent form," Weinstein's attorney Donna Rotunno said on The Daily, a New York Times podcast.
Although some attorneys view documented consent as a form of protection, Columbus criminal defense attorney Dan Sabol of Sabol Mallory said he would feel concerned if a client obtained written or recorded consent from a sexual partner.
"That'd be a red flag," he said. "It might look as though they're trying to cover their tracks."
Proof of consent might help someone who is falsely accused, Sabol said. But if there is compelling evidence that a sexual act was not consensual, he said the documentation of consent from a partner could increase the appearance of guilt in a suspect.
"Just because someone says it's consensual on video doesn't make it so," he said.
Brandon Shroy, a Columbus criminal defense attorney, said a jury is ultimately responsible for determining the validity of a consent video.
"It's something that defense attorneys - someone who is defending them - would love to see, but it's something a group of jurors would choose to believe or disbelieve," he said.
Sexual assault prevention advocates said they are seeing more instances of young people being advised to get "proof" of consent, but warn that formal documentation in writing or video doesn't capture how consent really works.
"It should be taken as a red flag that a person would have enough doubts about whether or not consent was established to ... request this type of agreement before or after an encounter," said Laura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. "Because in reality, one of the most important things for people to know about consent is that if you have any doubts, or not sure that you're on the same page with your partner, then the interaction should not move forward with your partner."
Emily Gemar, campus advocacy coordinator for OhioHealth's Sexual Assault Response Network of Central Ohio, said consent can legally be revoked at any time, so written or recorded documentation of consent is in no way representative of an entire sexual encounter.
"If someone consents on a recording one time, it doesn't simply (mean) blanket consent for everything after that," she said.

Spokane hospital created special unit following Ebola outbreak in 2014

Texto completo: Five patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus will be treated at Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center.
State and local health officials told The Spokesman-Review on Wednesday night they did not know where the patients were coming from or if they were local to the region.
"We want to reiterate that the risk to the public from COVID-19 remains low," the Washington State Department of Health said in a statement, using the official name of the illness caused by the novel coronavirus strain being treated. "Sacred Heart's Special Pathogens Unit is specially equipped to treat patients with infectious diseases as well."
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asked Sacred Heart to treat five coronavirus patients because of its airborne infection isolation rooms, according to a statement from the the U.S. and Washington departments of health, the Spokane Regional Health District and Providence. The patients will be transported sometime in the next 48 hours, according to the statement.
"We are coordinating with local partners to safely transport these patients to Sacred Heart," Bob Lutz, Spokane County health officer with the Spokane Regional Health District, said in the statement. "This is all being done following our jointly developed infectious disease protocols that we train and prepare for."
More than 300 Americans previously quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan following a large COVID-19 outbreak on board returned to the U.S. earlier this week for a planned two-week quarantine at Travis Air Force Base in California, the New York Times reported. People who tested positive for the virus, including 14 in Japan and a few more who tested positive after reaching California, were to be transferred to local hospitals for care.
The first U.S. case of the novel coronavirus was confirmed in Snohomish County last month. The man had recently traveled through Wuhan, China, the region identified as the epicenter for the virus, and began presenting symptoms the day after he got back from a trip to visit family. He has since been treated and discharged from a Seattle-area hospital.
Washington state health officials used an unapproved antiviral drug developed to treat Ebola to treat that first U.S. novel coronavirus patient. The patient's condition improved and staff discontinued supplemental oxygen by the eighth day.
Nearly 30 countries had confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the Centers for Disease Control. More than 75,000 people have been infected worldwide, and more than 2,100 have died.
In the U.S., 479 people in 42 states - not including people who came from quarantine in Japan - had been investigated for infection with the novel coronavirus as of Wednesday, according to the CDC. Fifteen people have tested positive so far, with results for 52 pending.
Sacred Heart began preparing to treat infectious diseases like COVID-19 following a 2014 Ebola outbreak, when the the federal health department chose the hospital and 9 others to host regional special pathogens units for people with highly infectious diseases. Sacred Heart was designated for people in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska, and it received $2.1 million from Congress to build the unit, train staff and run ongoing drills.
The arrival of the COVID-19 patients is not expected to affect hospital operations, a news release said.
The 14,000-square-foot infectious disease unit requires an ID badge to enter and has negative airflow to keep disease from spreading outside. It was equipped to handle up to 10 patients with infectious diseases. The unit was also built with a lab inside.
Jessica Baggett, a state Department of Health spokesperson, said the department was not aware of any new coronavirus patients being sent to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle or other Washington state facilities as of Wednesday night. Harborview, along with Sacred Heart, was among a handful of hospitals across the country that agreed to accept American Ebola patients in 2014.
Harborview spokesperson Susan Gregg said the hospital has not had any confirmed cases of COVID-19. Two people suspected of being infected with the novel coronavirus tested negative.
China's new virus cases, deaths rise, but increase has slowed
BEIJING - New virus cases in China rose by just 394 from the previous day, with a rise in the death toll of 114, the government said today, as health inspectors went door-to-door to find every infected person in the worst-hit city.
Mainland China has now reported 2,118 deaths and 74,576 total cases. While the overall spread of the virus has been slowing, the situation remains severe in Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan. More than 80% of the country's cases are in Hubei and 95% of the deaths, according to data from China's National Health Commission.
The new daily figure is a notable drop from the 1,749 cases recorded the previous day.
Inspectors in protective suits went door-to-door Wednesday in Wuhan to try to find every infected person. "This must be taken seriously," said Wang Zhonglin, the city's newly minted Communist Party secretary.
Chinese scientists reported some troubling findings about how the virus spreads. Swabs were taken on 14 people who returned to Guangdong province in January after visiting Wuhan and developing the disease. High amounts of the virus were detected soon after symptoms started, more in the nose than in the throat, and the virus was also found in one of their close contacts who never showed any symptoms.
That adds to concern about potential spread of the virus by people who may not know they're infected. The report from the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention was published by the New England Journal of Medicine.

L Brands to sell majority stake in Victoria's Secret for $1.1 billion

Texto completo: L Brands will sell its majority stake in lingerie brand Victoria's Secret to a private equity firm for $1. 1 billion.
The deal gives Sycamore Partners a 55% interest in Victoria’s Secret lingerie, Victoria’s Secret Beauty and Pink brands, the company said in a statement Thursday.
"We believe the separation of Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, Victoria’s Secret Beauty and PINK into a privately held company provides the best path to restoring these businesses to their historic levels of profitability and growth," said Leslie Wexner, chairman and CEO of L Brands, in a statement. "
When the transaction closes, Wexner will step down as chairman and CEO to assume the title chairman emeritus.
L Brands will control a 45% minority stake in Victoria's Secret, with Bath & Body Works remaining a standalone public company.
After dropping roughly 12% in pre-market trading, L Brands shares rebounded later in the morning to $24. 15 share, a dip of less than 1%.
Victoria's Secret, which generated about $7 billion in revenue last year, experienced a 10% decline in same-store sales during the fourth quarter and a 12% decline in same-store sales during this past holiday season.
The Victoria's Secret brand has faced additional troubles recently, including the cancellation of its annual fashion show. In early February, The New York Times detailed accusations of "misogyny, bullying and harassment" within the company. The report prompted a letter signed by more than 100 models to CEO John Mehas demanding that the lingerie company increase efforts to "protect the people they profit from. "
Meanwhile, Wexner has come under fire for his connection to financier Jeffrey Epstein, who served as his personal adviser. Wexner alleged in August that Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family. "
Retail analysts said the split will help L Brands focus on the better performing parts of its business.
"The separation of Victoria’s Secret into a private entity will enable L Brands to reduce debt and focus on its strong core business of Bath & Body Works, which represents over 80% of its operating income," Moody's vice president Christina Boni said in an investors note.
Victoria's Secret can also benefit from new ownership, says Neil Saunders, managing director of Global Data, a retail consultancy.
"Sycamore will be keen to maximize its investment and its closer involvement with the company will bring new thinking and ultimately a new positioning for the brand,'' Saunders said in an investors note. "We expect this to be more authentic, less sexualized, and more attuned to the way most consumers now think. ''

Texto completo: Tiffany Ruiz had tried various gyms, apps, workout routines and diets, all in an effort to get fit and lose some weight. "None of them worked because none of them kept my interest," she said.
Now, Ruiz is working out at least four times a week, thanks to a video game.
In her bedroom, she sprints, squats, stretches and performs other exercises like knee lifts and shoulder presses, all while battling a muscle-bound dragon and its toadies in "Ring Fit Adventure," a new game from Nintendo, the Japanese consumer tech giant.
"I am so focused on beating the high score or conquering an enemy that before I know it, 30 minutes have passed," said Ruiz, 26, who is studying to become a nursing assistant in Bakersfield, California.
"Ring Fit Adventure," created for the Nintendo Switch console, is the latest effort by the video game industry to try to entice consumers to get up off the couch and become more active.
Developers are folding fitness into games as part of a dual-pronged strategy: to retain players by offering a physical twist on traditional gameplay and to draw in new ones like Ruiz who are looking to break up the monotony of working out.
"Developers are trying to reach people who want fun and fitness at the same time," said Rik Eberhardt, a program manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Game Lab. "They know fitness is good for them, but it can feel like a chore in their busy lives."
Fitness games make up just 1% of the market, but the overall industry is steadily growing. Sales of games across all platforms generated $35.4 billion in the United States last year, up 2% from 2018, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.
"Exergaming," a portmanteau of exercise and gaming, has been around since the late 1980s, when Bandai introduced Power Pad, a gray mat with pressure sensors, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Games now use motion sensors, smartwatches and even virtual reality to track a player's movement.
Some games disguise fitness routines in the form of role-playing, dancing or other activities like running from zombies. Others are fitness and health apps that lead users through workouts with scoreboards, real-time feedback and multiplayer options. Nintendo's Wii game console brought exergaming into the mainstream in 2006. Its "Wii Fit" game incorporated a balance board so players burned calories through calisthenics and yoga.
"The Wii had the fastest adoption rate in the U.S. of any console in the first three years," Mat Piscatella, an industry analyst for NPD, said. "Wii Fit" remains one of the bestselling games in the United States, according to NPD.
Nintendo's two main competitors, Microsoft and Sony, followed its lead, adding motion-detecting cameras to their consoles. Games like "Just Dance" and "Zumba Fitness: Join the Party," which were available on Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony consoles, were "breakout successes" in the motion era, Piscatella said.
Since then, the industry has been overturned by the rise of mobile devices, which allow games to be played on the go.
Exergames are not without risks, said Eefje Battel, a project manager at the Sports Innovation Campus at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Bruges, Belgium. One element missing in "Ring Fit," she said, is a coach to ensure that players are performing exercises correctly and safely.
"If you are squatting, the system will measure movement up and down, but it won't track posture," she said.

In Trump's world, the big shots get out early

Texto completo: Irving Kristol, a New York intellectual and youthful communist who became a guru of the American right, once defined a neoconservative as "a liberal who has been mugged by reality." Thanks to Donald Trump, we have a new definition of a criminal justice reformer: a rich person who is shocked to see his felonious friends punished as though they were poor.
Sorting out the motives behind the president's sudden slew of pardons for people he knows and likes is not terribly difficult. Trump is a monumental sleazeball who is comfortable with other sleazeballs, provided they are people of means and fame. It also helps if they are willing to play the role of toady, because Trump likes to see people grovel before him.
Rod Blagojevich gained his favor during their time together on Trump's reality TV show, "The Celebrity Apprentice." In dismissing him from the competition, Trump said, "Governor, I have great respect for you. I have great respect for your tenacity, for the fact that you just don't give up." Afterward, he made a point of saying how badly he felt for the guy who tried to sell a Senate seat.
In commuting Blagojevich's 14-year prison sentence, of which he has served nearly eight years, Trump lamented the heartless severity of the criminal justice system. "You have drug dealers that get not even 30 days, and they've killed 25 people," claimed the president, with his usual habit of making stuff up. "They put him in jail for 18 years, and he has many years left. And I think it's very unfair."
What Trump didn't mention is that the disgraced Illinois governor got off easy. After his 2011 conviction, prosecutors and the presiding judge agreed that the federal sentencing guidelines for his crimes, which mandated 360 months to life, were excessive. Judge James Zagel said a more reasonable range was 188 months to 235 months. He then imposed an even lighter sentence, 168 months.
It's safe to assume that Blagojevich strove to ingratiate himself with Trump during their TV time. If that weren't enough, his wife, Patti, went on Fox News repeatedly to praise Trump and plead for help, while heaping blame on Barack Obama and James Comey. She knew Trump's triggers.
Blagojevich was in appropriate company Tuesday. Trump also pardoned former New York City police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, who pleaded guilty to eight felonies, including tax fraud, got off with a four-year sentence instead of the 30 years he could have received, and was released after serving three years.
The dirty cop, who served under Trump henchman Rudy Giuliani, responded to Trump's decision with a maudlin lament: "Going to prison is like dying with your eyes open. Its aftermath of collateral consequences and the permanent loss of many of your civil and constitutional rights are personally devastating."
It's enough to break your heart. But the savage cruelty of incarceration never occurred to him when he was supervising a department that arrests hundreds of thousands of people every year so they can be prosecuted and imprisoned.
Trump also announced pardons for Michael Milken, a crooked Wall Street billionaire who did time for securities fraud, and former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr., convicted of failing to report a felony in a gambling industry scandal. The president has a remarkable capacity for mercy when it comes to people blessed with wealth or power who, like him, hold the law in contempt.
This is the same guy who in 1989 took out an ad in The New York Times demanding the restoration of the death penalty in New York and suggesting it would be appropriate for the Central Park Five. Never mind that rape was not a capital crime when the state had the death penalty. Never mind that the five, after serving time, were exonerated of the infamous attack.
Trump lusted for the harshest penalty, and he didn't agonize over whether it might be applied to the innocent. But then, the wrongly convicted boys, who ranged in age from 14 to 16, weren't wealthy, powerful, well connected, white or in a position to kiss Trump's feet.
Another rich, arrogant New Yorker, hotel magnate Leona Helmsley, who went to prison, was quoted by her housekeeper as saying, "We don't pay taxes; only the little people pay taxes." Under Trump, the little people pay the full price of their crimes, and the big people get a discount.

Who was Pop Smoke? 7 facts on late rapper

Texto completo: Pop Smoke's death early Wednesday in the Hollywood Hills shocked many in the rap community as well as devoted fans of the up-and-coming performer. But to others, the rapper born Bashar Barakah Jackson was an unknown quantity.
Here are a few facts about the "Welcome to the Party" mastermind, who was killed at age 20.
Pop Smoke was an up-and-coming star in Brooklyn's drill rap scene. His debut mixtape, "Meet the Woo," came out last July, and "Meet the Woo, Vol. 2" debuted this week in the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. "Dior" and a "Welcome to the Party" remix that featured Nicki Minaj both made it into the Top 50 on Billboard's list of hot R&B/hip-hop songs. "Gatti," which featured Pop Smoke along with Travis Scott, broke the top 35 on that chart last month.
He played the 2019 Rolling Loud festival in Los Angeles in December, along with Lil Uzi Vert and Playboi Carter. "What Rolling Loud, now in its third year as a traveling event, represents is the shock of the new: noise over order, charisma over lucidity, bad vibes over good," The Times' Mikael Wood wrote. "You saw it in 20-year-old Pop Smoke, rapping in his throaty bellow over a wobbling bass line that sounded close to collapse."
He was one of five rappers the NYPD asked Rolling Loud to lose from its New York lineup. Pop Smoke, 22Gz, Casanova, Sheff G and Don Q were called out in a police letter to organizers as being "affiliated with recent acts of violence citywide" and therefore, the letter claimed, likely to increase the risk of violence during the event, the New York Times reported in October. Organizers complied with that request.
Pop Smoke and his crew were aware that their lifestyle brought risks. "On the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway ... he and his crew engaged in what can only be described as defensive driving formations: rotating order, intermittently speeding up and slowing down, blocking other cars from their path," the New York Times wrote last fall. "It was the type of behavior exhibited by those who are mindful that something unexpectedly awful could happen at any moment."
He was about to go out on a monthslong international tour. Pop Smoke had a show set for March 21 at the Bottom Lounge in Chicago as part of a 40-plus-date tour that would have taken him across the U.S. Also on tap were shows in the U.K., Ireland, France, Belgium and Portugal.
He was free on $250,000 bail after being arrested last month in New York on suspicion of stealing a Rolls-Royce that he had borrowed overnight for a music video shoot in LA. Jackson was charged with a federal crime, interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, after he allegedly arranged for the car to be shipped cross-country on a flatbed truck. He had posted a shot of himself with the $375,000 car on social media. It was found parked in front of Jackson's mother's Brooklyn home with its plates changed and windows tinted. Previously he took part in a diversion program for first-time offenders, likely related to weapons possession.
Pop Smoke was killed Wednesday by masked gunmen in a Hollywood Hills home invasion. A person calling from the East Coast told authorities that several suspects had entered their friend's home shortly before 5 a.m. Police responding to the call found the 20-year-old rapper in the house with gunshot wounds. "The Bible tells us that jealousy is as cruel as the grave," Minaj wrote Wednesday on Instagram. "Unbelievable. Rest In Peace, Pop."

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump pardoned Michael Milken on Tuesday, it came just a week after the former junk bond king's Milken Institute had wrapped up its latest conference in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
The gathering featured a mix of high-powered leaders, including hedge-fund guru Ray Dalio and former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, but it wasn't just about how to make money or navigate the Washington, D.C., thicket. Reflecting the Santa Monica, Calif., institute's focus, the program of the 2020 Middle East and Africa Summit featured sessions on health, global diseases, education and the environment.
The event was only the latest manifestation of the 73-year-old's decadeslong commitment to philanthropy. It began before he pleaded guilty to felony violations of securities laws in 1990, but was ramped up in the years since in what became either an intentional or unintentional effort, depending on your view, to rehabilitate his image as the poster boy of 1980s greed.
In a tearful admission of guilt in a New York City federal courtroom, Milken pleaded in April 1990 to counts of conspiracy; aiding and abetting failure to meet federal securities disclosure regulations; securities fraud; aiding and abetting a regulated broker-dealer to violate securities reporting requirements; mail fraud; and assisting in filing a false tax return.
Milken was given a 10-year sentence, fined $200 million and required to pay $400 million in restitution. He later settled lawsuits for an additional $500 million. He served 22 months at a minimum-security prison dubbed "Club Fed" in Dublin, Calif., and was released after testifying against a former colleague. He also was banned for life from the securities industry.
Milken was among 11 felons who were either granted pardons or commutations of their sentences by Trump on Tuesday. Among the others was former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was serving a 14-year sentence for trying to sell an open U.S. Senate seat held by Barack Obama.
The president's decision follows a long campaign by Milken's supporters to win a pardon for him. In 2018, financier Anthony Scaramucci, who served briefly as Trump's communications director, told the Los Angeles Times that Los Angeles financier Gary Winnick, a former associate of Milken at now-defunct investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, had raised the issue at Trump's inauguration, citing his "commitment to health and global progress."
Other proponents of a Milken pardon at the time were said to include Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; and Rudy Giuliani, Trump's outside counsel.
It was Giuliani's investigation of Wall Street malfeasance in the 1980s, when he was a federal prosecutor, that led to Milken's guilty plea and imprisonment.
Through his pioneering use of junk bonds, Milken was credited with rescuing companies running low on cash or never had much to start with.
But critics accused him of enabling corporate raiders to plunder and gut viable corporations, laying off workers by the thousands.
The New York Times called Milken "the most powerful, most innovative, and most feared American financier since J.P. Morgan." He wasn't known for lavish living, but his $550 million salary and bonus in 1987 alone prompted outcries in newspaper editorials.
When Milken was sentenced in 1990, Richard Breeden, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, argued that the legendary trader "stood at the center of a network of manipulation, fraud, and deceit."
Milken, however, insisted that his work created many more jobs than it killed -- and that even some of those could have been saved if companies under threat of takeover had been more efficient.
Shortly after his release from prison in 1993, Milken was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer and given 18 months to live.
Surprising some of his doctors, he survived -- and started a foundation that channeled more than $700 million into prostate research. In 2004, Fortune magazine declared Milken "the man who changed medicine," pointing to the increased funding and visibility he had brought to the fight against prostate cancer.
Milken also founded the Milken Institute, a think tank that promotes capitalist solutions to global challenges. It annually brings together several thousand of the world's most successful people in business, government, entertainment, sports, arts and the sciences.

Texto completo: 'Amnesty'
By Aravind Adiga, Scribner, 256 pages, $26
Danny Rajaratnam, the protagonist of the bracing new novel by Aravind Adiga, "Amnesty," has a vegan girlfriend. She looks at him and says things like: "You know what milk is? A kind of pus. Think about that, you're guzzling pus."
Danny's days are already difficult. Born in Sri Lanka -- there, he was Dhananjaya, not Danny -- he came to Australia to study before being denied refugee status. He's an illegal, which to him makes it sound as if he's legal but sick.
Danny does feel a bit ill, every day. He's short and brown in a country that's tall and white. He's not bad-looking, but his teeth are cracked. He has golden highlights in his hair. Is there not a place for him here?
I like to read Adiga's novels almost as much as the poet James Dickey liked to drink. He has more to say than most novelists, and about 50 more ways to say it. Born in India, Adiga was educated at Columbia and Oxford. He won the Booker Prize for his novel "The White Tiger" (2008).
Adiga is a startlingly fine observer, and a complicator, in the manner of V.S. Naipaul. Danny wishes to belong in Australia, for example, but his views about other immigrants are tangled. His girlfriend listens to him. "My God!" she thinks. "Danny is a conservative."
Another illegal immigrant, a lovable and wily young man known as Abe, spies a policeman and recognizes "the look in his eyes: the look of a people losing their grip on a continent." Adiga is valuable because he attends to how people think, rather than how they should think.
No one in his novels is simple to understand. Adiga may not agree with everything that gets said or thought, but there is no gauze on his mental windshield. Nice people are often skewered, as if on kebabs. Reading him you get a sense of having your finger on the planet's pulse.
Danny works to fit in. He practices his posture. He rehearses his language skills: "Never say 'receipt' with the 'p.' Be generous with 'I reckon.' Add a loud 'Look'--at the start of the sentence, and 'ridiculous' at the end."
There are practices to avoid: "White people did not like the sound of knuckles being cracked." He hopes to understand the thing that, at times, baffles him the most: Australian irony.
Danny cleans houses and works in a grocery store. His life is a series of subaltern tasks. He lives in the grocery store, too, in the stockroom. When a regular customer says, "I've never seen you," Danny thinks: "Because I'm just the brown man working at the back of the store."
This novel has a simmering plot: One of Danny's former housecleaning clients is murdered. Danny thinks he knows who did it. The suspect knows Danny is in the country illegally. They have "kompromat" on one another. Perhaps they will each turn the other in, in a kind of mutually assured destruction pact.
Adiga's plot clicks the novel forward along its tracks, but it's packed with small implausibilities. You come to this novel for other reasons, notably for its author's authority, wit and feeling on the subject of immigrants' lives.
"Amnesty" has a lot to say about the desire to be seen. Sometimes, Adiga suggests, immigrants see one another all too plainly. "There is a buzz, a reflexive retinal buzz, whenever a man or woman born in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka or Bangladesh sees another from his or her part of the world in Sydney -- a tribal pinprick, an instinct always reciprocal, like the instantaneous recognition of homosexuals in a repressive society."
One of the novel's characters, the ostensible murderer, compares the plight of even legal people from India in Australia to certain sea creatures. This man says to Danny about the Great Barrier Reef:
"You've gone in the glass-bottomed boat to see all the corals, right? And what do you see? There's that filthy stingray, hiding squat on the ocean floor, and kicks up mud and it goes fleeing under the glass-bottomed boat with its forked tail, just the most frightened vermin you ever saw. I'm never going to live like that." A pungent expletive trots along behind these sentences.
This man's name is Prakash, and he alone is worth the price of admission. The contents of his character are alluring but suspicious, like the contents of Claude Rains' wine cellar in "Notorious."
For Prakash and his lover, ruinous gambling is part of their wellness routine. They compare themselves to Oscar and Lucinda, the title characters and gambling obsessives in Peter Carey's 1988 novel.
Adiga's observations about gamblers are perfect: "It was an odd vocation, this gambling, very technical, full of numbers, pencils and calculations, done by the kind of brawny men who did not seem to be otherwise into thoughtfulness or calculation." Everyone in this novel seems to be cashing in a shrinking pile of chips.
You can scoop Adiga's smaller observations up like shrimp in a net: "Even the smell of tobacco made a man more rational." "Anything can happen in Australia, because the world's upside down." "We only appear to like rules and regulations. What we really like is plumbing."
Danny does not gamble, and dislikes sports. This novel's essential metaphor is sports-related, however. We come to see Danny, in his ability to elude capture and remain in Australia, as "an athlete of the underground."
He realizes he is "in a game -- a big, international World Cup or Olympics. In this game, people were running from countries that were burning to not-yet-burning ones; catching boats, cutting barbed wire, snuggling into containers at the bottoms of ships, while another set of people were trying to stop, stall, catch or turn them back."
I read this novel on a long flight. Its opening pages are a reverie about Danny's life back in Sri Lanka, and there are mermaids and singing fish and a "magic island." Oh God, I thought, Adiga has become Salman Rushdie -- how do I pop the emergency exit? He hasn't become Rushdie. Keep reading.

Texto completo: Tiffany Ruiz had tried various gyms, apps, workout routines and diets, all in an effort to get fit and lose some weight. "None of them worked because none of them kept my interest," she said.
Now, Ruiz is working out at least four times a week, thanks to a video game.
In her bedroom, she sprints, squats, stretches and performs other exercises like knee lifts and shoulder presses, all while battling a muscle-bound dragon and its toadies in "Ring Fit Adventure," a new game from Nintendo, the Japanese consumer tech giant.
"I am so focused on beating the high score or conquering an enemy that before I know it, 30 minutes have passed," said Ruiz, 26, who is studying to become a nursing assistant in Bakersfield, California.
"Ring Fit Adventure," created for the Nintendo Switch console, is the latest effort by the video game industry to try to entice consumers to get up off the couch and become more active.
Developers are folding fitness into games as part of a dual-pronged strategy: to retain players by offering a physical twist on traditional gameplay and to draw in new ones like Ruiz who are looking to break up the monotony of working out.
"Developers are trying to reach people who want fun and fitness at the same time," said Rik Eberhardt, a program manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Game Lab. "They know fitness is good for them, but it can feel like a chore in their busy lives."
Fitness games make up just 1% of the market, but the overall industry is steadily growing. Sales of games across all platforms generated $35.4 billion in the United States last year, up 2% from 2018, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.
"Exergaming," a portmanteau of exercise and gaming, has been around since the late 1980s, when Bandai introduced Power Pad, a gray mat with pressure sensors, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Games now use motion sensors, smartwatches and even virtual reality to track a player's movement.
Some games disguise fitness routines in the form of role-playing, dancing or other activities like running from zombies. Others are fitness and health apps that lead users through workouts with scoreboards, real-time feedback and multiplayer options. Nintendo's Wii game console brought exergaming into the mainstream in 2006. Its "Wii Fit" game incorporated a balance board so players burned calories through calisthenics and yoga.
"The Wii had the fastest adoption rate in the U.S. of any console in the first three years," Mat Piscatella, an industry analyst for NPD, said. "Wii Fit" remains one of the bestselling games in the United States, according to NPD.
Nintendo's two main competitors, Microsoft and Sony, followed its lead, adding motion-detecting cameras to their consoles. Games like "Just Dance" and "Zumba Fitness: Join the Party," which were available on Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony consoles, were "breakout successes" in the motion era, Piscatella said.
Since then, the industry has been overturned by the rise of mobile devices, which allow games to be played on the go.
Exergames are not without risks, said Eefje Battel, a project manager at the Sports Innovation Campus at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Bruges, Belgium. One element missing in "Ring Fit," she said, is a coach to ensure that players are performing exercises correctly and safely.
"If you are squatting, the system will measure movement up and down, but it won't track posture," she said.

Texto completo: Paul Farnes, a Royal Air Force fighter pilot and the last surviving RAF ace of the Battle of Britain, in which he shot down six German aircraft and damaged a half-dozen more, died on Jan. 28 in West Sussex, England. He was 101.
His death was announced by the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust.
Farnes was one of the last survivors of the nearly 3,000 airmen called "The Few," a nickname inspired by Prime Minister Winston Churchill's tribute to them in August 1940 while the campaign, begun in July, raged on.
"Never in the field of human conflict," Churchill said, "was so much owed by so many to so few."
Farnes entered the Battle of Britain having destroyed three German Luftwaffe bombers, on his own or with a fellow fighter, during the Allies' defeat in the Battle of France in May.
With France having fallen, Britain had reached a critical point in World War II and now had to defend itself against a relentless aerial assault by the Luftwaffe. A German victory in the air would almost certainly have led to a ground invasion of Britain more than a year before the United States entered the war.
But for three months, through October, the RAF battled the Luftwaffe for supremacy in the skies over Britain. Flying a Hurricane fighter for the 501 Squadron, Farnes, a sergeant pilot, proved supremely adept at attacking German aircraft.
In August alone he shot down three Junkers Ju Stuka bombers, a Dornier 17 light bomber and a Messerschmitt 109E fighter.
At the end of September, as Farnes maneuvered his malfunctioning Hurricane back to the RAF's Kenley base, he spotted a German bomber flying directly at him at about 1,500 feet.
"I thought, 'Good God,' so I whipped out and had to reposition myself and managed to get 'round behind him," he said in an interview with the website History of War in 2017. "I gave him a couple of bursts, and he crashed at Gatwick just on the point between the airport and the racecourse."
When he landed at Gatwick, the station commander drove him to meet the German pilot, who had survived a crash landing. They did not speak -- neither knew the other's language -- but Farnes' attempt to shake hands with the enemy was rebuffed.
During one of his earlier shoot-downs, Farnes recalled, he had watched as the pilot bailed out of his aircraft and parachuted to the ground.
"I waved to him and I got a wave back," he said.
Farnes, who received the Distinguished Flying Medal in late October 1940, was the only member of "The Few" to attend an annual commemoration of the Battle of Britain in 2017.
"They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old," he said, reciting from a poem by Laurence Binyon in a village near Kent. "Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them."
Paul Caswell Powe Farnes was born on July 16, 1918, in Boscombe, England. His father was a married Australian soldier with three children; his mother died shortly after childbirth.
His father did not want to raise him, but the midwife who delivered him had taken a liking to him and adopted him. "I couldn't have had a more wonderful mother," he said when he was interviewed for an oral history about the Kenley base in 2017. "I was very lucky."
An indifferent student who attended a technical college, Farnes was working in a factory in London in 1938 when the prospect of war led him one day to a Royal Navy recruitment ship. Soon after, as he recalled, a friend of a friend suggested to him that flying might be more fun than serving on a ship and recommended that he join the RAF Volunteer Reserve.
But Farnes was worried that the circumstances of his birth would be an obstacle to joining the reserve. His adoptive mother wrote a letter on his behalf to the British Air Ministry voicing his concern; she was told that if he passed all the tests, he would be welcomed.
He was. After the war began in September 1939, Farnes went on active duty with the RAF, posted first at a base in Filton, near Bristol, and then in France in early 1940.
He was commissioned an officer after the Battle of Britain, became an instructor and served in Malta, North Africa and Iraq. He also commanded two squadrons in Britain.
After retiring from the RAF in 1958, he worked for his father-in-law in a building-material supply business and helped run a hotel, both in the seaside town of Worthing, on the English Channel.
His survivors include a daughter, Linda Martin, and a son, Jonathan. His two wives died before him, as did a second son, Nicholas.
Aerial warfare against the Germans meant breaking away from the squadron, finding something to shoot at, firing away, then breaking away to safety. But by Farnes' account it was also enjoyable, because he was able to combine his love of flying with the mission to protect Britain.
"The CO would quite often pick the next members of the squadron that had to be at 'readiness,' and the two or three who weren't picked would be pretty fed up," he told History of War. "If you weren't picked, you'd think, 'Why can't I go?' I'm sure one or two must have felt, 'Well, thank God I'm not going!' But a lot of us were quite happy to go."

Texto completo: On a finger numbingly cold morning, Lara Maiklem swung open a metal gate tucked behind a pub in southeast London and scrambled down a set of slick stone steps onto the banks of the River Thames.
The river runs through the city west to east, bisecting London as it winds past the new skyscrapers and old docks that line its banks.
But twice a day, the low tide pulls the flowing edges of the Thames back -- dropping the river level by 20 feet in some areas -- revealing centuries of forgotten London life in the fragments that poke out from the newly exposed land, known as the foreshore.
This is when the mudlarks, like Maiklem, come out.
"What you are looking for are straight lines and perfect circles," she said, her eyes scanning the surface of the mud for man-made artifacts. "They sort of stand out from the natural shapes."
Within minutes she had spotted fragments of a 17th-century jug, the half-face of a bearded man visible in the clay.
The name -- mudlark -- was first given to the Victorian-era poor who scrounged for items in the river to sell, pulling copper scraps, rope and other valuables from the shore. But more recently the label has stuck to London's hobbyists, history buffs and treasure hunters who scour the river edge searching for objects from the city's past.
Mudlarking's popularity has grown steadily in recent years, driven in part by social media communities in which enthusiasts share their finds and tour groups that offer a trudge through the shards of history's castoffs.
Dr. Fiona Haughey, a London archaeologist who has worked on the Thames since the 1990s, said that although some mudlarks are looking for valuables, others are looking for a connection with the everyday objects of a bygone Britain.
But it's the connection with the layers of lives of Londoners before them, revealed by the tides of the river at the heart of the metropolis, that unites the enthusiasts.
For Haughey, a specialist in prehistory, it's about what an object can tell her about its owner rather than what value it has.
"I love the conundrum of it," she said.
The Port of London Authority, which owns the Thames waterway along with the Crown Estate (i.e. Queen Elizabeth II), began to regulate exploration along the shore in 2016, requiring anyone searching the banks to have a foreshore permit.
These permits -- about 1,500 were issued this year -- allow people to explore the terrain, and scrape or dig into the mud up to a depth of around 3 inches. Mudlarks are advised to report objects that could be of archaeological interest to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, run by the British Museum.
Stuart Wyatt, the regional finds liaison officer based at the Museum of London who assesses the artifacts, said there was a "huge increase in numbers" of mudlarks in recent years.
"I now have months where I see only new finders," he said by email.
Britain legally obligates anyone who unearths "treasure" -- defined as single finds of gold and silver over 300 years old, and hoards of coins and prehistoric metalwork -- to inform the government.
Britain takes this law seriously, as one amateur treasure hunter learned in November. He was given a decadelong jail sentence after failing, along with another man, to report the discovery of a Viking hoard they dug up in western England.
A specialized permit allows deeper digging to a depth of nearly 4 feet. But those permits are available only to members of the exclusive Society of Thames Mudlarks -- an invitation-only group of around 50 members -- who have already held a standard permit and reported their findings to the Museum of London for two years.
Some mudlarks bring metal detectors. But most simply recover what the river has naturally revealed, usually a fascinating trinket rather than treasure.
"I like just to collect what the river decides it's going to leave on that day," Maiklem said. "It's that element of luck."
But sometimes there are more significant finds, like the first "spintria" found in Britain. Spintriae are Roman bronze tokens, with depictions of sexual acts on one face and a Roman numeral on the other, whose purpose remains uncertain.
And every tide reveals some of the city's varied story: Roman coins, medieval badges worn by religious pilgrims, an elaborate 17th-century watch.
The Thames, the very reason people began settling in the city over 2,000 years ago, is one of the best preservers of London's history. The river has been used many ways over the millenniums -- as a highway, a source of food and, most important to mudlarks, as a dump.
"The Thames is unpredictable, so its just all mixed up, like a big washing machine," said Jason Sandy, an architect who mudlarks in his spare time.
In the center of London, where the heart of the Roman city stood, many of the finds are Roman or medieval. Farther west, evidence of prehistoric settlements have been found.
Where Maiklem was exploring, in Rotherhithe, once an old shipping center in eastern London, finds from the 16th and 17th centuries are the norm.
This particular morning, the sun was just rising and the tide was still on its way out as she clambered over rocks.
Her eyes flicked quickly over the mud, scattered with bits of modern trash, and settled on the barely visible edge of a coin nestled against a wooden post. She plucked it out and wiped away the grime, revealing a George III farthing, the silhouetted face of the monarch and the date, 1777, nearly rubbed smooth.
The coin had been bent into an "S" shape and had a small hole poked through its edge where a chain could be attached, hallmarks that it was likely a love token. At her feet, pieces of clay tobacco pipes from the 16th and 17th century clinked as they washed against rocks, so common as to escape a mudlark's interest.
But a perfectly round musket ball was worth plucking from the muck. The leather sole of a hand-stitched shoe, preserved by the anaerobic mud, flapped in the breeze, and she tugged at its toes to wrest it from the bank.
Huge wooden beams from the ships broken up here in the 17th and 18th centuries jut out of the mud. The Mayflower is believed to have been broken down here for scrap.
"There are so many ghosts locked in the foreshore," Maiklem said. "Also, it's so fleeting because if it's not collected from the surface, it's going to be washed away or broken down."

Texto completo: The sting of Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016 still hangs heavy over the Democratic Party. There has yet to emerge a consensus understanding of the party's failure to beat an opponent who almost everyone assumed could be defeated. Some have focused on voter suppression, others on Russian interference. Clinton continues to blame Bernie Sanders. But missing from the various theories is how Barack Obama's tenure may also have contributed to voter disaffection because he failed to bring about the transformational changes he promised. ...
Black voters' attitudes about the impact of the Obama administration are complicated because they hold Barack and Michelle Obama in such high regard. As president, Obama enjoyed extraordinarily high approval ratings among African Americans, even as black unemployment remained high. His personal popularity notwithstanding, African Americans' ratings of public policy, race relations and the state of the country declined over his presidency. ...
It is undeniable that the Republican Party blocked or curtailed most of Obama's legislative efforts, but his commitment to bipartisanship also undermined and diluted his professed agenda. His efforts to "reach across the aisle" resulted in compromises that came at the expense of the Democratic base.
The reluctance to fully interrogate the Obama years also means that Obama continues to have outsize influence in the party. ... It means that he is able to continue advocating for centrist politics as the guiding strategy for the party as it seeks to oust Trump.

Ohio's Democratic primary still appears unpredictable

Texto completo: Predicting the story you'll be reading in a little less than a month after Ohio Democrats finally cast their presidential primary ballots is quite likely a fool's errand.
After all, Democrats in about two dozen states — including California and Texas with their huge delegate hauls — will vote before Ohio's St. Patrick's Day primary. And three more debates are scheduled, including one in Phoenix two days before Ohio voters go to the polls. Tuesday was the final day to register to vote in the March 17 primary.
So a battlescape that currently shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar surging, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren struggling and former Vice President Joe Biden fading could look far different in a month — especially once free-spending Michael Bloomberg joins the hunt for votes.
Several of the candidates already have set up shop in Ohio, although no one is coming close to the presence of Bloomberg's operation. President Donald Trump is unopposed for the GOP primary nod.
John Green, veteran director of the University of Akron's Ray C. Bliss Institute for Applied Politics, sees two possible storylines for the 2020 Buckeye State primary.
"The conventional scenario is that the front-runner, Sanders, rides momentum to win Nevada and South Carolina, and rivals begin to drop out, such as Biden and Warren. The front-runner then faces a reduced field on Super Tuesday (March 3), does well, and only one viable rival is left standing by Ohio — probably Buttigieg, but maybe Bloomberg."
But Green says it may not be so simple.
"The alternative scenario is that most candidates stay in — largely because of the combination of multiple candidates and the proportional assignments of delegates. ... The current polls in Nevada suggest that even if Sanders comes in first, others will share in the delegates.
"And if Biden wins in South Carolina, he will stay in through Super Tuesday. Bloomberg may — or may not — score big on Super Tuesday, but either way, multiple candidates come into Ohio."
That means, Ohio Democratic Chairman David Pepper says, "Our primary will be an important prize."
Who will win?
"Ohio Democrats want a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump this November while also representing our values and Ohio values. Needless to say, the primary gives each candidate the opportunity to prove that they are that person," said Pepper.
Ohio's March 17 primary ballot includes 11 Democratic presidential candidates, although fewer are still campaigning after the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. No candidate filed the appropriate paperwork to remove their name from Ohio's ballot after dropping out.
Bloomberg's Ohio effort is consistent with his national strategy of ignoring early voting states where relatively few delegates are awarded and concentrating on the delegate-rich states in March.
In Ohio, Bloomberg's campaign has 91 paid staff members, including Aaron Pickrell, who ran President Barack Obama's 2008 operation in Ohio. In comparison, Bloomberg's campaign has hired at least 70 paid staff members in Florida, whose primary is the same day as Ohio's, according to the New York Times.
Team Bloomberg has 12 offices around the state, including a headquarters and two satellite offices in Columbus. The campaign has "hundreds of volunteers," and has knocked more than 14,000 doors so far, spokeswoman Meredith Tucker said.
Warren got an early start in Ohio. She hired her first paid staff here in October, and that presence has grown in the ensuing months. Warren's campaign has offices in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati, and it has more than 20 paid staff members on the ground in Ohio.
Buttigieg's campaign is jumpstarting its Ohio operation this week by hiring a state director as it starts to shift its focus to the March contests. Buttigieg has 23 volunteer leads and 1,300 Ohioans signed up to volunteer on the campaign. They have organized 150 events in Ohio so far. The campaign put out a plea last week for Ohioans to provide temporary housing for campaign volunteers moving into the state.
Biden's campaign hasn't yet hired any paid staff in Ohio, but Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, who worked for Biden in the White House, has been working to drum up support for the former vice president.
Julia Krieger, Biden's regional Super Tuesday communications director, said he "has received dozens of endorsements from elected officials at all levels of government — including former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland — who support Vice President Biden and his vision for our country. This wide breadth of support is also a testament to Biden's electability against Trump but also his strength to deliver wins up and down the ticket in battleground states like Ohio, where he continues to remain strong."
Green said more moderate candidates such as Biden tend to play better in Ohio, but Buttigieg and Klobuchar also will get an extra look because of their Midwestern roots.
C.J. Warnke, Klobuchar's deputy national press secretary, offered on a general description on her Ohio effort: "Thanks to Senator Klobuchar's strong debate performances, tireless campaigning, and field staff dedicated to organizing throughout the state, our team is seeing a major upswing in momentum, including in Ohio, where we plan to continue ramping up operations."
Sanders has an active network of volunteers in Ohio, and one of his leading national spokespersons, Nina Turner, is a former state senator from Cleveland.
Will an early presence in Ohio make a difference in the primary?
"We are strong proponents of candidates' investing to organize in Ohio, and we're grateful to every candidate that is investing and organizing on the ground here," Pepper said. "Certainly that kind of early infrastructure is an important part of doing well here, just as the ultimate nominee building a strong operation in the summer and fall will be key to turning Ohio blue."

Texto completo: Granville Schools' Susan Larson has been named a music of the year by the Columbus Symphony.
Larson is one of the announced winners of the "2020 Music Educator Awards," honoring individuals "who make a difference in the community through a dedication to music education and promotion of a greater understanding of and appreciation for the art form," according to a Columbus Symphony press release.
Three nominees from across central Ohio were selected in the categories of elementary, secondary, and community education.
Larson, founder and artistic director of the Newark-Granville Youth Symphony, was selected for the 2020 Music Educator Award – Community Education.
She was surprised with the honor by symphony officials during an evening rehearsal with her students at the Reese Center on the OSU-Newark Campus.
"I thought we were going to be kicked off the stage," Larson said when members of the CS entered the auditorium to surprise her.
Bob Cochran of the Symphony Board of Directors told Larson's students, "You know how hard she works... Those of you who have been in here a while know how much she means to you."
From 2006-11, Larson was director of orchestras for Newark City Schools. In 2009, her string orchestra, the Newark High School Sinfonia, was awarded first runner up for the National Orchestra Cup at Lincoln Center, earning the orchestra a front-page story in The New York Times and an invitation to the White House, according to a symphony news release.
For 15 years, Larson previously served as director of orchestras for Bexley City Schools.
She is a violin, viola, and chamber music instructor for the Denison University Suzuki Program and executive director of the Newark-Granville Symphony Orchestra.
She has been a conductor and clinician for school ensembles, regional orchestras, and honors orchestras throughout the Midwest. She has conducted the Women in Music Symphony Orchestra and String Sinfonia and has served as conductor and music director for Otterbein University.
Each award winner is to receive a $2,500 grant to spend at their discretion on music education endeavors.
Past winners have used these funds to host guest instructors, repair instruments, take professional development classes, or purchase instruments, computer software, and music, according to the Columbus Symphony.
The winners will be presented with their awards on Saturday, March 28, at 5:30 p.m. at The Sheraton Capitol Square, 75 E. State St.
Tickets to the dinner are $65, and include admission to the Columbus Symphony concert, "The Rite of Spring," at the Ohio Theatre at 8 p.m. Tickets can be purchased by calling 614-221-4916 before March 16.
The Music Educator Awards were made possible through the support of Kim and Jude Swanson with additional support from Canneto Studios.

In Ohio, Bloomberg's campaign has 91 paid staff members, including Aaron Pickrell, who ran President Barack Obama's 2008 operation in Ohio. In comparison, Bloomberg's campaign has hired at least 70 paid staff members in Florida, whose primary is the same day as Ohio's, according to the New York Times.
Team Bloomberg has 12 offices around the state, including a headquarters and two satellite offices in Columbus. The campaign has "hundreds of volunteers," and has knocked more than 14,000 doors so far, spokeswoman Meredith Tucker said.
Warren got an early start in Ohio. She hired her first paid staff here in October, and that presence has grown in the ensuing months. Warren's campaign has offices in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati, and it has more than 20 paid staff members on the ground in Ohio.
Buttigieg's campaign is jumpstarting its Ohio operation this week by hiring a state director as it starts to shift its focus to the March contests. Buttigieg has 23 volunteer leads and 1,300 Ohioans signed up to volunteer on the campaign. They have organized 150 events in Ohio so far. The campaign put out a plea last week for Ohioans to provide temporary housing for campaign volunteers moving into the state.
Biden's campaign hasn't yet hired any paid staff in Ohio, but Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, who worked for Biden in the White House, has been working to drum up support for the former vice president.
Julia Krieger, Biden's regional Super Tuesday communications director, said he "has received dozens of endorsements from elected officials at all levels of government — including former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland — who support Vice President Biden and his vision for our country. This wide breadth of support is also a testament to Biden's electability against Trump but also his strength to deliver wins up and down the ticket in battleground states like Ohio, where he continues to remain strong."
Green said more moderate candidates such as Biden tend to play better in Ohio, but Buttigieg and Klobuchar also will get an extra look because of their Midwestern roots.
C.J. Warnke, Klobuchar's deputy national press secretary, offered on a general description on her Ohio effort: "Thanks to Senator Klobuchar's strong debate performances, tireless campaigning, and field staff dedicated to organizing throughout the state, our team is seeing a major upswing in momentum, including in Ohio, where we plan to continue ramping up operations."
Sanders has an active network of volunteers in Ohio, and one of his leading national spokespersons, Nina Turner, is a former state senator from Cleveland.
Will an early presence in Ohio make a difference in the primary?
"We are strong proponents of candidates' investing to organize in Ohio, and we're grateful to every candidate that is investing and organizing on the ground here," Pepper said. "Certainly that kind of early infrastructure is an important part of doing well here, just as the ultimate nominee building a strong operation in the summer and fall will be key to turning Ohio blue."

Visiting NJ Maritime Museum could help you live longer

Texto completo: No fake news here. "Going to Museums May be Good for Your Health" is the title of a recent New York Times article. "People engaged in the arts lived longer than those who were not, a study found."
The New Jersey Maritime Museum can attest to the above. Visitors of all ages come in with smiling faces, questions galore, and bring stories of their own. Docents are equally friendly, full of New Jersey's history, and can usually answer most questions, find a book with the information sought, or give them the name and email of someone who can.
"There is evidence that simply being exposed to the arts may help people ... who just went to a museum just once or twice a year were 14% less likely less likely to die during that period."
Put visiting the NJ Maritime Museum a few times a year on your calendar or in your head. That should increase your chances of living longer.
To continue with excerpts from the New York Times article:
"Researchers theorized that people who expose themselves to the arts are more likely to be engaged in the world. Being involved and excited by the arts keeps and maintains your purpose in life.
"The study also noted that engaging in the arts can reduce loneliness, promote empathy and emotional intelligence, and keep people from becoming sedentary – all factors that contribute to a longer life."
The above could be a personal advertisement for volunteering at the NJ Maritime Museum. Needed are summer volunteers (June – Labor Day weekend) who will donate one day a week of their time to greet visitors and show them around. Also needed are year round volunteers to come in on their own time to organize some of the 400 GB of scanned high resolution photos and rare documents.
Are you looking for an internship in the coming months? The museum needs people of all ages and abilities. For example, can you write grants? Call 609-492-0202 or email info@NJMM.org. Like Uncle Sam pointed in World War II posters, "We Want You." You won't find a finer group of people who can laugh and yet get the job done than at the NJ Maritime Museum.
"Similar studies have shown the benefits of exposing children and adolescents to art, and found that children who were taken to on field trips to museums performed better in school and higher on standardized tests than those who did not take field trips."
Grade school children and older ones who know more history love the museum. They are full of questions, and get a small education about New Jersey maritime and local history that is no longer taught in schools. We love kids and they love us.
"Advocates said the study was a reminder of how critical it is for the arts to be more accessible to Americans of all incomes."
There is no admission charge to visit the NJ Maritime Museum at 528 Dock Road. in Beach Haven. Donations are cheerfully accepted in boxes if people choose.
Nast Dive Room Speaking of donations, the family foundation of Michael G. Nast has made a donation in his honor, and the dive room at the museum will be officially named the Michael G. Nast Dive Room. Michael was born in Mount Holly, graduated from Haverford College and Cornell Law School.
Michael died doing what he loved best, diving. He was an accomplished New Jersey wreck diver, and participated in Long Beach Island events including the 18 Mile Run. In addition he loved fishing and hunting. Michael Nast was an assistant district attorney in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and was active in the American Bar Association. New exhibits will be on display this coming summer in the Michael G. Nast Diving Room.
"Peace, tranquility, and rejuvenation" are mentioned in the New York Times article. Peace may be found by learning the fate of a loved one at sea. Rejuvenation can be found when members and visitors echo "I never knew that!" But the NJ Maritime Museum does not promise tranquility. Hopefully, all visitors will be excited, taking pictures, asking questions and telling stories of their own.
Make a resolution in 2020 to visit, join, and volunteer at the New Jersey Maritime Museum. Volunteers are needed, and the New York Times article has just proved that the public needs the NJ Maritime Museum.

Video games get them off sofa Companies aim to make players more active, fold fitness into fun products

Texto completo: Tiffany Ruiz had tried various gyms, apps, workout routines and diets, all in an effort to get fit and lose some weight. "None of them worked because none of them kept my interest," she said.
Now, Ruiz is working out at least four times a week, thanks to a video game.
In her bedroom, she sprints, squats, stretches and performs other exercises like knee lifts and shoulder presses, all while battling a muscle-bound dragon and its toadies in "Ring Fit Adventure," a new game from Nintendo, the Japanese consumer tech giant.
"I am so focused on beating the high score or conquering an enemy that before I know it, 30 minutes have passed," said Ruiz, 26, who is studying to become a nursing assistant in Bakersfield, California.
"Ring Fit Adventure," created for the Nintendo Switch console, is the latest effort by the video game industry to try to entice consumers to get up off the couch and become more active.
Developers are folding fitness into games as part of a dual-pronged strategy: to retain players by offering a physical twist on traditional gameplay and to draw in new ones like Ruiz who are looking to break up the monotony of working out.
"Developers are trying to reach people who want fun and fitness at the same time," said Rik Eberhardt, a program manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Game Lab. "They know fitness is good for them, but it can feel like a chore in their busy lives."
Fitness games make up just 1% of the market, but the overall industry is steadily growing. Sales of games across all platforms generated $35.4 billion in the United States last year, up 2% from 2018, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.
"Exergaming," a portmanteau of exercise and gaming, has been around since the late 1980s, when Bandai introduced Power Pad, a gray mat with pressure sensors, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Games now use motion sensors, smartwatches and even virtual reality to track a player's movement.
Some games disguise fitness routines in the form of role-playing, dancing or other activities like running from zombies. Others are fitness and health apps that lead users through workouts with scoreboards, real-time feedback and multiplayer options. Nintendo's Wii game console brought exergaming into the mainstream in 2006. Its "Wii Fit" game incorporated a balance board so players burned calories through calisthenics and yoga.
"The Wii had the fastest adoption rate in the U.S. of any console in the first three years," Mat Piscatella, an industry analyst for NPD, said. "Wii Fit" remains one of the bestselling games in the United States, according to NPD.
Nintendo's two main competitors, Microsoft and Sony, followed its lead, adding motion-detecting cameras to their consoles. Games like "Just Dance" and "Zumba Fitness: Join the Party," which were available on Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony consoles, were "breakout successes" in the motion era, Piscatella said.
Since then, the industry has been overturned by the rise of mobile devices, which allow games to be played on the go.
Exergames are not without risks, said Eefje Battel, a project manager at the Sports Innovation Campus at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Bruges, Belgium. One element missing in "Ring Fit," she said, is a coach to ensure that players are performing exercises correctly and safely.
"If you are squatting, the system will measure movement up and down, but it won't track posture," she said.

Arcosanti won't host 2020 FORM festival

Texto completo: FORM will not return to the experimental town of Arcosanti in May as expected.
The people who run the Arizona arts community near Cordes Junction shared the news on Facebook, writing, "Our partners at FORM are pivoting the event this year, an effort the Arcosanti community wishes them the utmost success in."
Tim Bell, Arcosanti's director of community engagement says the FORM team has "built a very large music program very quickly, when you look at where the event started — as an album release party just a few years ago — to where it was last year."
The festival's 2019 headliners included Florence + the Machine, Anderson .Paak & the Free Nationals, Kaytranada and Skrillex.
It's Bell's understanding, he says, that the festival's organizers were having trouble finding a way to produce the event at Arcosanti on the same scale they had in 2019.
"So, ultimately," he says, "it was decided that we're both gonna take a year off of the relationship and let them sort of go back to the drawing board."
FORM organizers told The Arizona Republic that they are preparing a statement.
What is FORM and how has Arcosanti shaped it? FORM is more a cultural experience than a music festival, with Arcosanti, located about 70 miles north of Phoenix, serving as a breathtaking backdrop guaranteed to stand out on the festival circuit.
Italian-born architect Paolo Soleri began construction on the town in 1970 as an arcology experiment to demonstrate how urban conditions could be improved with minimal use of natural resources and harm to the environment.
FORM was launched in 2014 by Hundred Waters as a three-day, free-by-application experience that also served as a record release celebration. The event grew exponentially in its six years at Arcosanti.
Festival goers, performers, volunteers and Arcosanti residents continued to co-mingle and share in the collaborative creative journey as they brought in headliners including Charli XCX, Fleet Foxes, Beach House, Father John Misty and Solange.
Attendees and artists alike were strongly encourage to camp onsite.
In addition to concerts, FORM offered art installations, yoga, late night dance parties hosted by Skrillex and more. Last year's highlights included Fred Armisen's musical comedy and a powerful performance-art piece titled "Knot" by Black Lives Matter activist Patrisse Cullors, exploring the ways black women are bound by society.
Through the years, the festival has drawn attention far beyond Arizona, with articles appearing in such publications ranging from Noisey to the New York Times.
Will FORM return to Arcosanti? Bell seems fairly optimistic that the festival will return to Arcosanti next year.
"We're definitely hoping that given the amount of time that we now have — between them having taking this year off and the potential of hosting them next year — that we're able to come back to the table and make this thing happen in a way that's good for all parties involved."
FORM has been a very positive experience for Arcosanti, he says.
"I don't think you can dismiss FORM's role in basically introducing Arcosanti to a new generation of people who might be interested in taking up the call and stewarding the project," Bell says. "I myself actually heard about Arcosanti for the first time because of FORM. I read an article about it in the New York Times in 2014."
Arcosanti celebrating its 50th anniversary If FORM had to take a break from hosting Arcosanti, the timing worked out pretty well, Bell says.
"On our end, it's not necessarily a bad thing because we have our 50th anniversary that we're celebrating in 2020," he says.
"So we've already got a lot on our plate that we're trying to figure out right now and having that time on our calendar to do a little bit more strategic thinking about how we want to celebrate the 50th anniversary is important."
As to whether Arcosanti's anniversary celebrations could include a FORM-like festival, don't count on it.
As Bell says, "We don't have the means to bring to bear anything of that scale. We're basically looking for people who are interested in using Arcosanti as a conference retreat venue, which is something that we're ideally set up for. It really is a stunning site. And we're hoping to leverage all the best parts of Arcosanti for events that are a little bit more manageable for us in size."
In the meantime, Bell is hoping FORM fans will consider spending time at Arcosanti without a major music festival to share on Instagram.
"It would be great just to remind people that Arcosanti exists 362 other days of the year that are not FORM," he says. "We have a lot of really wonderful things happening up here all the time between educational workshops, conferences, retreats and other events. And we hope that even without FORM, people are still interested in coming up and spending time in what is one of Arizona's sort of undiscovered treasures."

Who is Amy Berman Jackson, judge in Roger Stone case who has been criticized by Trump and his allies?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – U. S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has been in the spotlight for the past two years, often criticized by President Donald Trump's supporters and, last week, by the president himself.
The president's swipe at Jackson, days before the judge is set to decide whether to send Trump's longtime friend and ally to prison – and for how long – opened the floodgates to more attacks. The legal community came to Jackson’s defense, exalting not only her independence from public and political pressure but also that of the judiciary.
When Roger Stone is set to be sentenced Thursday, eyes will be on Jackson, a former federal prosecutor and daughter of an Army doctor. It will be her moment to show that at a time of entrenched partisanship, the third branch of government doesn’t succumb to political pressure, said Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D. C. , who recommended Jackson to the federal bench in 2011.
“She has got to essentially, using this case, vindicate the judiciary system itself, to show that it is entirely independent,” Norton said.
Jackson has presided over many of the criminal cases that sprouted from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, including several that involved Trump's closest aides and associates.
'Angst, anger and disappointment': Roger Stone intervention stokes uncertainty across federal justice system
Fact check: Trump says 'nobody can even define' what Roger Stone did. Here are crimes Stone committed
The case against Stone, who was found guilty of seven crimes, including lying to Congress, proved to be the most contentious. What began as a standard Justice Department process of recommending a prison sentence for a defendant erupted into a political crisis as Trump persistently tweeted about the agency’s prosecution of his allies.
In the days leading up to Stone’s sentencing, the Justice Department caused an uproar after it intervened to reduce its prosecutors’ recommendation of up to nine years in prison for the 67-year-old political operative. Four career prosecutors withdrew from the case. One resigned from the Justice Department entirely.
U. S. District Judge Beryl Howell, the chief judge in the court where Jackson serves, issued a rare public statement defending how sentences are determined. “Public criticism or pressure is not a factor,” she said. An association of federal judges scheduled an emergency meeting to discuss concerns about political interference in criminal cases.
By Tuesday, news outlets reported that Attorney General William Barr had considered resigning his post amid a dispute over the president’s tweets criticizing the Justice Department.
Barr and Trump: AG Barr considered resigning over President Trump's intervention in Justice investigations
Calls for resignation: More than 2,000 ex-DOJ employees call for Attorney General Barr's resignation
Whatever the events that dominated the news cycle over the past week, “the ball really stops in the judge’s court,” Norton said, citing a Supreme Court ruling that gives judges discretion in imposing sentences.
“She can do anything she wants to do,” Norton said of Jackson, “and that is exactly what I expect her to do. ”
Before the federal bench
Jackson, 65, was born in Baltimore. Her father was a Korean War veteran who served in the Army medical corps. Her mother, as she said during her confirmation hearing in 2011, raised her in a household where she was “blissfully unaware that there was anything that I couldn’t do when I grew up as long as I got off the phone and did my homework. ”
She lauded her grandparents who came to the U. S. on a boat “with nothing, to escape oppression. ” She wore her grandmother’s necklace to “remember the woman who came here, learned the language, became a citizen, was a suffragette, raised three daughters and ran a business. ”
Jackson studied at Harvard College and Harvard Law School. She spent the first years of her career as a federal prosecutor in the U. S. attorney’s office in Washington, where she handled high-profile murder and sexual assault cases. She switched to private practice, handling white-collar cases and civil litigation.
During the mid-1990s, Jackson took a leave from her practice to care for her family. She and her ex-husband, a former Department of Commerce assistant secretary under President George W. Bush, have two sons.
Stone asks for new trial: Judge rejects request from Trump ally Roger Stone to delay sentencing hearing
Roger Stone: Four career prosecutors are the target of Trump's anger. Here's how they came up with a stiff sentence for Roger Stone.
Jackson returned to work in 2000. A few years later, she and two law partners defended former Rep. William Jefferson, D-La. , who was charged with fraud and bribery. The case grabbed headlines after the FBI discovered $90,000 in cash hidden in Jefferson’s freezer. The FBI raided the lawmaker’s congressional office, raising constitutional questions about whether the materials confiscated were privileged.
Jackson and her partners sought to keep the records from becoming public. President Bush stepped in and ordered that the documents be kept private.
“It’s not every day that a lawyer gets his motion granted by the president of the United States,” Jackson told partner Robert Trout, who recounted the conversation during an oral history interview for the Historical Society of the District of Columbia Circuit.
'I am a real person'
During her confirmation hearing for the federal bench, Jackson was asked about judicial temperament.
“Obviously, I have not served as a judge, but I would hope that what my background investigation has revealed is that of all the many things that can be said about me, that I am a real person and I relate to other people from all walks of life,” Jackson said.
“And I think that ability to connect and to understand will inform my judging, hopefully, inform my temperament and help me achieve the goal that I have, which is to rule efficiently, because I think people are waiting for your rulings, and to rule clearly, because I think people need to understand them,” she said.
The Senate confirmed Jackson 97-0.
As a judge, Jackson delivers long explanations of her thinking before she imposes a sentence. During the sentencing hearing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort last year, the judge gave a withering rebuke of the political operative.
“Saying I’m sorry I got caught is not an inspiring plea for leniency,” she said.
Paul Manafort gets 7. 5 years in prison: 'It is hard to overstate the number of lies'
Manafort’s defense attorney criticized her comments.
“The judge displayed a level of callousness and hostility that I have not seen before,” Kevin Downing said outside the courthouse.
Jackson's judicial record
Critics of Jackson accuse her of bias against Trump and his associates, noting that she was appointed by President Barack Obama.
Her defenders point to her judicial record, saying her rulings have been friendly and hostile to both sides of the aisle.
In 2012, she ruled that the Obama administration overstepped its authority in revoking the permit of a coal mining company. That same year, a New York Times editorial praised her for striking down regulations that allowed some groups to hide their campaign donors.
In 2016, she rejected the Obama administration’s claim of executive privilege to block a congressional committee from obtaining records related to a bungled gun-trafficking investigation code-named Fast and Furious.
She dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit in 2017 brought against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by families of two Americans who were killed in 2012 in an attack in Benghazi, Libya. Larry Klayman, the families’ attorney, called the ruling “intellectually dishonest” and accused Jackson of protecting Clinton.
Ruth Kassinger, who has known Jackson since they were in eighth grade in Baltimore, defended her friend.
“I think her judicial record is one of fair-mindedness. It is impossible that she would act in any way contrary to her duty to impartiality,” Kassinger said in an email to USA TODAY. “Impossible – that’s just who she is. ”
It would also be impossible to know Jackson “without being aware of her quick humor and her delight in musical theater,” Kassinger said.
During a ceremony in 2013 for former Chief Judge Royce Lamberth, a group of new judges performed a skit teasing him over his love for Texas, his home state.
Jackson, wearing a purple dress and a cowboy hat, sang a parody of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way. ”

Texto completo: Tiffany Ruiz had tried various gyms, apps, workout routines and diets, all in an effort to get fit and lose some weight. "None of them worked because none of them kept my interest," she said.
Now, Ruiz is working out at least four times a week, thanks to a video game.
In her bedroom, she sprints, squats, stretches and performs other exercises like knee lifts and shoulder presses, all while battling a muscle-bound dragon and its toadies in "Ring Fit Adventure," a new game from Nintendo, the Japanese consumer tech giant.
"I am so focused on beating the high score or conquering an enemy that before I know it, 30 minutes have passed," said Ruiz, 26, who is studying to become a nursing assistant in Bakersfield, California.
"Ring Fit Adventure," created for the Nintendo Switch console, is the latest effort by the video game industry to try to entice consumers to get up off the couch and become more active.
Developers are folding fitness into games as part of a dual-pronged strategy: to retain players by offering a physical twist on traditional gameplay and to draw in new ones like Ruiz who are looking to break up the monotony of working out.
"Developers are trying to reach people who want fun and fitness at the same time," said Rik Eberhardt, a program manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Game Lab. "They know fitness is good for them, but it can feel like a chore in their busy lives."
Fitness games make up just 1% of the market, but the overall industry is steadily growing. Sales of games across all platforms generated $35.4 billion in the United States last year, up 2% from 2018, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.
"Exergaming," a portmanteau of exercise and gaming, has been around since the late 1980s, when Bandai introduced Power Pad, a gray mat with pressure sensors, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Games now use motion sensors, smartwatches and even virtual reality to track a player's movement.
Some games disguise fitness routines in the form of role-playing, dancing or other activities like running from zombies. Others are fitness and health apps that lead users through workouts with scoreboards, real-time feedback and multiplayer options. Nintendo's Wii game console brought exergaming into the mainstream in 2006. Its "Wii Fit" game incorporated a balance board so players burned calories through calisthenics and yoga.
"The Wii had the fastest adoption rate in the U.S. of any console in the first three years," Mat Piscatella, an industry analyst for NPD, said. "Wii Fit" remains one of the bestselling games in the United States, according to NPD.
Nintendo's two main competitors, Microsoft and Sony, followed its lead, adding motion-detecting cameras to their consoles. Games like "Just Dance" and "Zumba Fitness: Join the Party," which were available on Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony consoles, were "breakout successes" in the motion era, Piscatella said.
Since then, the industry has been overturned by the rise of mobile devices, which allow games to be played on the go.
Exergames are not without risks, said Eefje Battel, a project manager at the Sports Innovation Campus at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Bruges, Belgium. One element missing in "Ring Fit," she said, is a coach to ensure that players are performing exercises correctly and safely.
"If you are squatting, the system will measure movement up and down, but it won't track posture," she said.

Milken's pardon follows campaign to rehab image Junk bond king known as poster boy of 1980s greed

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump pardoned Michael Milken on Tuesday, it came just a week after the former junk bond king's Milken Institute had wrapped up its latest conference in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
The gathering featured a mix of high-powered leaders, including hedge-fund guru Ray Dalio and former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, but it wasn't just about how to make money or navigate the Washington, D.C., thicket. Reflecting the Santa Monica, Calif., institute's focus, the program of the 2020 Middle East and Africa Summit featured sessions on health, global diseases, education and the environment.
The event was only the latest manifestation of the 73-year-old's decadeslong commitment to philanthropy. It began before he pleaded guilty to felony violations of securities laws in 1990, but was ramped up in the years since in what became either an intentional or unintentional effort, depending on your view, to rehabilitate his image as the poster boy of 1980s greed.
In a tearful admission of guilt in a New York City federal courtroom, Milken pleaded in April 1990 to counts of conspiracy; aiding and abetting failure to meet federal securities disclosure regulations; securities fraud; aiding and abetting a regulated broker-dealer to violate securities reporting requirements; mail fraud; and assisting in filing a false tax return.
Milken was given a 10-year sentence, fined $200 million and required to pay $400 million in restitution. He later settled lawsuits for an additional $500 million. He served 22 months at a minimum-security prison dubbed "Club Fed" in Dublin, Calif., and was released after testifying against a former colleague. He also was banned for life from the securities industry.
Milken was among 11 felons who were either granted pardons or commutations of their sentences by Trump on Tuesday. Among the others was former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was serving a 14-year sentence for trying to sell an open U.S. Senate seat held by Barack Obama.
The president's decision follows a long campaign by Milken's supporters to win a pardon for him. In 2018, financier Anthony Scaramucci, who served briefly as Trump's communications director, told the Los Angeles Times that Los Angeles financier Gary Winnick, a former associate of Milken at now-defunct investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, had raised the issue at Trump's inauguration, citing his "commitment to health and global progress."
Other proponents of a Milken pardon at the time were said to include Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; and Rudy Giuliani, Trump's outside counsel.
It was Giuliani's investigation of Wall Street malfeasance in the 1980s, when he was a federal prosecutor, that led to Milken's guilty plea and imprisonment.
Through his pioneering use of junk bonds, Milken was credited with rescuing companies running low on cash or never had much to start with.
But critics accused him of enabling corporate raiders to plunder and gut viable corporations, laying off workers by the thousands.
The New York Times called Milken "the most powerful, most innovative, and most feared American financier since J.P. Morgan." He wasn't known for lavish living, but his $550 million salary and bonus in 1987 alone prompted outcries in newspaper editorials.
When Milken was sentenced in 1990, Richard Breeden, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, argued that the legendary trader "stood at the center of a network of manipulation, fraud, and deceit."
Milken, however, insisted that his work created many more jobs than it killed - and that even some of those could have been saved if companies under threat of takeover had been more efficient.
Shortly after his release from prison in 1993, Milken was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer and given 18 months to live.
Surprising some of his doctors, he survived - and started a foundation that channeled more than $700 million into prostate research. In 2004, Fortune magazine declared Milken "the man who changed medicine," pointing to the increased funding and visibility he had brought to the fight against prostate cancer.
Milken also founded the Milken Institute, a think tank that promotes capitalist solutions to global challenges. It annually brings together several thousand of the world's most successful people in business, government, entertainment, sports, arts and the sciences.

Texto completo: HADDONFIELD – When Stephanie and Stephen Scibal were approached about appearing on HGTV's "Beachfront Bargain Hunt," they had one caveat for producers: An extra house hunter could arrive at any moment.
Stephanie was 38 weeks pregnant with the Stratford couple's first child when they filmed their episode in Ocean City last September.
"We were like, 'Should we do it? Are we going to be able to do it? Am I going to have this baby by then?' So we scheduled it tentatively," Stephanie said.
As it turned out, little Savanna Scibal — now nearly 5 months old — didn't upstage her parents' TV debut, which is set to air on Tuesday.
But she was mentioned quite a bit as her parents looked for a vacation house that they also could use as a rental property.
"I would say, 'This would be nice for Savanna,' or 'Savanna would like this,' " Stephanie Scibal said during a recent interview in the conference room of her family's Haddonfield real estate office.
Scibal, 30, works with her parents, Bill and Jackie Souders, and brother, Will Souders, in the family business. So Scibal and her husband had no need for a real-estate agent as they checked out three homes on the episode titled "Ocean City Bound with a Baby."
HGTV producers connected with the Scibals on the recommendation of an Ocean City listings broker. But Stephanie took it from there.
"That's why this episode is a little different," Scibal said. "Stephen was essentially my buyer. We were both my buyer ... but I would take him to the listings and open the door just like he would be a buyer, and do the negotiating for us."
Stephen, 33, was a satisfied customer, telling his wife, "I want to buy more houses. That was great, having you as the negotiator."
Couple has many ties to Ocean City Ocean City has a sentimental attachment for the Scibals: It's the first place they met.
Stephen, a medical-device salesman who grew up in Northfield, was a member of the Ocean City Beach Patrol. He and Stephanie met at a lifeguard party when he was 18 and she was 16.
But that was all there was to it, until years later when the two reconnected while both were living in Philly.
After they were married, they returned every weekend to Ocean City, where Stephen's family has a beach house.
"His sisters both have babies, we just had our first baby. We were like, 'It's getting crowded over there,' so that's when we decided to start looking for our own place."
HGTV viewers will likely see Stephen commenting that one of the houses they check out looks familiar.
"When we got there, he realized he had rented it during senior week" back in his lifeguard days, Stephanie said. "That was funny, for him to walk in and have all these memories of having a high school party there."
In a reverse of the typical order, the Scibals shopped for a vacation home before buying a primary residence. They currently rent their Stratford home from Stephanie's parents.
But as a real estate agent who watches trends, Stephanie noted that the New York Times reported on couples buying a second home first in vacation spots such as the Hamptons or the Catskills while continuing to rent in the city.
The Scibals bought their Ocean City home as an investment, so they'll rent it during the peak summer months and stay there before and after the season.
It won't be easy to hand over the keys, Stephanie acknowledged.
"We're falling more and more in love with the house."
All the homes the Scibals looked at for the episode were in Ocean City's north end. Their other home-buying criteria included two to three bedrooms, and at least two bathrooms. They were open to a duplex or a single-family home.
Baby kept crew on tight schedule There were long days of filming the HGTV show, especially for a very pregnant Stephanie.
"It was four days of filming, eight- to 10-hour days in the summer heat, end of September, middle of September," she said.
But Stephanie felt fine as the couple took part in activities around Ocean City, including riding on a Ferris wheel. And she enjoyed a little leisure time on the beach as Stephen surfed.
The fun-in-the-sun vibe is part of what drew the Scibals to buy in Ocean City.
"Something unique about it is that it's a dry town, which makes it a really nice family area," Stephanie said. "You have the boardwalk and really good surfing ... hopefully we show Ocean City in a good light and people will want to visit or buy their own vacation home."
The pregnancy was never far from producers' minds during filming.
"Some of them were like, 'Should we do that scene first?' " Stephanie said, explaining the crew wanted to make sure they had crucial scenes shot in case she went into labor.
Stephanie said the couple didn't have any hesitation about being on camera.
"I guess we're both outgoing people," she said. "It was fun."
Since the Scibals purchased their beachfront bargain, they have been busy with renovations. They even made the property homey for the holidays by putting up a Christmas tree.
They plan to have a watch party when "Beachfront Bargain Hunt" airs on HGTV. But there will be an unavoidable spoiler alert for party guests: The event will be at the Scibals' new Ocean City home, so everyone will know the ending.
Stephanie said she's also eager to someday show the episode to Savanna — who was on board for the episode even if she wasn't on camera.
"I'm excited for her to watch this eventually."

Watch it
Stephanie and Stephen Scibal of Stratford will appear on an episode of HGTV's "Beachfront Bargain Hunt" titled "Ocean City Bound with a Baby." The episode will air at 11 p.m. on Tuesday and will be re-broadcast at 2 a.m. Wednesday.
Filming an episode of an HGTV show was a day at the beach for Stephanie and Stephen Scibel of Stratford.

Texto completo: A group of Covington Catholic High School students are suing CNN, NBC, the Washington Post, nine media personalities and a New York doctor regarding commentary about the incident at the Lincoln Memorial last year.
The group of 12 students filed four separate federal lawsuits and one suit in Kenton County Circuit Court Wednesday.
The federal lawsuits against the media outlets state that the students were defamed, had their privacy invaded and that false coverage led to death threats and personal attacks.
Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann has separately sued the Washington Post, NBC and CNN in the wake of the viral video filmed on Jan. 18, 2019.
Sandmann was 16, and also a student at Covington Catholic High School. He and his classmates were in Washington D.C., for the March for Life.
In the video, he was wearing a red Make America Great Again hat and stood face to face with Nathan Phillips, a Native American activist.
Sandmann did not shout or say anything to Phillips. On video, he does not appear to engage verbally in any way. However, the images of shouting students surrounding Sandmann and Phillips and the interaction between Native Americans and students cast the whole situation in a political light.
The incident received nationwide coverage and created a firestorm on Twitter. As more footage was released, it was revealed that Phillips had approached the teens, not the other way around.
Sandmann is not a party in the lawsuits filed Tuesday.
The 'wanted poster' Unique among the cases is the lawsuit against Sujana Chandrasekhar, whose Twitter account now appears to have been deleted. Chandrasekhar is a New York ear, nose and throat doctor.
The lawsuit claims she posted what the lawyers dubbed a "wanted poster," an image showing the faces of dozens of Covington Catholic students.
Beside the faces is the Covington Catholic High School logo and the words: "Do you know them? The world would like to know too." Chandrasekhar's alleged tweet, accompanying the image, reads: "These are scary faces, indeed. #CovingtonShame."
"Chandrasekhar repeatedly engaged in such a doxing campaign against the Plaintiffs," the lawsuit states.
The lawsuit does not claim that the doctor created the image, but publicized, promoted and popularized it.
Tweets from media personalities The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Kenton County Circuit Court states the students were subjected to "public denunciations, calls for public harassment and public demands of school expulsion."
The media personalities named in the new lawsuit are Jeffrey Shaun King, Kevin Kruse, Reza Aslan, Maggie Haberman, Ana Navarro, Matthew John Dowd, Clara Jeffery, Adam Edelen and Jodi Jacobson.
Most of the lawsuit focuses on tweets posted by the defendants:
King, a Brooklyn-based activist, allegedly said the teens "surrounded and mocked a beloved Native American elder."
According to the lawsuit, Kruse, an author, tweeted that the students mocked Phillips, taunted women and "shouted 'it's not rape if you enjoy it.'"
Azlan, a former CNN commentator, posted a photo of Sandmann and Phillips on Twitter asking if anyone had ever seen a more "punchable" face, according to the suit.
Haberman, a White House correspondent for the New York Times and an analyst for CNN, allegedly tweeted: "Will be interesting to see if anyone is actually expelled, as officials suggest is possible."
Navarro, a commentator on CNN, Telemundo and The View, posted a tweet describing the video as showing a "Native-American elder taunted by racist MAGA-hat wearing teens," according to the suit.
Dowd, an ABC News political analyst, allegedly tweeted: "Let us not let these kids, their parents and their school off the hook."
Jeffery, editor-in-chief of Mother Jones, tweeted that videos showed "Covington Catholic kids: making cavemen gestures at BHI; tomahawk chanting at Natives; taunting random women," the complaint states.
The suit states, Edelen, a former Kentucky politician, retweeted an article "with false factual statements (sic)" about the students and called their behavior "outrageous and abhorrent."
Jacobson, the former editor-in-chief for Rewire.News, is alleged to have written an article containing false statements about the students titled, "White-Washing White Supremacy: Media Rushes to Excuse Covington Catholic Students."
The civil lawsuit states the students were defamed, harassed, threatened and had their privacy invaded among other charges. The students are seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The case has been assigned to Judge Gregory Bartlett.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS, Ohio – Some attorneys say written and recorded sexual consent can be the only way for people to defend themselves against accusations of rape. Advocates say that as a standard, it falls woefully short.
Two Ohio State University football players, Amir Riep, 21, and Jahsen Wint, 21, were arrested last week after being accused of kidnapping and raping a 19-year-old woman.
The next day, head coach Ryan Day announced he dismissed the two from the team.
Columbus police said in an affidavit that Riep told the victim to say the encounter was consensual on a video recording. That recording was recovered, police said.
The idea of seeking "proof" of consent concerns sexual violence researchers and prevention advocates.
Brad Koffel, a Columbus criminal defense attorney in private practice for more than 25 years and managing partner of Koffel Brininger Nesbitt, advises his clients to obtain written consent for sexual acts, even if it's just a text message, or any sort of audio or video recording indicating consent.
"If they don't," he said, "in this climate, then they're going to suffer some consequences."
This month, an attorney defending Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in his trial on rape and sexual assault charges made similar suggestions.
"If I was a man in today's world, before I was engaging in sexual behavior with any woman today, I would ask them to sign a consent form," Donna Rotunno said on The Daily, a New York Times podcast.
Columbus criminal defense attorney Dan Sabol of Sabol Mallory said he would feel concerned if a client obtained written or recorded consent from a sexual partner.
"That'd be a red flag," he said. "It might look as though they're trying to cover their tracks."
Proof of consent might help someone who is falsely accused, Sabol said, but if there is compelling evidence that a sexual act was not consensual, the documentation of consent from a partner could increase the appearance of guilt in a suspect.
"Just because someone says it's consensual on video doesn't make it so," he said.
Sexual assault prevention advocates said they see more instances of young people advised to get proof of consent, but formal documentation in writing or video doesn't capture how consent really works.
"It should be taken as a red flag that a person would have enough doubts about whether or not consent was established to request this type of agreement before or after an encounter," said Laura Palumbo, communication director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.
Emily Gemar, campus advocacy coordinator for OhioHealth's Sexual Assault Response Network of Central Ohio, said consent can legally be revoked at any time.
"If someone consents on a recording one time, it doesn't simply (mean) blanket consent for everything after that," she said.
"On the one hand, people know that consent is important, but on the other hand, of course, these types of ways of proving consent are concerning," said Zo Peterson, director of the Sexual Assault Research Initiative at Indiana University's Kinsey Institute.

Roger Stone judge Jackson looks to have the last word

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has been in the spotlight for the past two years, often criticized by President Donald Trump's supporters and, last week, by the president himself.
Trump's swipe at Jackson, days before the judge is set to decide whether to send Trump's longtime friend and ally to prison – and for how long – opened the floodgates to more attacks. Those in the legal community came to Jackson's defense, exalting not only her independence from public and political pressure but also that of the judiciary.
Thursday, when Roger Stone is set to be sentenced, many eyes will be on Jackson, a former federal prosecutor and daughter of an Army doctor. It will be her moment to show that at a time of entrenched partisanship, the third branch of government doesn't succumb to political pressure, said Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., who recommended Jackson to the federal bench in 2011.
"She has got to essentially, using this case, vindicate the judiciary system itself, to show that it is entirely independent," Norton said.
Jackson has presided over many of the criminal cases that sprouted from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, including several that involved Trump's closest aides and associates.
The case against Stone, who was found guilty of seven crimes, including lying to Congress, proved to be the most contentious. What began as a standard Justice Department process of recommending a prison sentence for a defendant erupted into a political crisis in one week as Trump tweeted persistently about the agency's prosecution of his allies.
In the days leading up to Stone's sentencing, the Justice Department caused an uproar after it intervened to reduce its prosecutors' recommendation of up to nine years in prison for the 67-year-old political operative. Four career prosecutors withdrew from the case. One resigned from the Justice Department.
U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, the chief judge in the court where Jackson serves, issued a rare public statement defending how sentences are decided. "Public criticism or pressure is not a factor," she said. An association of federal judges held an emergency meeting to discuss concerns about political interference in criminal cases.
By Tuesday, news outlets reported that Attorney General William Barr considered resigning his post amid a dispute over the president's tweets criticizing the Justice Department.
Whatever the events that dominated the news cycle over the past week, "the ball really stops in the judge's court," Norton said, citing a Supreme Court ruling that gave judges discretion over imposing sentences.
"She can do anything she wants to do," Norton said of Jackson, "and that is exactly what I expect her to do."
Before the federal bench
Jackson, 65, was born in Baltimore. Her father was a Korean War veteran who served in the Army medical corps. Her mother, as she said during her confirmation hearing in 2011, raised her in a household where she was "blissfully unaware that there was anything that I couldn't do when I grew up as long as I got off the phone and did my homework."
She lauded her grandparents who came to the USA on a boat "with nothing, to escape oppression." She wore her grandmother's necklace to "remember the woman who came here, learned the language, became a citizen, was a suffragette, raised three daughters and ran a business."
Jackson studied at Harvard College and Harvard Law. She spent the first years of her career as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, where she handled high-profile murder and sexual assault cases. She switched to private practice, handling white-collar cases and civil litigation.
During the mid-1990s, Jackson took a leave from her practice to care for her family. She and her ex-husband, a former Department of Commerce assistant secretary under President George W. Bush, have two sons.
Jackson returned to work in 2000. A few years later, she and two law partners defended former Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., who was charged with fraud and bribery. The case grabbed headlines after the FBI discovered $90,000 in cash hidden in Jefferson's freezer. A firestorm erupted after the FBI raided the lawmaker's congressional office, raising constitutional questions about whether the materials confiscated were privileged.
She and her partners sought to keep the records from becoming public. President Bush stepped in and ordered that the documents be kept private.
"It's not every day that a lawyer gets his motion granted by the president of the United States," Jackson told partner Robert Trout, who recounted the conversation during an oral history interview for the Historical Society of the District of Columbia Circuit.
'I am a real person'
During her confirmation hearing for the federal bench, Jackson was asked about judicial temperament.
"Obviously, I have not served as a judge, but I would hope that what my background investigation has revealed is that of all the many things that can be said about me, that I am a real person and I relate to other people from all walks of life," Jackson said.
"And I think that ability to connect and to understand will inform my judging, hopefully, inform my temperament and help me achieve the goal that I have, which is to rule efficiently, because I think people are waiting for your rulings, and to rule clearly, because I think people need to understand them," she said.
The Senate confirmed Jackson 97-0.
As a judge, Jackson delivers long explanations of her thinking before she imposes a sentence. During the sentencing hearing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort last year, Jackson gave a withering rebuke of the political operative.
"Saying I'm sorry I got caught is not an inspiring plea for leniency," she said.
Manafort's defense attorney criticized her comments.
"The judge displayed a level of callousness and hostility that I have not seen before," Kevin Downing said outside the courthouse.
Jackson's judicial record
Critics of Jackson accuse her of bias against Trump and his associates, noting that she was appointed by President Barack Obama.
Her defenders point to her judicial record, saying her rulings have been both friendly and hostile to both sides of the aisle.
In 2012, she ruled that the Obama administration overstepped its authority in revoking the permit of a coal mining company. That same year, a New York Times editorial praised her for striking down regulations that allowed some groups to hide their campaign donors.
In 2016, she rejected the Obama administration's claim of executive privilege to block a congressional committee from obtaining records related to a bungled gun-trafficking investigation code-named Fast and Furious.
She dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit in 2017 brought against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by families of two Americans who were killed in 2012 in an attack in Benghazi, Libya. Larry Klayman, the families' attorney, called the ruling "intellectually dishonest" and accused Jackson of protecting Clinton.
Ruth Kassinger, who has known Jackson since they were in eighth grade in Baltimore, defended her friend.
"I think her judicial record is one of fair mindedness. It is impossible that she would act in any way contrary to her duty to impartiality," Kassinger said in an email to USA TODAY. "Impossible – that's just who she is."
It would also be impossible to know Jackson "without being aware of her quick humor and her delight in musical theater," Kassinger said.
During a ceremony in 2013 for former Chief Judge Royce Lamberth, a group of new judges performed a skit teasing the judge over his love for Texas, his home state.
Jackson, wearing a purple dress and a cowboy hat, sang a parody rendition of Frank Sinatra's "My Way."

Pa. Sinfonia to feature soprano Fiona Gillespie

Texto completo: It will feel like an afternoon in Vienna (well, almost) Sunday, Feb. 23, when members of the Pennsylvania Sinfonia Orchestra present "A Viennese Afternoon," featuring music of Mozart and Haydn at Christ Lutheran Church in Allentown.
Special guest is concert soloist and folk musician Fiona Gillespie, a much sought-after vocalist who has made numerous appearances with local groups and early music ensembles across the country.
On the program will be Mozart's Divertimento in D Major, K. 136, his delightful "Exsultate, jubilate," K. 165, which will feature Gillespie as soloist, and Haydn's Symphony No. 78 in C Minor in its first performance by the Sinfonia in its 37 years.
Gillespie, who teaches voice and opera workshop at Muhlenberg College, has performed with numerous area organizations, including the Bach Choir of Bethlehem, the Pennsylvania Sinfonia, the Reading Symphony Orchestra, and the Berks Sinfonietta, among numerous others. She recently sung the role of Mary in Respighi's "Laud to the Nativity" at the Bach Choir of Bethlehem's Christmas concerts, and appeared at Cathedral Church a couple of years back with the her NYC/PA-based band, The Chivalrous Crickets.
The Bethlehem native is much in demand - in one week alone, Gillespie appeared with the Grammy Award-winning Cleveland-based early music group Apollo's Fire before heading to New York City on Christmas Day to perform at Christ and St. Stephen's Episcopal Church.
Mozart's absolutely gorgeous "Exsultate, jubilate," believe it or not, came from the pen of a 16-year-old Mozart. And the man (yes, man!) for whom Mozart wrote it was the famous countertenor Venanzio Rauzzini, the Italian castrato hailed by the musical world of Milan.
Mozart's youth at the time of the work's composition completely belies the sound of the piece. To many, it's the sound of a genius at the peak of his powers, harnessing some of the finest slices of his imagination. Today this stunning work is a favorite of sopranos the world over, especially its final-movement Alleluia, in which just that one word is set to music. One shudders to think what Mozart would have been doing instead of composing had he been born in this age - playing video games on his Xbox?
Haydn's Symphony No. 78 was part of a trilogy that, including Symphonies Nos. 76 and 77, were to accompany him to a visit to England, a trip that never took place. The No. 78 is a somber, haunting essay in an overall stern rather than festive mood. In many ways it foreshadows Brahms' deep broodings. Yet happily in later years his symphonies would assume the humor and vigor of a man half his age.
Pennsylvania Sinfonia, 4 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 23, Christ Lutheran Church, 1245 W. Hamilton St., Allentown. Tickets: adults $35, $25; seniors $30, $20; students free. 610 434-7811, www.pasinfonia.org
Takács Quartet at Williams Center
The 16 string quartets of Ludwig van Beethoven are among the most richly expressive examples of the genre ever penned. The quartets of Opus 18 are thought to demonstrate his total mastery of the classical string quartet as developed by Haydn and Mozart; the next three, or the Razumovsky Quartets, greatly expanded the form and incorporated a new degree of emotional sensitivity and drama.
Finally, the late quartets, which group includes Beethoven's last five quartets, are the composer's last completed works. These works are widely considered to be among the greatest musical compositions ever written.
In observance of the 250th anniversary of Beethoven's birth, the renowned Takács String Quartet returns to the Williams Center for the Arts at Lafayette College in Easton Wednesday, Feb. 26 to present a survey of works from each period. On the program are the String Quartets No. 6 in B-flat major, Opus 18; the No. 9 in C major, Opus 59, No. 3; and the No. 16 in F major, Opus 135, the last complete piece Beethoven ever wrote.
The Takács Quartet, now entering its 45th season, is renowned for the vitality of its interpretations. Hailed as "arguably the greatest string quartet in the world" by The Guardian, the group performs nearly 80 concerts a year worldwide, maintaining an active career in Europe as well as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Korea.
The resident ensemble at the University of Colorado since 1983, the group was formed in 1975 at the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest by Gabor Takács-Nagy, Károly Schranz, Gabor Ormai and András Fejér, while all four were students. Group members include violinists Edward Dusinberre and Harumi Rhodes, violist Geraldine Walther, and cellist András Fejér.
Markus Dubischar, associate dean of the curriculum and associate professor of classics, will present a pre-concert talk 7 p.m. in Room 108 of the Williams Center the evening of the concert.
Takács String Quartet, 8 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 26, Williams Center for the Arts, Lafayette College, Easton. Tickets: $30 adults, $6 youth and students. 610-330-5009, www.williamscenter.lafayette.edu
Apollo's Fire at Kutztown University
Named for the classical god of music, healing and the sun, the Grammy Award-winning ensemble Apollo's Fire has been igniting the hearts of critics and period music fans since its inception. Its performances have been called "resplendent" by the New York Times, "as exciting as Baroque music gets" from Chicago Classical Review, and "arguably one of best period-instrument ensembles in the world" by the Sarasota Herald Tribune.
On Tuesday, Feb. 25, Apollo's Fire comes to the Schaefer Auditorium at Kutztown University in an all-Vivaldi program featuring "The Four Seasons," the stormy Concerto for Two Cellos, and Sorrell's own arrangement of "La Folia," which the orchestra plays entirely from memory.
Founded in 1992 by award-winning harpsichordist and conductor Jeannette Sorrell, the group has built one of the largest audiences of any baroque orchestra in North America, sold out concerts in Carnegie Hall, London's BBC Proms, Tanglewood and Ravinia, and released over two dozen CDs, including 8 bestsellers on the Billboard classical chart.
Apollo's Fire, 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 25, Schaeffer Auditorium on the Kutztown University campus, Kutztown. Tickets: $38, $34 for students and seniors. 610-683-4092, www.KutztownPresents.org
Lehigh University Philharmonic
The 11th annual Lehigh University Concerto Marathon, presented by the students of the LU Philharmonic, takes place Friday, Feb. 21 and Saturday, Feb. 22 at the Zoellner Arts Center in Bethlehem. This annual event features student soloists and full orchestral works, all under the direction of Eugene Albulescu, director of the LU Philharmonic.
On the program this year will be Mendelssohn's "Hebrides" Overture and Grieg's "Peer Gynt" Suite No. 1, two of the most popular works in the orchestral repertoire.
Perhaps no work and no surrounding landscape were as equally matched for compositional success as Mendelssohn's trip to Scotland and the writing of his "Hebrides" Overture. Completed in 1833, Mendelssohn stated "It is in pictures, ruins, and natural surroundings that I find the most music."
Second to Grieg's Piano Concerto, the Peer Gynt Suite No.1, completed in 1888, is the composer's most popular work, and of its four movements, "Morning" and "In the Hall of the Mountain King" are among the most loved of all short orchestral compositions.
Lehigh University Philharmonic, 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, Feb. 21 and 22, Baker Hall, Zoellner Arts Center, Lehigh University campus, Bethlehem. Tickets: $12 general admission. 610-758-2787, www.zoellnerartscenter.org

Saying farewell to women's reproductive rights?

Texto completo: You can't have it both ways: cutting off access to contraceptives and also cutting off access to abortion services. If decreasing the need for legal and safe abortion is what you want, then common sense says that you have to support access to family planning.
Abortion is never going to "go away." It has been part of human history since at least 1500 BCE.
No birth control method is 100% effective but having access to no methods at all invites thousands of unwanted pregnancies. Such is the current situation in many parts of the U.S., now that Title X funding that provides reproductive health services to poor women is no longer available to many family planning clinics that refuse to abide by a new Trump administration dictum banning abortion services or referrals.
To understand the impact of this cruel requirement, look only to the results of health care offered by family planning clinics supported by Title X. According to the Guttmacher Institute, Title X funding helped prevent more than 822,000 unintended pregnancies in 2015.
For those concerned about spending tax dollars wisely, the institute estimated that for every dollar the federal government spends on family planning, it saves $7.
Now the federal government is providing funding to faith-based groups that claim the ability to take over services once offered by Planned Parenthood. In Texas, these "clinics" have served "many fewer patients than were seen by Planned Parenthood," according to an editorial in the New York Times by Andrea Grimes, a journalist and activist.
Those who depend on Medicaid had to seek care at providers with no experience. Indeed, their managers find certain services "morally repugnant," including hormonal contraception, sexually transmitted disease treatments for unmarried couples and fertility and adoption counseling for LGBTQ individuals. So much for practicing science-based medicine and for being nondiscriminatory.
In Ohio, two clinics were forced to close after losing their Title X funding; neither provides abortions, but apparently they do refer patients for abortion services. One of these two clinics has served its community since 1977, helping thousands of women prevent unwanted pregnancies, thus reducing the need for abortions.
In Missouri, only one clinic remains, and it is on shaky ground thanks to Missouri legislators. Soon, Missouri women needing reproductive health care will be forced to travel to Illinois. Many of those women don't have the means to travel back and forth. Now they'll be denied health care.
The New York Times also reports that members of the Trump administration are opposed to birth control. In fact, one of the three new recipients of Title X funding is a Catholic-affiliated group that solely offers guidance on the extremely unreliable rhythm method.
This is just the beginning of a concerted effort by the Trump administration to eliminate effective family planning, including abortion care. Other clinics throughout the U.S. will have to close soon, and the people who will be most adversely affected will be those who can least afford an unwanted pregnancy, or who can least afford other vital services, including sexually transmitted disease testing, breast exams and Pap smears to detect cervical cancer. They will be forced to go to clinics that do not practice science-based medicine, but rather rely on what their faith dictates.
This is the 21st century, and we are still dealing with organizations, both governmental and private, that refuse to acknowledge the effectiveness of scientifically proven, fact-based medicine. And, as one obstetrician-gynecologist remarked, why is it so rare that the needs of the people truly inform the laws that govern them?
The lack of regard concerning science-based medicine is now even insinuating itself in cruel and baseless laws that dictate either no abortion period, or no abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. Before six weeks, many women don't even know they're pregnant.
Recently Alabama signed into law a near total ban on abortion, with no exceptions even for rape or incest. Through March 2019, Georgia, Kentucky and Mississippi banned access to abortion at six weeks. Missouri, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee are ready to do the same, while other states have filed proposals for similar bans.
Surveys consistently show that more than 70% of Americans want abortion to remain safe, legal and accessible. So much for legislators listening to or truly representing the wishes of their constituents.
And now, more than ever, as momentum builds for the 2020 election, we must continue to fight to ensure every single person can access the care they need to live the life they desire. I therefore urge you to use your voice, your wallet, and your vote.
Speak up and share your views with your elected representatives at the state and federal levels. Donate to causes that deliver important, necessary reproductive and sexuality health care, such as Planned Parenthood, and vote on April 28 and Nov. 3.

U.S. News: Bloomberg Hires Social-Media Army

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign is hiring hundreds of workers in California to post regularly on their personal social-media accounts in support of the candidate and send text messages to their friends about him.
The effort, which could cost millions of dollars, is launching ahead of California's March 3 primary and could later be deployed nationwide, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. It is among the most unorthodox moves yet by the heavy-spending billionaire and blurs the line between traditional campaign organizing and the distribution of sponsored content.
Most campaigns encourage supporters to post on social media about their candidates, but paying them at this scale to do so on their personal accounts is unusual, experts say.
A California staffer and the documents reviewed by the Journal describe a multimillion-dollar-a-month effort aimed at helping Mr. Bloomberg attract support after he entered the race months behind his rivals. The documents say the campaign is adopting a strategy, which it says the Trump campaign used effectively, to try to influence potential voters through people they know and trust rather than relying on outreach from strangers.
To staff the effort, the campaign is hiring more than 500 "deputy digital organizers" to work 20 to 30 hours a week and receive $2,500 a month, the documents show. Those workers are expected to promote Mr. Bloomberg weekly to everyone in their phones' contacts by text message and make daily social-media posts supporting him, the documents show.
"The Fight for Equal Rights Has Been One of the Great Fights of Mike's Life," reads one suggested prompt regarding Mr. Bloomberg's early support for same-sex marriage.
President Trump's reelection campaign includes staff dedicated to digital media but doesn't compensate people to post on their personal social media accounts, a campaign spokeswoman said.
Helping organize the effort is Outvote, an app that lets users send pre-written texts, post campaign materials to social media and send data back to campaigns. The app, funded by Higher Ground Labs, a Democratic political technology incubator, generally focuses on pushing volunteers to distribute content. Outvote also allows users to look up whether their friends have voted in past elections by matching their contact lists with public data.
A spokeswoman for the campaign characterized the strategy as the future of political organizing. "We are meeting voters everywhere on any platform that they consume their news," a campaign spokeswoman said. "One of the most effective ways of reaching voters is by activating their friends and network."
While Facebook Inc.'s policies historically have treated political advertising and influencer marketing as separate spheres, the company recently has begun to grapple with the intersection of the two.
It isn't clear whether messages like those the Bloomberg campaign is suggesting would require labeling as sponsored content under Facebook's disclosure rules. A Facebook spokeswoman said posts by "content creators" would need labels if a campaign paid for them, but that posts by campaign staffers wouldn't. The company didn't address how it would categorize posts by employees paid to promote content to their personal networks.
A review by the Journal of social-media posts by some people being paid by the campaign found they aren't labeled as sponsored content.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has said that merely tagging a brand or business on social media is a form of endorsement that falls under its purview -- and should be disclosed if an audience would see the message differently knowing that an influencer had benefited financially.
The Bloomberg campaign spokeswoman said posts from its deputy field organizers wouldn't need to be labeled, describing them as a form of political organizing rather than paid influencer content.
Political campaigns have long used a combination of volunteers and paid workers to do things like run phone banks and knock on doors. But experts said the Bloomberg campaign's willingness to pay to leverage supporters' existing social connections is novel.
James Thurber, professor of government at American University, said groups promoting political issues sometimes use similar strategies, but it is unusual from a candidate. "It's classic AstroTurf tactics," he said, referring to political efforts backed by powerful individuals or lobbying groups but designed to appear grass-roots. "When you have unlimited resources the way Bloomberg seems to, you can do that."
At least until recently, the Bloomberg campaign also planned to recruit another 2,500 campaign "digital organizing fellows" who would be paid $500 a month to post daily on social media and put every person in their contact list into the campaign's database, according to documents reviewed by the Journal and a deputy organizer who was told to expect to oversee five such fellows.
The spokeswoman said that the campaign had decided not to proceed with the fellows, and had changed the title of the $2,500-a-month deputy digital roles to "deputy field organizer" to reflect that the role might also include more traditional campaign activities.
Mr. Bloomberg's spending has helped lift his standing in polls, enabling him to qualify for Wednesday's Democratic debate.
Since declaring his candidacy late last year, Mr. Bloomberg has exceeded the combined advertising spending of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
The Bloomberg campaign also recently worked with an offshoot of media and marketing company Jerry Media to contract with large meme accounts to push the campaign, the New York Times has reported, leading Facebook last week to clarify its rules around such posts.
The Bloomberg campaign will suggest content for sharing and exert some control over the social-media outreach efforts, according to the documents reviewed by the Journal. Though the campaign won't have direct access to or authority over organizers' social-media accounts, a team of quality-control staff will monitor their posts.
"Ha! Even Republicans think Mike is our best bet to defeat Trump! Let's prove them right," said one suggested message for text or social media, linking to a news article citing conservative political operatives bullish about Mr. Bloomberg's chances.

Texto completo: The Wolves are just warming up. Soon they'll be ready to pounce.
Starting Friday, the play "The Wolves" gets its regional premiere at Pittsburgh Playhouse, with Point Park's Conservatory Theatre students playing members of a high school girls indoor soccer team, who have a lot to say while gearing up for games.
Point Park alumna Rachel Stevens (Front Porch Theatricals' "Floyd Collins"; Quantum Theatre's "The Hard Problem") directs a play that is an obvious predecessor to "Dance Nation," seen last year at barebones productions - both are no-holds-barred explorations of female adolescence. For Point Park, the authenticity of language isn't the only way Stevens hopes to keep it real. The Pioneers' men's soccer team developed the moves for their fellow students, who converse about everything from murderous dictators to feminine products as they stretch before a series of games.
The New York Times' Ben Brantley bestowed extravagant praise when he reviewed the NYC premiere of "The Wolves" in 2016. "The scary, exhilarating brightness of raw adolescence emanates from every scene of this uncannily assured first play by Sarah DeLappe," he wrote.
Stevens found "The Wolves" irresistible when it was offered as a return to her alma mater and her first time working in the Playhouse's new Downtown digs.
"Every facet of this play appeals to me," the director says. She feels a kindred with these adolescent girls who are frustrated by adult perceptions while also "finding their own footing and still trying be heard and seen fully. So I am really honored to be able to help champion that with actors who are so close to these characters' ages."
Stevens graduated from Point Park in 2009 and got her master's degree in directing at the Actors Studio Drama School in 2014. She has been an assistant director to Tony winner Rachel Chavkin, but these days, Stevens has focused mostly on new play development.
When "The Wolves" was suggested for her Point Park return, she immediately embraced its musicality and movement, along with its "collaboration and teamwork - things that I am the most passionate about when it comes to building theater overall."
"And," she continues, "this story is about how to find your individual voice while still honoring the unity of the team, so I really fell in love with the structure of this piece."
"The Wolves" is Point Park's first Conservatory Theatre production since "The Adding Machine" was jettisoned and March show "Parade" was replaced by "Pippin" amid charges of racial insensi-tivity. Before arriving on campus, Stevens was aware of the goings-on from afar.
Her approach going into this production are the same as any work she does in a university setting: "To provide a safe place to collaborate, to speak our minds and to cherish where the students are in their process."
Highmark Theatre, Pittsburgh Playhouse, 350 Forbes Ave., Downtown. Friday through March 8; www.pittsburghplayhouse.com or 412-392-8000.
'Into the Woods' at CMU
The Stephen Sondheim musical "Into the Woods" will be directed and choreographed by Carnegie Mellon University alumnus Matthew Gardiner, the associate artistic director of the award-winning Signature Theatre in Arlington, Va. His work in Washington, D.C., includes premieres of "The Laramie Project" and "Caroline, or Change."
Rick Edinger is musical director for the show that puts a Sondheim/James Lapine twist on morality, family and fairy tales, and things that happen halfway through the woods.

President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he has named Richard Grenell, a staunch loyalist, as acting spy chief.
"I am pleased to announce that our highly respected Ambassador to Germany, @RichardGrenell, will become the Acting Director of National Intelligence. Rick has represented our Country exceedingly well and I look forward to working with him," Mr. Trump tweeted.
Mr. Trump also thanked outgoing acting director Joseph Maguire "for the wonderful job he has done, and we look forward to working with him closely, perhaps in another capacity within the Administration!"
News of the selection, which was first reported by The New York Times, comes as Mr. Trump faces a March 11 deadline to nominate a new director of national intelligence or name a new acting spy chief as federal law prevents Mr. Maguire from serving beyond that date.
Even in an acting role, Mr. Grenell's lack of intelligence-related experience is likely to unsettle the U.S. intelligence community, which has endured repeated attacks from the president.
THIRD TEEN ARRESTED IN COLLEGE STUDENT'S DEATH
A third teen allegedly involved in the stabbing death of Barnard College student Tessa Majors turned himself in to authorities in New York on Wednesday morning, according to a law enforcement official.
The 14-year-old faces charges of second-degree murder and first-degree robbery, the official said.
He was arraigned later on Wednesday. He will be charged as an adult but would face juvenile sentencing guidelines, the official said.
Majors, 18, was walking in Manhattan's Morningside Park near Barnard on Dec. 11 when she was attacked, NYPD said.
U. OF MICH. INVESTIGATES DOCTOR ABUSE CLAIMS
ANN ARBOR, Mich. - Five former patients have alleged that a late University of Michigan physician sexually abused them during exams, with one accuser saying Dr. Robert E. Anderson's actions over several decades made him a "sexual predator."
A spokesman acknowledged that some university employees were aware of accusations against the doctor prior to a 2018 complaint that led to a police investigation.
Anderson, the former director of the University Health Service, was a team physician for various sports at Michigan from 1966 until his retirement in 2003. He died in 2008.
RAPPER POP SMOKE FATALLY SHOT, SAYS LABEL
LOS ANGELES - Pop Smoke, a rising Brooklyn rapper who had a breakout year of hit songs and albums that made some of the biggest names in hip-hop his fans and collaborators, was fatally shot during a break-in Wednesday at a Hollywood Hills home, his label said.
"We are devastated by the unexpected and tragic loss of Pop Smoke," said a statement from Republic Records, the label of the 20-year-old whose legal name was Bashar Barakah Jackson.
Los Angeles police did not immediately confirm the identification and have not announced any arrests.

Texto completo: James Baldwin had always known that he was smart. But growing up poor in Harlem, during times of racial inequality made it difficult for him to envision his future.
"I knew I was black, of course, but I also knew I was smart. I didn't know how I would use my mind, or even if I could, but that was the only thing I had to use," he said. Born in 1924, Baldwin had a childhood that lacked peace because of his stepfather, a cruel man who mistreated him while favoring his younger brothers and sisters. And so, Baldwin spent much of his childhood in solitude, thumbing through the pages of books inside his neighborhood library.
At age 13, he wrote his first article, which was published in his school's newspaper when he was living in Harlem. His teachers deemed him gifted at an early age, but it took a few more years before Baldwin would realize that his talent and intelligence could lead him to a path of success. It wasn't until he met painter Beau-ford Delaney that he realized that a black person could be an artist.
As a child and as a teenager, Baldwin was harassed and tortured by police on two separate occasions. His stepfather died in 1943. The funeral was the same day as Baldwin's 19th birthday and the same day as the Harlem Riot of 1943. He used these moments to shape his writing and his views of race relations in the United States.
Baldwin was a prolific novelist and essayist, and his work is often described as painting a much-needed picture of the pain that African Americans felt leading up to the civil rights movement. But Baldwin's work did more than that.
With a daring pen and the desire to see the world differently, Baldwin wrote stories that spoke to the underdog in many forms. In his novels "Another Country," which was published in 1962, and "Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone" (1968), his writing explored themes of sexual identity as well as race.
After graduating from high school, Baldwin worked odd jobs to support his family. At every turn, Baldwin experienced discrimination when at restaurants and bars, and he was eventually fired from a job in New Jersey where he laid railroad tracks for the U.S. Army.
This led him to Greenwich Village, which has been described as a bohemian arts district in New York City, where he was able to obtain a literary apprenticeship. His skill and eloquence with writing was mostly self-taught, and in 1948, Baldwin left for France, hoping to be able to feel more like a person than he had in America.
"Once I found myself on the other side of the ocean, I see where I came from very clearly I am the grandson of a slave, and I am a writer. I must deal with both," Baldwin once told The New York Times in 1985. In Paris, he focused on his writing and published such works as "Go Tell It on the Mountain" and "Giovanni's Room."
Between the two novels came a collection of essays, "Notes of a Native Son" (1955), which detailed the black experience in America. After having lived in France for eight years, Baldwin returned to the U.S. and became a prolific figure in the fight for civil rights. He was moved by an image of Dorothy Counts, who braved a mob to desegregate schools in Charlotte, North Carolina. His editor at the time pushed him to return to the U.S. to provide insight on what was happening in the American South.
Baldwin made the trip back to the U.S. and conducted interviews throughout Charlotte and Montgomery, Alabama. Shortly after, Baldwin's work started to receive more mainstream attention, and Time featured him on the cover of its May 17, 1963, issue. "There is not another writer," wrote Time, "who expresses with such poignancy and abrasiveness the dark realities of the racial ferment in North and South."
In 1987, Baldwin died from stomach cancer in France, but his legacy and his works continue to live on. His novel "If Beale Street Could Talk" was adapted into a feature film in 2018 and was nominated for three Golden Globes and three Oscars (Regina King won a Globe and an Oscar for best supporting actress), and his work and insight into the black American experience are still referenced to this day.

MODERN COOKING VIETNAMESE: Vietnamese cuisine made easy: Chef Nicole Routhier, part of team behind Le Colonial in Atlanta, shares some recipes.

Texto completo: Nicole Routhier may not be a very familiar name in current culinary circles. But the French Vietnamesechef, cookbookauthor, and teacher has long been considered an authority on Vietnamese cuisine.And since 1993, Routhier has had a hand in developing menus for multiple Le Colonial restaurants, including the new location at the Shops Buckhead Atlanta.
Routhier grew up in Saigon, where her mother was a cook, and studied in Belgium and France, before moving to New York City, and then Houston, where she lives now. When I met her during the opening of Le Colonial in Atlanta last year, she noted that Vietnamese food wasn't well known in the U.S. when she wrote her first cookbook.
"I was way ahead of the curve, 30 years ago,"Routhier said. "That was at the time when there were barely any cookbooks on Vietnamese cuisine. There was nobody teaching people how to cook Vietnamese food at home. I said, 'I'm going to be the one,' because I was so passionate about it, and this is a cuisine that people should know about. So I just wrote what I knew, the food I grew up with, and I just happened to make a career out of cooking."
Routhier graduated from the Culinary Institute of America at Hyde Park, New York, in 1985. And shortly before that, then-New York Times food editor Craig Claiborne wrote an effusive story about Routhier's cooking, with the headline "The flavors of Vietnam re-created in America."
Routhier's "The Foods of Vietnam" was published in 1989, and won the Julia Child Award for Best American Cookbook from the International Association of Culinary Professionals. Two more acclaimed cookbooks followed: 1994's "Cooking Under Wraps" and 1996's "Nicole Routhier's Fruit Cookbook."
Recently, I asked Routhier if she would consider sharing some of her recipes for home cooks. She not only said yes, but traveled to Atlanta, whereshepreparedseveral dishes in the Le Colonial kitchen.
Then we sat down in the dining room to taste and talk about each one, including a Spicy and Sour Shrimp Soup with Pineapple, Salmon Braised in Ginger Caramel Sauce served with pickled vegetables, and a favorite Banana Tapioca Pudding.
"I don't really create anything from scratch, because I prefer to work from heirloom and classic dishes,"Routhier said. "The Spicy and Sour Shrimp Soup is not something that I invented, but the flavors are to my taste. This dish is from South Vietnam, where they have pineapple plantations, and they are so sweet. And I chose to use okra because I know people in Georgia love it, and we love okra in Vietnam, too."
Speaking about the salmon dish, Routhier said, "Braised fish is very old and classic. It's something that my mother made almost every other day. It's a go-to dish for most homecooks, becauseyoucanmake a large amount and reheat it. I prefer fish, but my mother would cut pieces of chicken or pork or sometimes pork ribs. The marinade is very unique. You make a caramel with brown sugar and then you add fish sauce to it. The sauce is sweet and salty, so you need to balance it with something sour or acidic like pickled vegetables."
Banana Tapioca Pudding is another dish from Routhier's childhood memories, but she put her own spin on it when she developed the recipe.
"As a child, this was my favorite dessert," she said. "We have street vendors, and each one of them specializes in one specific dish. In the afternoon, after I came back from school, it was our tea time, and I would eagerly await the chants of the vendors with the banana pudding. Mine is very basic. It's tapioca, coconut milk, sugar and bananas cooked up together. But what goes after makes it special. We serve it with toasted sesame seeds, for a little crunch, and I elevated it a little bit by caramelizing the bananas."
Routhierhasbeenteachingcookingclassesforyears, andknowsthat tackling Vietnamese cuisine can be intimidating for many people.
"My job is to make it less intimidating," she said. "But I insist on having hands-on classes, because that's the only way that people can learn how the textures work, how fresh the ingredients are, and how things taste together. My first job is to help them understand the ingredients, where to find them, and give them options when they can't find certain ingredients. Vietnamese cuisine made easy for the home cook is how I approach it."

Texto completo: Taika Waititi's Oscar winner is available to rent on many streaming platforms. And a new basketball documentary series is on Crackle.
What's Streaming
JOJO RABBIT (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "Remember that joke Kate Winslet has in 'Extras,' where she says you'd better make a Holocaust film if you want an Oscar?" Taika Waititi asked in an interview with The New York Times last year. "People might think that's kind of true, but there was never in my mind any reality where this film was going to be part of that conversation." He was talking about "Jojo Rabbit," the satire he wrote and directed, which had become an unlikely awards-season contender and would win him an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. The movie, based a novel by Christine Leunens, follows Johannes (Roman Griffin Davis), a 10-year-old in Nazi Germany whose imaginary best friend is Adolf Hitler (Waititi) and whose mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), is hiding a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their house. The film "risks going wrong in a dozen different ways," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, "and manages to avoid at least half of them."
THE CALL OF THE WILD (1972) Stream on Amazon and Tubi. Harrison Ford returns to theaters this weekend in a new adaptation of "The Call of the Wild," Jack London's 1903 novel about an outdoorsman and a dog. This earlier adaptation casts Charlton Heston in the lead role (the human one). Those curious to compare Heston's and Ford's takes might revisit it, but beware: Heston once called this film "the worst movie I ever made."
ON POINT Stream on Crackle. Guest appearances by the N.B.A. players Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Zion Williamson add a bit of celebrity might to this amateur basketball documentary series -- but if the young players in the show have their dreams fulfilled, they'll become stars, too. "On Point" follows high schoolers playing A.A.U. basketball. Reminiscent of shows like "Last Chance U," it follows them on the court and off.
PLAYING FOR KEEPS Stream on Sundance Now. Those who prefer their sports with a side of murder-mystery can turn to this Australian series, which centers on the wives and girlfriends of a group of fictional Australian soccer players. Their flashy lives might be enviable to some -- but the death of a player brings unsettling mystery and media scrutiny.
What's on TV
THE UPSIDE (2019) 6 p.m. on Showtime 2. The 2012 French dramedy "The Intouchables," about an unlikely friendship between an uptight aristocrat with paraplegia and an employee, was a box-office sensation overseas. This Hollywood remake stars Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart. It keeps the main relationship the same (Cranston plays the rich man) but moves the action to New York. "Some squinting will be required to block out the race and class stereotyping, as well as the puddles of sentiment scattered throughout the highly predictable plot," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times. "Yet Jon Hartmere's script has genuinely funny moments and is blessedly short on crassness: even a scene involving catheters and colon hygiene is less cringey than you might expect."

Fed Saw Outbreak as Danger to Growth

Texto completo: Chair Jerome H. Powell and his colleagues discussed the potential economic effects of the virus and lower bank capital at their last meeting, a recap released Wednesday showed.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials left interest rates unchanged at their January meeting as the economy grew steadily, but they spent their meeting reviewing risks to the outlook -- including fresh concerns about the coronavirus that had begun to take hold in China.
Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's Jan. 28 and 29 meeting showed that officials called the new coronavirus "a new risk to the global growth outlook." At the time, the outbreak had killed more than 100 people and sickened about 5,000. It has continued to spread since, causing more than 2,000 deaths and infecting more than 75,000 people.
Central bankers have been cautious about predicting how much the virus will affect the United States economy, though they have made it clear that they expect some spillover. Swaths of China have ground to a standstill as authorities try to contain the virus by shuttering factories and enforcing quarantines, disrupting trade and tourism. Factories across the nation are reopening, but haltingly.
The Fed is monitoring how the economic fallout in China bears on American growth and inflation.
"The question for us really is: What will be the effects on the U.S. economy? Will they be persistent, will they be material?" Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, told lawmakers while testifying last week. "We know that there will be some, very likely to be some effects on the United States. I think it's just too early to say."
Fed officials have signaled that they plan to leave policy unchanged as they wait to see how the economy shapes up in 2020. That patient stance comes after central bankers cut interest rates three times last year in a bid to insulate the economy against fallout from President Trump's trade war and a slowdown abroad.
While an initial trade deal with China has alleviated some uncertainty that dogged America's economy last year, tensions are not fully resolved. Beyond that, manufacturing remains slow and business investment is still weak.
"Participants generally expected trade-related uncertainty to remain somewhat elevated, and they were mindful of the possibility that the tentative signs of stabilization in global growth could fade," according to the January minutes. Against that backdrop, they saw the current policy as "likely to remain appropriate for a time."
Interest rates are currently set in a range between 1.5 and 1.75 percent. That is below the Fed's longer-run estimate of where its rate will settle, and officials believe the current stance should give the economy a slight boost.
The central bank's next meeting will take place March 17 and 18 in Washington. Since the January gathering, Fed officials have consistently signaled that they remain comfortable leaving rates unchanged for now, unless an economic surprise knocks them off that course.
Coronavirus is not the only risk on the Fed's radar.
Some Fed officials fretted over financial stability risks at the meeting, noting that "financial imbalances -- including overvaluation and excessive indebtedness -- could amplify an adverse shock to the economy."
And "several" pointed out that "planned increases in dividend payouts by large banks and the associated decline in capital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to weather adverse shocks."
But the minutes also suggest a paradox for regulators, noting that relatively high capital requirements could cause "potential migration of lending activities" into the shadow banking system -- loosely regulated nonbank lenders where supervisors lack oversight authority. From the way the minutes are written, it is unclear how many people shared in that concern.
Officials also discussed a longer-running problem at the January gathering: Inflation has remained below policymakers' 2 percent annual goal even as the unemployment rate lingers near half-century lows and the economy grows steadily.
"A few participants stressed that the committee should be more explicit about the need to achieve its inflation goal on a sustained basis," the minutes said. Several said that "mild overshooting" might help the Fed to reinforce that its goal is symmetric, meaning that officials want price increases to oscillate around 2 percent rather than hovering below that level.
If prices grow too slowly, it diminishes the central bank's already-limited room to cut interest rates in a recession, since the federal funds rate incorporates price gains. As of December, the central bank's preferred price index accelerated by just 1.6 percent.
While Fed officials are hopeful that inflation will rise toward its 2 percent target in 2020, they have expressed a similar optimism for years, only to repeatedly fall short.
The Fed has been reviewing how it goes about achieving maximum employment and stable inflation, and which tools it has to fight recessions. That discussion continued in January with a look at how to handle future financial stability concerns, which could include excessive risk-taking by investors and risky lending by banks.
If the Fed cuts rates to rock-bottom and keeps them there for an extended period to fight recessions, they noted, it could encourage such irresponsible behavior -- and officials reviewed how that reality should potentially play into future policy setting.
Those at the meeting "generally agreed" that the status-quo approach of relying primarily on supervision and regulation to quell financial risks should continue, according to the minutes.
While "many participants remarked that the committee should not rule out the possibility of adjusting the stance of monetary policy to mitigate financial stability risks," officials noted that it was unclear how changes in rates would actually interact with financial vulnerabilities.
As such, "monetary policy should be guided primarily by the outlook for employment and inflation," the minutes said.
Several suggested that the Fed would need a communication strategy to convey the committee's assessment of financial vulnerabilities and the policy implications of those views.

Texto completo: Oil and gas production may be responsible for a far larger share of the soaring levels of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, in the earth's atmosphere than previously thought, new research has found.
The findings, published in the journal Nature, add urgency to efforts to rein in methane emissions from the fossil fuel industry, which routinely leaks or intentionally releases the gas into air.
"We've identified a gigantic discrepancy that shows the industry needs to, at the very least, improve their monitoring," said Benjamin Hmiel, a researcher at the University of Rochester and the study's lead author. "If these emissions are truly coming from oil, gas extraction, production use, the industry isn't even reporting or seeing that right now."
Atmospheric concentrations of methane have more than doubled from preindustrial times. A New York Times investigation into "super emitter" sites last year revealed vast quantities of methane being released from oil wells and other energy facilities instead of being captured.
The extent to which fossil fuel emissions, as opposed to natural sources, are responsible for the rising methane levels has long been a matter of scientific debate. Methane seeps from the ocean bed, for instance, and also spews from land formations called mud volcanoes.
To shed light on the mystery, researchers at Rochester's Department of Earth and Environmental Studies examined ice cores from Greenland, as well as data from Antarctica stretching back to about 1750, before the industrial revolution.
They found that methane emissions from natural phenomena were far smaller than estimates used to calculate global emissions. That means fossil-fuel emissions from human activity -- namely the production and burning of fossil fuels -- were underestimated by 25 to 40 percent, the researchers said.
The scientists were helped in their analysis by different isotopes found in methane emissions from natural sources, compared to emissions from the production of fossil fuels. Isotopes are versions of an element that have very slight differences, allowing the researchers to differentiate between them.
They used a melting chamber with a set of high-power burners to melt more than 2,000 pounds of ice cores to extract and examine air samples from the past. "It looked like a little rocket ship," said Vasilii Petrenko, a co-author of the Nature study and an associate professor at Rochester. "Think of a rocket engine, but except the flames pointing at the device."
Robert Howarth, an earth system scientist at Cornell University who was not involved with the research, called it "a very important study." He said it was consistent with recent research, like a study he published last year that estimated that North American gas production was responsible for about a third of the global increase in methane emissions over the past decade.
"Emissions from fossil sources are correspondingly larger than many have been estimating," Dr. Howarth said. "I find it very convincing."
Daniel J. Jacob, professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University, also described the findings as significant. Current estimates of methane from geological sources "were widely considered too high by atmospheric modelers such as myself," he wrote in an email.
But he took issue with the suggestion that emissions from fossil fuel production were larger than previously estimated. Fossil fuel emissions are "based on fuel production rates, number of facilities, and direct measurements if available. The natural geological source is irrelevant for these estimates," he said.
The disagreement reflects an overall discrepancy between what are called "bottom-up" measurements of emissions, those from individual oil and gas sites, as opposed to "top-down" calculations like the ones carried out by the Rochester researchers. "Bottom-up" measurements can be unreliable because of a lack of data from individual oil and gas sites. With "top-down" measurements, on the other hand, the exact source of emissions can be hard to pin down.
The findings come as oil and gas companies face increased pressure to rein in greenhouse gas emissions from their operations to address rising concerns about climate change.
Methane, the main component of natural gas, is of particular concern, because it can warm the planet more than 80 times as much as the same amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. On top of fossil fuel production, livestock, landfills and other sources linked to human activity also emit methane.
Last week, the British oil giant BP set an ambitious climate change goal, saying it aimed to eliminate or offset by 2050 all planet-warming emissions from its oil and gas production, as well as emissions caused by the burning of the oil and gas it pumps from the ground. The company provided few details on how it would achieve that feat, however.
Adding to climate concerns, the Trump administration is moving forward with a plan that effectively eliminates requirements that oil companies install technology to detect and fix methane leaks from oil and gas facilities. By the Environmental Protection Agency's own calculations, the rollback would increase methane emissions by 370,000 tons through 2025, enough to power more than a million homes for a year.
Dr. Petrenko, one of the Rochester study's authors, said that the huge undertaking of studying giant ice cores meant the study relied on a small sampling of data. "These measurements are incredibly difficult. So getting more data to help confirm our results would be very valuable," he said. "That means there's quite a bit more research to be done."

Texto completo: The 14-year-old suspect was charged as an adult in the murder of a Barnard College student who was stabbed last December.
Three middle school classmates, one of them armed with a knife, entered Morningside Park in northern Manhattan on the night of Dec. 11 looking for someone to rob.
At about the same time, prosecutors said, Tessa Majors, an 18-year-old in her first year at Barnard College, walked into the park through a different entrance.
The classmates, all teenage males, according to prosecutors, first set their sights on an unidentified man, then a woman, and finally, for reasons that remain unclear, Ms. Majors. They demanded her cellphone. When she resisted, biting one of them on the hand, one of teenagers placed her in a headlock and another stabbed her multiple times, the authorities said.
She was found dying just outside the park.
On Wednesday, two months after the high-profile murder rattled a city now accustomed to historically low violent crime rates, prosecutors announced a third arrest in the case.
Luchiano Lewis, 14, was charged in Criminal Court in Manhattan with second-degree murder and robbery.
Mr. Lewis's 14-year-old friend, Rashaun Weaver, was arrested on the same charges over the weekend.
Both are being tried as adults. Prosecutors explained that under New York State law they have the discretion to try defendants as young as 14 as adults in certain cases of violent crime.
Mr. Weaver is accused of stabbing Ms. Majors, while investigators say Mr. Lewis restrained her to prevent her from fleeing.
A 13-year-old who was arrested in December implicated the two other teenagers in the fatal robbery. The 13-year-old was charged with second-degree felony murder as a juvenile.
On Wednesday, Mr. Weaver, wearing a blue button-up shirt and khakis, and Mr. Lewis, who wore a camouflage jacket and gray jeans, stood next to each other as they listened to the murder and robbery charges being read in court.
Both whispered to the judge that they were 14-year-olds and uttered the words "not guilty" when asked to enter a plea.
Mr. Weaver and Mr. Lewis were ordered held without bail at a juvenile detention facility.
The killing of Ms. Majors, who had come from Virginia to study at Barnard, recalled a more violent era in the city when park muggings and murders were far more common.
Her killing also echoed the notorious 1989 April attack on a jogger in Central Park. Investigators and prosecutors relied then on tough interrogation techniques to obtain confessions from five teenagers accused of the brutal assault and rape of the jogger.
The confessions were later proven to be false.
In the long shadow of that case, the authorities said they made sure to take extra steps to ensure that a guardian or a lawyer was present each time one of the teenagers accused of taking part in Ms. Majors's killing was questioned by investigators.
But lawyers with the Legal Aid Society, which represents the 13-year-old defendant, have argued in court hearings that their client was subjected to aggressive interrogation tactics, including browbeating and screaming. That defendant is not accused of killing Ms. Majors but is accused of being involved in the robbery that led to her death.
The New York Times is not naming the 13-year-old because he is not being charged as an adult. He is expected to face trial for his role in the murder in family court in March.
Over two months, investigators accumulated a trove of evidence, including witness statements, DNA samples and video footage, to build a case against the teenagers, the authorities said.
"Our journey to reach that milestone today was not a sprint, but rather it was a painstaking, deliberate and meticulous search for the truth," the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said during the weekend while announcing Mr. Weaver's arrest.
Neighborhood Defender Service, a legal group representing Mr. Weaver, said in a statement that their client's age should shield him from facing harsh punishment.
"Our client is a 14-year-old child with no criminal record or family court history," the group said. "In our shared history, we have seen too often the impact of hasty condemnations of children. Let us take these past experiences as a warning and allow due process to play out in our young client's case, so that justice can prevail."
Relatives for Mr. Weaver and Mr. Lewis -- as well as Ms. Majors's father, Inman Majors -- declined to speak to reporters as they left the courthouse on Wednesday.
Alexis Padilla, a lawyer representing Mr. Lewis, told the judge he believed the prosecution's case was not as strong as it was being made to seem.
"If the video is so clear, why wasn't he arrested much sooner," Ms. Padilla said, alluding to evidence cited by the prosecution. "This is my client's first brush with the law."
Investigators said they did not anticipate charging anyone else in Ms. Majors's killing.
On Wednesday, Matthew Bogdanos, an assistant district attorney, told Justice Gayle Roberts that the teenagers had initially set their eyes on two other people before they encountered Ms. Majors at around 6:50 p.m. while walking up a set of stairs.
"She became intended victim number three," he added. "They literally crossed paths."
Mr. Weaver was also recorded by investigators implicating himself in the murder, saying he had attacked her because "she was hanging on to her phone," according to court records. Ms. Majors was heard yelling "Help me! I'm being robbed!" Moments later she was stabbed four times, the blade piercing her heart once, court records show.
Detectives found her headphones on the ground and her hair tie 10 feet away. She was taken to a hospital but could not be saved.
Investigators said on Wednesday that they knew the teenagers' whereabouts all along and tracked their movements as they built a case.
More than a week after the 13-year-old's arrest, investigators took the unusual step of releasing images of one of the 14-year-old boys, seeking the public's help in identifying him. In late December, detectives tracked that boy, later identified as Mr. Weaver, at a family member's home in the Bronx.
The authorities believe that the teenager's family was shielding him until a wound on his hand had healed, an official briefed on the case said. The official described the mark as consistent with a bite.
Several hours after being questioned by detectives, Mr. Weaver walked out of a police station without being charged.
Days before Ms. Majors's murder, investigators said Mr. Weaver had committed another mugging at knife point in Morningside Park wearing a distinct outfit: a navy jacket with a horizontal white stripe and a red stripe across the chest, according to court records.
Prosecutors said he was seen wearing the same outfit on the night Ms. Majors was killed.
Mr. Bogdanos said they would prove in court that the teenagers acted with ruthless determination when they attacked Ms. Majors for about five minutes as she pleaded for help.
"This wasn't 10 seconds. This was more than a minute," he said. "That's extraordinary for a robbery and murder to take that long. This was a sustained attack, sustained in both space and time that ultimately resulted in Ms. Majors's death."

Texto completo: Seven teams from each conference would make the postseason and only one-seeds would receive byes under the proposal.
The N.F.L. playoffs could expand to include two extra teams as soon as this coming season under a proposed labor agreement now being reviewed by the owners and players, according to a league official who wasn't authorized to speak publicly.
In the new playoff structure, a seventh team from each conference would qualify for the postseason. Only the top seed from each conference would receive a bye the first weekend of the playoffs; the top two seeds receive byes currently.
On that first weekend, the next six teams in each conference would face each other, as opposed to four teams now. The N.F.L. has played a 16-game schedule since 1978 and has had a 12-team playoff format since 1990.
The new format is just one of many proposals included in the collective bargaining agreement negotiations between the players and owners that would revamp the N.F.L. season. Other proposals include reviewing the structure of training camps; reviewing the number of padded practices during the season; and eliminating one preseason game and adding a 17th regular season game in its place.
Including two more playoff teams could lead to more fan interest later in the season and to postseason bonuses for a greater number of players. Thanks in part to the bye week they receive, the percentage of No. 1 and No. 2 seeds that make it to the Super Bowl is high. Reducing byes would presumably give more lower-seeded clubs better chances of reaching the championship game.
The N.F.L.'s television partners would also benefit from being able to broadcast two extra postseason games, which are among the most-watched TV programs every year.
While many players may savor the increased odds of qualifying for the postseason, some have said they oppose adding a 17th regular season game because doing so would raise the risk of injury. The additional game has turned into a major sticking point in negotiations between the N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association, which began about a year ago.
Though the current 10-year labor agreement does not end until March 2021, the owners are pushing for a new agreement before the current league calendar year ends on March 18. Implementing a deal in the middle of a league year is difficult because newly negotiated terms like minimum salaries would have to be prorated.
The owners also want to secure a labor deal as soon as possible so the league can begin negotiations with television networks, whose own rights deals expire in the next couple of years.
About half of the league's revenue comes from broadcast rights, and the bidding for those rights is expected to be strong. The value of the broadcast rights should increase with new streaming rights and, if the owners have their way, a growing number of regular season and playoff games.
To push the current proposed labor agreement over the finish line, the owners have called a special meeting on Thursday in New York, where they will receive an update on the status of talks with the union. On Friday, union representatives from each of the 32 teams will meet via conference call to continue to hash out their differences.
The union's 11 executive committee members, many of whom were opposed to a 17-game season a few weeks ago, would have to vote to recommend this deal to the 32 team representatives for it to move forward. Those representatives would then have to approve a deal by a two-thirds majority before it could be sent to all N.F.L. players for approval. For a deal to be finalized before the end of the current league year, the 32 team representatives would need to vote on a proposal by next week to have enough time to put the agreement to the full membership for a vote.

Re "When Lawmakers Don't Get Trans Children," by Jack Turban (Op-Ed, Feb. 8):
Lawmakers who try to criminalize gender-affirming care for transgender young people don't just put politics above medicine; they're also threatening the human rights of transgender and intersex children.
Withholding gender-affirming care deprives transgender children of any say in what happens to their bodies and puts them at greater risk of depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide.
Equally insidious, these same bills carve out an exception for doctors to keep performing nonconsensual, medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex infants. We have documented how these irreversible surgeries not only risk assigning the wrong gender, but also have potentially lifelong consequences, including a loss of fertility, lessening of sexual sensation, and chronic pain.
Young people should have a voice in what happens to their bodies. Lawmakers should stop demonizing them for the bathrooms they use, the sports they play and the health care they receive. Instead, focus on helping them thrive.

Texto completo: As first-time puppy parents, my husband and I were so naïve: We hilariously believed that our mini poodle mix, Hamilton, would never set foot in our master bedroom. But that delusion disappeared, and we gained a furry bunkmate. In the three years since, I've picked up some hard-earned lessons about keeping our bed a clean, comfortable place to sleep. The following simple strategies (including tips from other Wirecutter pet owners) and a few durable Wirecutter picks should help anyone who has four-legged bedmates. Jackie Reeve
Monitor your pet's intake ... and output. If your pet eats anything suspicious or hasn't pooped all day, keep it out of your bedroom until you're sure it's safe. We learned this the hard way, after having to replace a lot of carpet.
Dress your bed with durable but inexpensive layers. Start with a layer on your mattress to keep your pet from ruining that expensive investment. The SafeRest Premium Mattress Protector (about $ 25) proved waterproof in our tests and should guard your mattress from pet pee or vomit. I recommend buying two so you have a spare if one is in the wash.
It's not worth investing in expensive bedding if your pet is a shredder or a shedder. We love Target's Threshold Performance 400 Thread Count Sheet Set. These comfortable sateen sheets are cheap enough that you won't resent your pet if you need to replace them.
If you're tired of cleaning pet hair (or worse) from your bedding, add a top layer. "I like to top my comforter with a cheap throw, so if my dog sneaks a chew treat into bed or throws up, it won't leak through the other layers," says Katlyn Wells, a Wirecutter staff writer.
Use a bed-on-a-bed. Harry Sawyers, a senior editor for Wirecutter, has a dog that sleeps on a throw pillow inside a quilted sham at the foot of the humans' bed. "It's like her little sublet," he said. If you want a ready-made pet bed that's machine-washable, try our pick for dogs, the Majestic Pet Products Suede Bagel Dog Bed, or one of our favorite beds for cats, the Best Friends by Sheri OrthoComfort Deep Dish Cuddler. Wash them frequently in hot water to help keep fleas (which tend to love pet beds) away. To encourage your pet to use the bed, give them treats and praise them when they do.

Texto completo: He supervised operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East and oversaw a top-secret link with a high official of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Frank Anderson, an American spymaster who oversaw the Central Intelligence Agency's covert mission to funnel weapons and other support to Afghan insurgents fighting their Soviet occupiers in the 1980s, died on Jan. 27 in Sarasota, Fla. He was 78.
The cause was a stroke, his wife, Donna Eby Anderson, said. Mr. Anderson lived in Sarasota and had been in hospice care.
During his nearly 27 years with the C.I.A., Mr. Anderson became the ranking American clandestine officer in the Arab world. He served as Beirut station chief; was promoted to chief of the Near East and South Asia division of the agency's Directorate of Operations, its covert branch; and directed the agency's technical services division, a role similar to that of James Bond's "Q."
Among his missions was, as head of the C.I.A.'s Afghan task force in the late 1980s, to supply weapons to the mujahedeen, the anti-Communist Muslim fighters who resisted the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
The Soviets invaded in December 1979, setting off a nine-year Cold War proxy struggle that left as many as a million Afghan civilians and tens of thousands of troops and insurgents dead. It ended with the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, the year the Soviet Union collapsed.
The withdrawal left a vacuum and ignited a civil war with the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist political movement, that has raged for decades.
"The one lie that they could continue telling themselves was that all this was somehow worth it, because at least the military structure was intact and they were defending the socialist motherland," Mr. Anderson said of the Soviet Union in an interview with the National Security Archive for CNN in 1997.
"What happened in Afghanistan was that that lie was exposed," Mr. Anderson continued, and "the real strategic issue there was that by inflicting that defeat on the Red Army, we really did hasten the fall of an evil empire."
Mr. Anderson also served three tours as station chief in Middle East countries, where his responsibilities included the oversight of a high-level informant within the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Around 1970, Robert Ames, a C.I.A. agent, had opened a back channel to the informant, Ali Hassan Salameh, who headed the personal security force and counterintelligence unit under Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman. Their covert contact was politically sensitive, to say the least: The P.L.O. was classified as a violent guerrilla group, and Mr. Salameh was a self-proclaimed terrorist.
"Anderson believed the C.I.A., through its careful cultivation of clandestine sources, had created the opportunity for the Oslo Accords," Kai Bird wrote in "The Good Spy: The Life and Death of Robert Ames" (2014), and had "brought the Palestinians in from the cold."
The Oslo agreement called for an interim Palestinian government in Gaza and Jericho in the West Bank and eventual Israeli withdrawal. But the process collapsed after terror attacks against Israel resumed and Israelis continued to establish settlements in the West Bank.
After Mr. Salameh was killed in 1979 by Israeli intelligence, Mr. Anderson wrote to Mr. Salameh's eldest son: "At your age, I lost my father. Today, I lost a friend whom I respected more than other men. From the memory of my past loss, and from the pain of today, I share your pain. I promise to honor your father's memory -- and to stand ready to be your friend."
The condolence note was signed, "A friend."
In 1993, as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Mr. Arafat were signing a peace accord at the White House, Mr. Anderson discreetly staged his own ceremony.
He commandeered a bus at C.I.A. headquarters and took dozens of newly minted officers and analysts to Arlington National Cemetery to pay homage to Mr. Ames, who had been killed in a truck bomb attack on the United States Embassy in Beirut in 1983.
Another Ames, Aldrich (no relation), later led to Mr. Anderson's demotion and departure from the agency.
Aldrich Ames was arrested in 1994 as an agency mole for Moscow. That October, R. James Woolsey, the director of central intelligence, severely reprimanded Mr. Ames's supervisor, Milton Bearden, for serious failures during two stints in that role.
The next day, Mr. Anderson and John MacGaffin, who was second in command of covert operators, bestowed an official award on Mr. Bearden for outstanding work on the Afghan operation in the 1980s, when he was the station chief in neighboring Pakistan.
Mr. Woolsey was furious. Mr. Anderson and Mr. MacGaffin were ordered reassigned, a penalty more severe than any meted out to the officials who supervised Mr. Ames. They retired rather than accept their reassignments.
The award was viewed by some as defiance of Mr. Woolsey, who otherwise, Steve Coll wrote in "Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden" (2005), "liked and admired Anderson and relied on him heavily for analysis about Afghanistan and the Arab world."
Mr. Bearden said in an email that Mr. Anderson never regretted the gesture of support that led to his rebuke. "Frank was one of the more thoughtful officers in the Directorate of Operations," he said, "an extremely fair and honest man" with unfailingly good judgment.
Frank Ray Anderson was born on Feb. 1, 1942, in Chicago. His father, also named Frank, owned a bar and died when his son was 14. His mother, Dorothy (Ray) Anderson, worked for a radio manufacturer.
After serving in the Army domestically and in South Korea from 1959 to 1962, Mr. Anderson earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in Chicago and graduated from the Foreign Service Institute's School of Arab Language and Middle East Area Studies in Beirut.
His first two marriages, to Dorothy Kaehn and Barbara Virginia Krieps, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Donna (Eby) Anderson; two sons from his first marriage, Frank Jr. and Mark; a daughter from his second marriage, Amy Anderson; a son, John, from his marriage to Ms. Eby; 13 grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren.
After leaving the C.I.A., Mr. Anderson was president of the Middle East Policy Council, whose mission is to educate the American public on issues in the region. He was an outspoken critic of the use of torture to extract information.
"As an operations officer and leader, I learned that good guys have bad days, and that fear, anger and ambition degrade, rather than enhance, judgment and decision making," he wrote in The Miami Herald in 2014.
"Worse," he added, "false 'information' that came from men who told their interrogators what they wanted to hear in order to stop the pain inflicted on them contributed to serious policy errors."
"Mistreating detainees, even detainees who clearly deserve mistreatment," he continued, "is ineffective, counterproductive, illegal and morally repugnant."
As an agent, Mr. Anderson was methodical and old-school.
"Frank Anderson was one of the last of a generation of C.I.A. station chiefs who were more influential than the American ambassadors in the nations where they served," Tim Weiner, a former New York Times reporter and the author of "Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA" (2008), said in an email. "He saw himself as much as a diplomat as a spy. He would shake the hands of Arab leaders while picking their pockets with his free hand, but the handshake would seem warm and genuine."
Mr. Anderson also preferred to rely on information from human sources, but usually with a measure of skepticism. Mr. Bird, in an interview, recalled that when he was researching his book, Mr. Anderson gave him this advice:
"Continue to exercise caution with stories that can only be corroborated by dead guys. Fabricated stories are almost never made up out of whole cloth, but are made by stitching together generally known facts with bits of uncheckable fantasy."

Texto completo: First Iowa, then New Hampshire. Now the president is on a Western trip, and basing it in Las Vegas, days before the Nevada caucuses.
LAS VEGAS -- President Trump is not exactly a fan of life on the road.
He agreed to a four-day Western trip this week on the condition that he spend every night at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. And that location had another attraction: It placed him at the current center of the 2020 presidential race -- Nevada, where Democrats will vote Saturday in caucuses that could reshape the campaign.
The trip was meant to showcase the president's aggressive re-election push to drum up funds from high-dollar donors in California, a Democratic state where Mr. Trump is widely unpopular but enjoys some concentrated pockets of support. But the president believes that wherever he goes, he can force the news cycles -- and political fortunes -- to turn in his favor.
And the first opportunity to do that was Wednesday night, at the same time the Democrats debated in Las Vegas.
"Should I go to that debate?" Mr. Trump asked a group of volunteers gathered at his hotel before he left for a high-dollar fund-raiser in Palm Springs, Calif.
The president then set off on a hectic schedule that had him hopscotching around California and touching down in Phoenix for a "Keep America Great" rally before returning to Las Vegas for the night. And he will hold two other rallies before returning to Washington -- on Thursday in Colorado Springs and on Friday in Las Vegas.
Both in private and in public, it was clear that Mr. Trump did not want to cede any political spotlight to Democrats on the debate stage.
"We've seen the polls except some of the fake ones," Mr. Trump said in Phoenix. "If I was treated fairly, we'd be up 20 points higher in the polls. There wouldn't even be a competitive election. Unfortunately, I think it's probably going to be competitive."
Journalists were not invited to the president's campaign breakfast at his hotel, but a New York Times reporter was dining in the restaurant as a guest. There, Mr. Trump took aim at CNN and MSNBC for reporting on the polls, but saved his special contempt for Comcast, which owns NBC Universal. He called the media conglomerate "corrupt" and a "disgrace to this country."
Mr. Trump was reacting to several recently released polls, including one by NBC and The Wall Street Journal, that show him trailing several possible Democratic opponents, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
"Internal REAL polls show I am beating all of the Dem candidates," Mr. Trump tweeted shortly before leaving for Rancho Mirage, Calif., near Palm Springs, for a private fund-raiser. "The Fake News Polls (here we go again, just like 2016) show losing or tied."
One Democrat in particular has held the president's attention: Michael R. Bloomberg. For weeks, Mr. Trump has been preoccupied with Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor and late entry to the Democratic presidential race.
"Is corrupt Bloomberg News going to say what a pathetic debater Mini Mike is," Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning, using a nickname to insult Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has recently enjoyed a surge of popularity but who was untested on the debate stage.
At his rally, the president again assailed polling in the news media and expressed criticism that Mr. Bloomberg had bought his way into the Democratic race, appearing to fixate on the amount of money the former mayor had spent on his campaign.
"My father would teach me: If you could spend less and win, that's better than spending a lot and winning," he told the crowd.
Mr. Trump's setting up base in Nevada this week was not the first time he suddenly appeared in the middle of the Democratic Party's nominating process. Last month, he held a rally in Des Moines, four days before the Iowa caucuses.
Eleven days later, the president traveled to Manchester, N.H., the evening before the state held its primary election on Feb. 11, though in that case he was on the Republican ballot.
"If you want clear proof of how terrified Donald Trump is, just look at his travel schedule," Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on Wednesday. "He keeps following Democrats from state to state because he knows our message is resonating. Nevada is no exception. Nevadans have rejected this president and his policies, and they're ready to elect a Democrat to the White House."
In Nevada, it seemed that voters were attuned to Mr. Trump's attempts to wrest attention back to his own campaign.
"It's really disruptive, and in a way it goes hand in hand with his presidency," Hillary Steinberg, 56, said at a restaurant in the Las Vegas Arts District. "His entire presidency has been a disruption, so it makes sense that he would do a rally so close to the primary."
Rick Van Diepen, an owner of a sustainable architecture consultancy in Las Vegas, said that it was a "pretty typical distraction," but an effective one.
"It's a good tactic to keep his base energized, especially in a state that doesn't have a Republican primary," said Mr. Van Diepen, 49. "It's reminding them that he's here, too."
But at his rally, Mr. Trump tried to pre-emptively cast doubt on the Nevada electoral process, using the caucus chaos in Iowa as an example. (Technical glitches, among other problems, caused a major delay in reporting the results from the state's first-in-the-national presidential contest.)
"In Nevada I'm hearing bad things about the vote count -- they don't know what the hell they're doing," the president said before quickly adding he hoped that was not the case.
Aside from the attention-grabbing spectacle of long lines, ample media coverage and cars festooned with Trump-Pence signs driving by candidates' events, Mr. Trump's travels through four states on his Western swing have created a logistical nightmare for some Democratic candidates.
At least one campaign complained that Mr. Trump's trip to Las Vegas hampered its Thursday plans, with the flight restrictions that accompany an Air Force One arrival and departure complicating its attempts for travel to more than one other state from now until Saturday.
But Justin Buoen, Senator Amy Klobuchar's campaign manager, saw only an upside to the president's presence.
"I haven't gotten any sense that people care about him being here except for that it fires our base up," he said. "I don't think it's hurt coverage of the candidates on cable news networks or even local TV. It hasn't been any kind of distraction."
Though she rarely even makes mention of the president's current travels, Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, does have a favorite laugh line in her stump speech regarding Mr. Trump's last-minute rallies before the Louisiana and Kentucky governors' elections last year.
"The night before the election in both those states, who went down there to campaign for those Democratic governors as opponents? Donald Trump," Ms. Klobuchar has said. "So my first question is, where can we send him next? Because that went pretty well."
The Democratic candidates won in both cases.
Reporting was contributed by Jim Rutenberg, Reid J. Epstein, Maggie Haberman, Nick Corasaniti and Isabella Grullón Paz.

Michigan to Investigate Former Doctor

Texto completo: The announcement by Michigan came months after a former student told the university that Dr. Robert E. Anderson had engaged in sexual misconduct.
The University of Michigan said Wednesday that it was investigating whether one of its doctors had assaulted patients across several decades, becoming at least the third Big Ten university to reckon with allegations of sexual misconduct by longtime members of its medical staff.
In a statement, Michigan said that "several individuals" had described sexual misconduct by Dr. Robert E. Anderson, who worked for the university for more than 30 years and died in 2008. Although Michigan did not detail the allegations, which it said included episodes as far back as the 1970s, the university's president, Mark Schlissel, said that the accusations were "disturbing and very serious."
Michigan said its campus police department had opened an inquiry last summer, after Warde Manuel, the athletic director, received a message from a former student who said that Anderson had engaged in abuse during medical exams in the '70s. During the investigation, Michigan said, other people described "sexual misconduct and unnecessary medical exams," including at least one allegation that wrongdoing had occurred in the '90s.
Local prosecutors decided recently that they would not bring any charges in connection to the allegations against Anderson, in part because of the state's statute of limitations, which is generally six years.
Steven Hiller, the chief assistant prosecuting attorney for Washtenaw County, Mich., said in an interview on Wednesday that "nothing in the report" from university authorities showed evidence of any crimes that could prompt charges against anyone who is still alive.
But the university, which issued its statement after The Detroit News approached Michigan for comment about allegations involving Anderson, said it was still asking others who may have been abused to speak with investigators from a law firm in Washington.
"As part of our commitment to understanding what happened and inform any changes we might need to make, we now are taking the next step to reach out to determine who else might be affected or have additional information to share," Schlissel said. "Every person in our community should expect to feel safe and supported."
Anderson was a fixture of the university's campus in Ann Arbor. He earned his medical degree from Michigan in 1953, according to an obituary published in an alumni magazine that described him as "a pioneer in the field of sports medicine." He worked under four football coaches -- Bump Elliott, Bo Schembechler, Gary Moeller and Lloyd Carr -- and was the director of the university's student health service. He retired in 2003.
Until Wednesday, Michigan's inquiry had been unfolding behind closed doors while Michigan State and Ohio State publicly grappled with abuses committed by team doctors.
Ohio State said last year that Dr. Richard H. Strauss, whose roles in Columbus included serving as a doctor for the athletic department, had abused at least 177 men in the 1970s, '80s and '90s. Critics of the university, including some involved in litigation against the school, assert that Strauss, who died by suicide in 2005, abused scores more people.
In August, a review panel said that medical regulators had unearthed evidence of abuse during Strauss's life but that "systemic failures" at the university and the state's medical board had for years "prevented any tangible administrative or criminal consequences."
And at Michigan State, there has been sustained fallout from the case of Lawrence G. Nassar, the former team doctor for the school and for U.S.A. Gymnastics who sexually abused many girls and young women.
Nassar, who pleaded guilty to an array of charges, was effectively sentenced to life in prison, but prosecutors have also pursued others in connection with the investigation into his abuses.
Kathie Klages, a former gymnastics coach at Michigan State, was found guilty last week of lying to investigators when she told them she did not remember whether two teenagers had told her that they had been sexually abused by Nassar.
Lou Anna Simon, who was Michigan State's president until 2018, has also been charged with lying to investigators. She is awaiting trial.
There have also been hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements and settlement offers, including one last month from U.S.A. Gymnastics, which said it was willing to pay $ 215 million to hundreds of plaintiffs, including Olympic gymnasts, who said that Nassar had abused them.
That settlement offer, which a lawyer for many plaintiffs condemned as "unconscionable," followed an agreement under which Michigan State promised to pay $ 500 million.

Texto completo: The New York Times received four George Polk Awards on Wednesday, the most of any news organization, including one for The 1619 Project, a series from The Times Magazine centered on reframing United States history by focusing on the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans.
Long Island University, the institutional home of the Polk Awards, announced the 15 winners of one of journalism's most prestigious honors at the National Press Club in Washington.
The award for political reporting was split between reporters at The Wichita Eagle, a Kansas newspaper owned by McClatchy, which declared bankruptcy this month, and The Baltimore Sun, a daily owned by Tribune Publishing, which recently disclosed that its largest shareholder is Alden Global Capital, a hedge fund with a reputation for cutting costs at newsrooms it owns.
Reporting for The Eagle, Chance Swaim, Jonathan Shorman and Dion Lefler revealed that the Wichita mayor, Jeff Longwell, had steered a $ 524 million contract to friends and supporters, instead of the choice of a selection panel.
The Sun reporter Luke Broadwater worked with colleagues to show that Mayor Catherine Pugh of Baltimore had collected $ 800,000 disguised as bulk purchases by hospitals and health insurers of her self-published "Healthy Holly" children's books. The Sun's journalism led to the resignation of Ms. Pugh, who pleaded guilty to federal charges.
Nikole Hannah-Jones of The Times and other contributors to The 1619 Project won a special award. In a news release, the Polk Awards cited Ms. Hannah-Jones's "powerful introduction," noting that it "examined efforts of black Americans to advance the nation's expressed ideals of democracy, liberty and equality in the face of centuries of oppression and exclusion."
The project, which Ms. Hannah-Jones created, has been adapted into an audio series and was featured in a recent television commercial for The Times starring the singer Janelle Monáe.
Five historians disputed what they characterized as the project's argument that "the United States was founded on racial slavery" in a letter to the editor and sought corrections; Jake Silverstein, the editor in chief of The Times Magazine, defended the project and declined to include the requested corrections.
Other Times journalists who were named as Polk honorees included Azam Ahmed, the winner in the category of foreign reporting for his work on gang warfare across Latin America and the Caribbean, and Brian M. Rosenthal, who won the local reporting award for his investigation of the underground economy behind New York City taxi medallions. Mark Scheffler, Malachy Browne and others at the Times's visual investigations desk won the international award for their open-source reporting on the bombing of hospitals, a refugee camp and a busy street in Syria by Russian pilots.
The Washington Post's Craig Whitlock won the military reporting award for "The Afghanistan Papers," which showed that U.S. officials' real-time acknowledgments of failures in the war in Afghanistan had been kept from the public. The Houston Chronicle's Lomi Kriel won in the national reporting category for uncovering the Trump administration's border policies.
Three reporters from Bloomberg News won the financial reporting award for a series on how some investors exploited and profited from the "opportunity zone" codicil of the 2017 federal tax law, which was designed to benefit impoverished neighborhoods.
Four reporters from The Seattle Times won in the business reporting category for showing that the Federal Aviation Administration had approved the Boeing 737 Max's flight control system -- later found to be flawed, after two fatal crashes -- after its cooperation with Boeing's own inspectors. One of the reporters, Mike Baker, is now the Seattle bureau chief for The New York Times.
Lizzie Presser won the magazine reporting award for an article published by the nonprofit ProPublica and The New Yorker about legal maneuverings that took land away from black families in the South who had owned it for generations. John Sudworth won for television reporting because of his BBC News investigation into China's camps for members of the Uighur ethnic minority.
The staff of the Long Island tabloid Newsday won in the metropolitan reporting category for a multimedia investigative series, "Long Island Divided," that uncovered racial discrimination by more than 90 suburban real estate agents in violation of state and federal law. The project took three years to report.
Several of the winners are expected to participate in a seminar moderated by the journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault at the Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, part of Long Island University Brooklyn, on April 2. A luncheon ceremony in Manhattan is scheduled for the next day.
The awards are given each year in memory of the CBS correspondent George Polk, who was murdered in 1948 while covering the Greek civil war.
"In an age when much of our most incisive journalism is the product of multi-organization collaboration and team reporting, it is heartening to note that eight of this year's Polk winners are the work of individual reporters," John Darnton, the curator of the awards, said in a statement. "This speaks to the legacy of the man whose work these awards continue to honor 72 years after his assassination."

Milken's pardon follows campaign to rehab image Junk bond king known as poster boy of 1980s greed

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump pardoned Michael Milken on Tuesday, it came just a week after the former junk bond king's Milken Institute had wrapped up its latest conference in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
The gathering featured a mix of high-powered leaders, including hedge-fund guru Ray Dalio and former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, but it wasn't just about how to make money or navigate the Washington, D.C., thicket. Reflecting the Santa Monica, Calif., institute's focus, the program of the 2020 Middle East and Africa Summit featured sessions on health, global diseases, education and the environment.
The event was only the latest manifestation of the 73-year-old's decadeslong commitment to philanthropy. It began before he pleaded guilty to felony violations of securities laws in 1990, but was ramped up in the years since in what became either an intentional or unintentional effort, depending on your view, to rehabilitate his image as the poster boy of 1980s greed.
In a tearful admission of guilt in a New York City federal courtroom, Milken pleaded in April 1990 to counts of conspiracy; aiding and abetting failure to meet federal securities disclosure regulations; securities fraud; aiding and abetting a regulated broker-dealer to violate securities reporting requirements; mail fraud; and assisting in filing a false tax return.
Milken was given a 10-year sentence, fined $200 million and required to pay $400 million in restitution. He later settled lawsuits for an additional $500 million. He served 22 months at a minimum-security prison dubbed "Club Fed" in Dublin, Calif., and was released after testifying against a former colleague. He also was banned for life from the securities industry.
Milken was among 11 felons who were either granted pardons or commutations of their sentences by Trump on Tuesday. Among the others was former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was serving a 14-year sentence for trying to sell an open U.S. Senate seat held by Barack Obama.
The president's decision follows a long campaign by Milken's supporters to win a pardon for him. In 2018, financier Anthony Scaramucci, who served briefly as Trump's communications director, told the Los Angeles Times that Los Angeles financier Gary Winnick, a former associate of Milken at now-defunct investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, had raised the issue at Trump's inauguration, citing his "commitment to health and global progress."
Other proponents of a Milken pardon at the time were said to include Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; and Rudy Giuliani, Trump's outside counsel.
It was Giuliani's investigation of Wall Street malfeasance in the 1980s, when he was a federal prosecutor, that led to Milken's guilty plea and imprisonment.
Through his pioneering use of junk bonds, Milken was credited with rescuing companies running low on cash or never had much to start with.
But critics accused him of enabling corporate raiders to plunder and gut viable corporations, laying off workers by the thousands.
The New York Times called Milken "the most powerful, most innovative, and most feared American financier since J.P. Morgan." He wasn't known for lavish living, but his $550 million salary and bonus in 1987 alone prompted outcries in newspaper editorials.

Video games get them off sofa Companies aim to make players more active, fold fitness into fun products

Texto completo: Tiffany Ruiz had tried various gyms, apps, workout routines and diets, all in an effort to get fit and lose some weight. "None of them worked because none of them kept my interest," she said.
Now, Ruiz is working out at least four times a week, thanks to a video game.
In her bedroom, she sprints, squats, stretches and performs other exercises like knee lifts and shoulder presses, all while battling a muscle-bound dragon and its toadies in "Ring Fit Adventure," a new game from Nintendo, the Japanese consumer tech giant.
"I am so focused on beating the high score or conquering an enemy that before I know it, 30 minutes have passed," said Ruiz, 26, who is studying to become a nursing assistant in Bakersfield, California.
"Ring Fit Adventure," created for the Nintendo Switch console, is the latest effort by the video game industry to try to entice consumers to get up off the couch and become more active.
Developers are folding fitness into games as part of a dual-pronged strategy: to retain players by offering a physical twist on traditional gameplay and to draw in new ones like Ruiz who are looking to break up the monotony of working out.
"Developers are trying to reach people who want fun and fitness at the same time," said Rik Eberhardt, a program manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Game Lab. "They know fitness is good for them, but it can feel like a chore in their busy lives."
Fitness games make up just 1% of the market, but the overall industry is steadily growing. Sales of games across all platforms generated $35.4 billion in the United States last year, up 2% from 2018, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.
"Exergaming," a portmanteau of exercise and gaming, has been around since the late 1980s, when Bandai introduced Power Pad, a gray mat with pressure sensors, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Games now use motion sensors, smartwatches and even virtual reality to track a player's movement.
Some games disguise fitness routines in the form of role-playing, dancing or other activities like running from zombies. Others are fitness and health apps that lead users through workouts with scoreboards, real-time feedback and multiplayer options. Nintendo's Wii game console brought exergaming into the mainstream in 2006. Its "Wii Fit" game incorporated a balance board so players burned calories through calisthenics and yoga.
"The Wii had the fastest adoption rate in the U.S. of any console in the first three years," Mat Piscatella, an industry analyst for NPD, said. "Wii Fit" remains one of the bestselling games in the United States, according to NPD.
Nintendo's two main competitors, Microsoft and Sony, followed its lead, adding motion-detecting cameras to their consoles. Games like "Just Dance" and "Zumba Fitness: Join the Party," which were available on Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony consoles, were "breakout successes" in the motion era, Piscatella said.
Since then, the industry has been overturned by the rise of mobile devices, which allow games to be played on the go.
Exergames are not without risks, said Eefje Battel, a project manager at the Sports Innovation Campus at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Bruges, Belgium. One element missing in "Ring Fit," she said, is a coach to ensure that players are performing exercises correctly and safely.

Texto completo: Welcome to the 21st century nuclear arms race. Once again, we're teetering on the brink of nuclear conflict instead of taking critical steps toward de-escalation and disarmament.
If it feels like we're in the middle of a wacky James Bond movie plot, that's not far off. Any progress we were making toward nuclear safety is being rapidly, systematically and recklessly dismantled by the Trump administration.
Current tensions with Iran, particularly after the assassination of top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, have heightened not just the risk of regional conflict but also of global nuclear war.
In his State of the Union address on Feb. 4, President Donald Trump declared that Iran "must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons," without acknowledging that he unilaterally withdrew the United States from an international treaty, which was successfully doing just that. It's vital that the United States get back to the negotiating table and reenter the Iran deal.
Trump also pulled out of the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the United States and Russia. This treaty led to the elimination of nearly 2,700 intermediate-range missiles and helped the two countries make tangible progress in stabilization and disarmament efforts.
Currently, the most important arms control treaty the United States is still a party to is the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as New START. The treaty is set to expire just a year from now, in February 2021.
In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to immediately extend the New START treaty, without preconditions. But New START's future remains unclear. Trump has hinted in the past that he may let the treaty simply expire, while senior U.S. officials have said that Washington wants a broader deal involving China.
Former United States Secretary of State Dr. Madeleine Albright and former Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov co-authored a Feb. 10 op-ed in the New York Times urging the United States to work to extend New START.
"Doing nothing while waiting for a 'better' agreement is a recipe for disaster: We could lose New START and fail to replace it," they wrote. "The treaty's agreed limits on nuclear arsenals are too important to be put at risk in a game of nuclear chicken."
The stakes in preserving or reentering these vital arms control treaties could not be higher.
Besides ditching vital arms control treaties, the Trump administration is actively revving up the arms race. On Feb. 5, the U.S. Defense Department confirmed that the Navy has deployed a low-yield, submarine-launched ballistic missile warhead.
To call these weapons "low-yield" is misleading. At 6.5 kilotons, they are 2,600 times more powerful than the 1995 Oklahoma City bomb. And they may be indistinguishable on radar from missiles armed with high-yield bombs, meaning an adversary could respond to a launch with a full attack, immediately escalating the conflict to a full nuclear war.
Proponents of this low-yield nuclear warhead say it is more "usable," a turn of phrase that should concern everyone. A more "usable" warhead increases the risk of actual nuclear conflict, while decreasing U.S. national security.
We all have a vital interest in ensuring that nuclear weapons are not used. It's time for the United States to take the lead on nonproliferation and disarmament. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' Doomsday Clock, which rates the danger of unparalleled catastrophe, is now set at 100 seconds to midnight, closer than ever to an apocalyptic disaster. And in the real world, we can't rely on a vodka martini-sipping British spy to save us.

Resumen: It’s well past time to bury the 'Bernie is unelectable' trope. He has a better shot than moderate Bloomberg.

Texto completo: There has been a mass freakout among the Democratic establishment as Bernie Sanders continues to surge in the polls. In two surveys released Tuesday, the Vermont senator has opened up a double-digit lead over his closest competitors in the Democratic primary.
The desperation has caused many Democrats to set their sights on former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg as the man who will save us all from Donald Trump. But first he’ll have to save us from Bernie Sanders. The billionaire businessman has paid a pretty penny for every point he has risen in the national polls to overtake the prior moderate savior, Joe Biden.
For most of the primary season, politicos, commentators and journalists have dismissed the Sanders candidacy at best or attacked and misrepresented it at worst with the New York Times editorial board myopically comparing Sanders to Trump and calling his policy prescriptions “overly rigid, untested and divisive. ” How often do we hear it claimed with soothsayer certainty, “A democratic socialist will never be elected president in the United States?”
You know who else will “never” be elected president of the United States? A former reality TV star with zero governing or policy experience who attacks war heroes, the parents of war heroes, brags on tape about grabbing women by the p___y, and…well, you get my point.
This is not to say that because Donald Trump became president — after improbably winning a Republican primary after praising single payer health care, attacking the Bush family, the Iraq War and challenging other previously sacred cows on the right — that anyone can become president. It’s to point out how the ground has shifted in terms of what is possible in politics. The old rules simply do not apply, so we should stop using them.
It’s true that at one point calling yourself a “democratic socialist” would be a bridge too far for many voters, including Democrats. But that was before people began to realize how unmoored the American capitalist system is from any sense of ethics or morality. The level of economic inequality and suffering from lack of affordable health care, crushing debt, and a discriminatory and racist for-profit incarceration system in one of the world’s wealthiest countries is astonishing. People are exhausted from working non-stop trying to just survive financially in a system that dangles the carrot of financial stability or wealth always slightly out of reach except for a favored few. Nothing about this is normal and that is fundamentally Bernie Sanders’ so-called “radical” argument.
Bloomberg's 'moderate lane'
As Bernie’s new foil, Bloomberg is waving the “moderate lane” banner of electability and claiming that Bernie’s kooky notions (which are just considered normal behavior in many industrialized countries) go too far for American voters. These are the same voters who would cut off your hand if you reached for their socialist Medicare or Social Security. Still, the premise of Bloomberg as electable slipped seamlessly into the public debate. Of course, Bernie fares just as well, and sometimes better, than Bloomberg in hypothetical matchups against Trump but the electable moniker has mysteriously eluded him.
Dear news media: Don't turn the 2020 Democratic debates into Trump-like Twitter fodder
It's time to get real: Michael Bloomberg is not the candidate who can beat Donald Trump
What ultimately will make the Democratic standard bearer electable is his or her ability to excite and turn out voters. This is why the most pertinent issue for Bernie’s electability argument has been his weak history attracting African American support. While he made significant inroads since 2016, much of that critical voting bloc has been locked up with Joe Biden. But that is shifting. Tuesday’s NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist found that Bernie has narrowed that gap to just three points, and he tops Bloomberg by 12 points.
Either way, it’s hard to believe that the mayor who expanded “stop and frisk” in New York City and defended it all the way up to a month before he announced his candidacy is going to excite black voters, particularly young black voters who have made their preference for Bernie manifest. For that matter, why would any Democratic voter, regardless of their race, be excited about a candidate who lacked the imagination to grasp that being treated like a criminal just for existing would be a traumatizing experience for black and brown people?
Moreover, Bloomberg’s performance in his first Democratic primary debate Wednesday night was imperious and underwhelming. He absurdly claimed that the non-disclosure agreements women at his company signed were “consensual” and refused to agree to let them speak openly about their experiences working for his company. He stumbled through an explanation of stop-and-frisk claiming, “it got out of control,” when he was the one who had total control over it. Responding to Bernie’s contention that billionaires should not exist, Bloomberg claimed he is giving all his money away. But trying to buy your way into the presidency is not charity. He came out of the gate attacking Sanders, claiming he had no chance to beat Trump, because he’ll scare moderate voters.
Biden voters back Bernie
But a Buzzfeed reporter surveyed moderate Democratic voters at a Biden Iowa event last month and one after another said despite their concerns about Sanders, they’d pull the lever for him if he won the nomination.
There’s no doubt that if Bernie is the nominee Republicans will continue to conflate democratic socialism with communism and pretend that Venezuela is Sanders’ ideal society even though Bernie has said he is a democratic Socialist in the vein of the Scandinavian countries, home to the world’s happiest people. Republicans will lie about what Bernie believes the same way they will lie about whoever becomes the Democratic nominee.
Democrats should have learned by now to not let Republicans pick their candidates for them. Remember when conventional wisdom in 2016 said Nancy Pelosi should be replaced because Republicans used her as a proxy to attack all Democrats as too liberal and out of touch? “After Democrats’ Losses Nancy Pelosi Becomes a Symbol of What Went Wrong,” a New York Times headline blared following the 2016 election. Pelosi managed to cling to her power and Republicans made the San Francisco pol the star of many of their 2018 campaign ads against Democrats in swing districts. Yet, the Democrats took back the House with the largest midterms margin in history. Then Pelosi emerged as one of the only Democratic leaders able to effectively stand up against Trump.
Ultimately, there’s no reason to believe that voters are being motivated in any meaningful way by ideology this cycle. People who are more afraid of a single payer health care system and free college than they are of Donald Trump and his creeping authoritarianism are probably not Democratic voters or even Democratic leaning independents.
Bernie's socialism isn't communism
Bloomberg derided Bernie’s views as “communism” in last night’s debate, echoing Republican talking points. On the campaign trail last year, Sanders explained his vision of how democratic socialism would work: it’s “an economy in which you have wealth being created by the private sector, but you have a fair distribution of that wealth, and you make sure the most vulnerable people in this country are doing well. ”
Whatever people’s fears about Bernie’s democratic socialism, the fact remains he’s running for president, not king, of the United States. Some of his solutions are dead on and others less so. But he cannot enact any of them without the support of Congress. This means he will have to use his bully pulpit to bring the country around to his point of view if he wants to enact change. American voters are capable of grasping this this.
It’s well past time to bury the “Bernie is unelectable” trope.

Texto completo: Victoria's Secret could soon become a private company.
L Brands, the struggling retailer's parent company, is expected to sell the lingerie brand to a private-equity company as early as Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday. The paper, citing unnamed sources, said the deal valued Victoria's Secret at $1. 1 billion.
Sycamore Partners, a New York-based investment company that has taken other retailers private including office-supply giant Staples, is expected to buy 55% of Victoria's Secret, the Journal reported.
According to the report, L Brands could retain 45% of the private company, which would include Victoria's Secret's Pink chain. Bath & Body Works is expected to remain a publicly-traded company.
Billionaire Leslie Wexner, who has run L Brands for more than 50 years, is expected to step down as CEO and chairman, the Journal reported.
Pier 1 store closings: These locations are slated to shutter. Is yours on the list?
Macy's store closings map: Macy's is closing 125 stores with the first locations closing soon: Is your location on the map?
Victoria's Secret has had some recent struggles.
Last November, the annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was canceled after the company had announced in May it was going to "re-think" the show.
Then in early February, the New York Times detailed accusations of "misogyny, bullying and harassment" within the company. Days later, more than 100 models signed a letter to Victoria's Secret CEO John Mehas demanding that the lingerie company increase efforts to "protect the people they profit from. "
Wexner has come under fire for his connection to financier Jeffrey Epstein who served as his personal advisor. Wexner alleged in August that Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family. "
In February 2019, L Brands announced 53 Victoria's Secret stores would close. According to a November report to investors, 55 stores closed between November 2018 and November 2019 leaving the brand with 923 U. S. stores. The November report shows 143 Pink stores, three more than in 2018.
Bath & Body Works, which has seen steady growth in locations and sales, had 1,641 U. S. stores as of November, 19 more than the year prior.

Grenell named to top intelligence post

Texto completo: Ambassador to Germany, a loyal Trump confidant, takes post on acting basis
President Trump on Wednesday named Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, as the next acting director of national intelligence, placing a fiercely loyal ally atop an intelligence structure he has frequently railed against.
It is unclear whether Trump intends to nominate Grenell to fill the top intelligence post on a permanent basis, which would require Senate confirmation.
The appointment took many in Washington, including on Capitol Hill, by surprise.
Grenell, a former State Department official and communications executive, has been a Trump confidant and ad hoc adviser on issues beyond his ambassadorial work in Berlin.
He is a conservative foreign policy hawk and sometime media critic, as well as a vocal supporter of Trump on social media. He has sparked controversy in his diplomatic role, but also won praise in Germany and elsewhere for taking on issues such as gay rights in Eastern Europe and the long-running tensions between Kosovo and Serbia.
Grenell would be the first openly gay member of the Trump Cabinet. He did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump was being pushed by some in the intelligence community to nominate the current acting intelligence director, Joseph Maguire, to take the job permanently, but the president has been fixated on appointing people he believes are loyal to him, according to White House officials who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
In recent weeks, he has asked aides which employees are 'bad' or 'leakers' and deserve to be fired, aides said.
In a statement, Maguire said 'it has been an honor to work alongside the men and women of the intelligence community' as acting director of national intelligence, and that he was 'committed to leading [them] until Ambassador Grenell assumes the role.'
Maguire, who was scheduled to meet with White House officials Thursday afternoon, was blindsided by the news, said a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation.

The New York Times first reported Grenell's expected appointment.
Grenell's loyalty to the president extends beyond his public statements. In 2018, internal documents from the Trump International Hotel in Washington listed Grenell as a 'Gold' level member of the Trump Organization's 'Trump Card' loyalty program.
This is the second time that Trump has given a prominent post to a high-level Trump Card member. Kelly Craft, Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, also had gold status, according to the 2018 documents " 'VIP Arrivals' lists that the hotel used to alert employees to important guests. The lists were obtained by The Washington Post.
Grenell's appointment is likely to exacerbate tensions between the president and members of the intelligence community, who have been frequent targets of Trump's ire.
Current and former officials questioned Grenell's qualifications to lead the intelligence agencies and said his loyalty to Trump appeared to be the reason for his appointment.
'Nothing in Grenell's background suggests that he has the skill set or the experience to be an effective leader of the intelligence community,' said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, who was the director of the National Counterterrorism Center under Trump and President Barack Obama and who has known and worked with Maguire for over a decade.
'His chief attribute seems to be that President Trump views him as unfailingly loyal " hardly sufficient to make someone qualified to perform the duties of the DNI.'
Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA official, questioned why the White House had again chosen not to nominate a permanent intelligence director.
'How are both sides of the aisle not outraged by yet another 'acting' role?' he said. 'We are in need of the DNI designate to provide his thoughts on the whistleblower statute, the intelligence community plan to thwart potential Russian interference in the 2020 elections, possible Iranian retaliation for the Qasem Soleimani strike and other key national security challenges.'
Grenell inspired controversy almost from the moment he became ambassador in 2018. In a tweet he posted hours after Trump said the United States would exit the Iran nuclear deal, Grenell wrote that 'German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.'
Germany and other key U.S. allies said they intended to remain in the agreement and the perceived ultimatum angered some officials in Berlin. Grenell has also focused on NATO and the shortfall in German defense spending, an issue Trump mentions frequently.
Grenell also drew criticism from diplomats and foreign officials for an interview with the right-wing Breitbart news site, in which he said he wanted to 'empower' conservatives in Europe.
One U.S. official familiar with the decision said Grenell is expected to take up his new post quickly.

Texto completo: A fact, from a recent New York Times piece headlined: “How Trump Is Running to Snatch Victory From the Jaws of Defeat, Again” caught my eye.
That fact: “turnout in the close swing states that draw the vast bulk of campaigning is about 16 percent higher than elsewhere.”
There are two obvious explanatory reasons for this.
Fact 1: The campaigns devote dramatically disproportionate shares of their effort to turning out every possible vote in their favor in the swing states that will decide the outcome of the election.
Fact 2: Even without that effort by the campaigns, voters know whether they live in a swing state. Those who need a little extra motivation to vote would naturally be more inclined to turn out if they think their vote might make a difference than if they know in advance which ticket is going to carry the state.
As regular readers of this space know, I am not the biggest admirer of the U.S. system of politics and government, nor of the oft-claimed perfection of the U.S. Constitution. I’ve railed against the Electoral College system often. Here’s an overview in an old piece of mine, titled “10 reasons why the Electoral College is a problem” from a MinnPost series published way back in 2012.
But, to tell you the truth, although I have often noted that, by the standards of developed democracies around the world, U.S. turnout rates totally suck, I had never focused on the degree of the E-College’s impact on turnout between swing states and flyover states.
Reading the Times piece, it immediately made sense. Just as it also made sense that, if Donald Trump can make a glitch in our system work to his advantage, it’s not hard to imagine him getting re-elected in 2020 while losing the popular vote by an even larger margin than he did in 2016. In his own adorable way, he often brags about this way of winning while losing, as if it makes him especially clever, while not acknowledging that it’s at least a tad awkward to claim a mandate when you have won neither a majority nor a plurality of the votes.
Because I am also a history nerd and have paid a lot of attention to the framers of the Constitution, I’ll just offer a couple of more paragraphs to make the argument that the distortions above have nothing to do with anything the framers “intended” when they invented the Electoral College.
The E-College was a late-breaking idea at the Constitutional Convention, designed to solve several problems you wouldn’t normally think about. The framers wanted a reasonably strong executive (although nowhere near as strong as what the presidency has turned into). But they were stumped on how such a person would be chosen.
A straight-up election was unimaginable to them, based on the existing society. There were no national parties to nominate candidates, no national media to inform the national electorate, no tradition of (or desire for) candidates to race around the country promising things and begging for votes.
For the first hundred years of the republic, presidential candidates were expected to stay home, say nothing specific about what they would do if elected, and modestly and demurely do nothing by way of gauche self-promotion. Seriously.
(Nothing that we would call actual campaigning was done until the 1890s. William Jennings Bryan was the breakthrough figure in that regard in 1896, but he lost to William McKinley, who followed the older tradition of staying home and addressing small delegations who came to his home and he would receive them in the tradition known as the “front porch” campaign, but say nothing much of substance.)
It’s also likely that the framers did not mean the Electoral College to actually choose the president. If you read the unamended Constitution that was written and ratified in the late 1780s, some surprising things jump out at you.
The framers didn’t mandate, nor really expect, that states would hold popular elections in connection with the presidential selection process. (In the absence of national parties or a national media, it’s a little hard to see how that would even work.)
So the process required each state legislature to choose a few trusted state leaders to serve as “electors.” These would be the kind of respected members of the elite (white men, one might add), who would be more likely to know about some of the outstanding potential presidents from around the country.
The framers assumed that most of those electors would vote for men they knew, likely from their own states. So the original Constitution required that each elector, voting at a meeting in the state capital, to write down the name of two men they thought would be good presidents with the important requirement that one of them not be from their own state . Without such a requirement, in that highly localized society, most electors would vote only for men they knew from their own state, and leaders of the big states would always get the most electoral votes, but it was unlikely that, with the likely exception of George Washington, no one would ever get a majority of even the electoral vote.
But the framers probably didn’t believe that, after Washington, the winner of that “electoral” vote would become president. The Constitution required (and still requires) that the president be named on an absolute majority of the electoral ballots.
Everyone understood that George Washington would win the first election. (And, in fact, he was named on every ballot, although each elector had to vote for two men for president (not one for president and one for vice president. That was later changed by amendment).
And it seemed likely that, after Washington, no one might be named on a majority of the ballots. Remember: No two-party system yet. No national party nominating conventions. No national media.
So the Constitution said, and still does, that if no one was named on a majority of the Electoral College ballots (as seemed likely to them would occur, after Washington) the names of the top five finishers would be forwarded to the U.S. House, which would choose the president on (this is pretty amazing) a one-state one-vote basis. (The rule of five would be amended to the top three.)
OK, although I find this history endlessly interesting, I fear I may have worn out my welcome for one day among those less obsessed with constitutional history than I am. But I hope I have at least made the case that roughly zero percent of how we now choose our presidents (including the “swing states” analysis with which I started) resembles anything in the original plan.

Wright was Tiger Woods of LPGA

Texto completo: html> PORT ST. LUCIE
Mickey Wright was the greatest women golfer.
She had the most perfect golf swing.
She was the most important player on the LPGA Tour.
I say all those things without having seen her play. I say all those things because that’s what the game’s greatest players said about her. Legends such as Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Kathy Whitworth.
Golf lost a big piece of history Monday when Mary Kathryn “Mickey” Wright died at 85 after a heart attack. She passed away in Port St. Lucie, where she had lived since 1974.
Mickey and I had a unique relationship. Not only had I never seen her play, I never met her.
I called her in 2003 when I was the golf writer for the Palm Beach Post and, much to my surprise, she answered the phone. I fully expected the call to
go to a recording and I would never hear back.
But there was Mickey’s voice. We chatted for a while, about Annika Sorenstam’s decision to play against the men in the PGA Tour’s Colonial tournament, about the sport and about her life. I was talking to a legend like she was a friend.
Mickey ended the conversation with a warning, however: “Craig, I’ll talk to you whenever you call, but if you ever try to come see me, I’ll never talk to you again.”
I never did try and find where Mickey lived, just off the Saints course in Club Med. I wasn’t stupid.
As I looked closer at her career and her life, I understood why she required her privacy. When she joined the LPGA Tour in 1955, it was barely a blip on anyone’s radar.
Few fans cared about women’s golf in the 1950s. But Mickey changed that. Her swing was so elegant, her game so tight, her mind so focused.
She was the Tiger Woods of the LPGA Tour. Fittingly, both have 82 career titles on their main tour and attended Stanford.
Mickey won 79 of her 82 career LPGA titles during a 12-year span from 1957-68, averaging 10 wins a season from 1960-64. She is the only woman to have held the four major titles at one time.
But the pressures to play and win every week forced Mickey to virtually retire at the age of 34. If Mickey didn’t play, nobody cared about the tournament.
Sound familiar?
All Mickey wanted to do was hit a golf ball, not stand in front of a microphone or a camera. When I asked her if she ever thought about playing against the men, like Annika was doing, I already knew the answer.
“Golf is show business today,” Wright said. “If you start with that premise, and believe in that, then anything goes. It’s hard to know how you feel when you’re being promoted by the promoters. I’m not into that.”
When Mickey played in her last official tournament in 1994, LPGA players flocked to her gallery when their round was over. It was like an opportunity to see the magical Oz. Mickey’s last public appearance was in 1996 – almost a quarter century before her death.
I knew how fortunate I was to be able to talk to Mickey on the phone. I didn’t call her often, maybe twice or three times a year, and would always learn something new about her.
Here’s one of her best golf tips: Mickey said Billy Casper, who like her grew up in San Diego, told her to practice putting at dusk, when you have to rely more on your feeling than your eyes.
Port St. Lucie was the perfect town for Mickey to spend the back nine of her life. It was quiet and peaceful, with a golf course out her back door. A ranger at the course once brought her a strip of synthetic turf so Mickey could hit balls without taking more than a few steps.
When my son Eric almost died in 2005 after a bacterial infection, Mickey wrote me a long letter saying how she was praying for Eric. Who writes letters anymore?
Two years later, I received a phone call from Mickey’s longtime manager, Peggy Wilson, who gave me some bad news: Mickey had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was undergoing surgery.
“Mickey might be mad at me for doing this, but I know she would want you to know,” Wilson said.
I broke the story about Mickey’s breast cancer, but there was no celebration for this national scoop.
Mickey recovered from the cancer and continued to play the stock market, do the New York Times crossword puzzle and watch golf on TV.
When she was named the 2010 Bob Jones Award winner, the USGA’s highest honor, I asked her if she would do an interview on a radio show I co-hosted.
Mickey hesitated, but finally said yes, only because she felt it would be good for the USGA. A few years later, I asked her to do another radio show. She said no. I never asked again.
It’s been more than a year since I heard Mickey’s voice, and I’m saddened I’ll never hear it again. I don’t think it was a coincidence I was covering the PGA Women’s Stroke Play Championship in Port St. Lucie on Monday, the day she passed.
She may have been the best woman player with the best swing and the pressure of the fledgling tour riding on her. But she was so much more.
She was one of golf’s greatest treasures.

FCC says 'one or more' wireless carriers have illegally disclosed location data

Texto completo: At least one wireless carrier in the United States has violated federal law by disclosing users' real-time location data to third parties without permission, according to the Federal Communications Commission.
"I am writing to follow up on my letter of December 3, 2019 regarding the status of the FCC’s investigation into the disclosure of consumers’ real-time location data," FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wrote in a letter. "Fulfilling the commitment I made in that letter, I wish to inform you that the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has completed its extensive investigation and that it has concluded that one or more wireless carriers apparently violated federal law."
Pai declined to name specific carriers, and when asked about the pending notice(s) of apparent liability for forfeiture that would be issued, the FCC said that it had no update and would generally not comment on law enforcement matters until they were adopted.
AT&T, one of the four largest wireless carriers in the U.S., is being sued for exactly that, however.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a civil lawsuit on behalf of AT&T customers in July 2019 seeking damages over the company disclosing real-time location data to third parties, which could then make that available to further third parties, with the data ending up in the hands of just about anyone if someone was willing to pay for it.
"The access to the carriers' real-time location, the carriers had provided that to a number of third parties and then those third parties had turned around and provided it to other downstream parties who then turned around and provided that access to others," said Aaron Mackey, a lawyer for the EFF. "We don't know exactly the technical and contractual relationship, that's what we're trying to find out in our lawsuit, but we know that there was sort of broad access such that, very far down the chain, a bunch of unscrupulous individuals and actors could obtain that information."
A Motherboard investigation published in January showed that a bounty hunter was able to pinpoint the approximate location of any given device, down to roughly 100 meters, with just a phone number and a few $100 bills. That means that anyone from car dealerships pursuing overdue payments to stalkers could shill out some extra cash and find whoever they were looking for. This was something that, at one point, all four of the major carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint) participated in.
Even the government has been using this data access to circumvent normal avenues of enforcement. From a small Missouri county sheriff (according to the New York Times) all the way up to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (according to the Wall Street Journal), people have gone through third parties to acquire a person's location without getting a warrant first.
The EFF says that Pai's letter is a boon to its civil suit, effectively proving that carriers betrayed the public trust illicitly by selling access to customers' locations.
"It's confirmation that the practices that were reported on were illegal under the Communications Act, and our lawsuit brings a claim under the Communications Act that these carriers can't disclose customers' location data without their affirmative consent," Mackey said. "Failure to abide by the law was illegal. We called on the FCC to investigate it and enforce it."
While the EFF, in addition to damages, is asking for the data to either be returned to AT&T or destroyed, the group acknowledges that it may be impossible to wrangle all the data that are out in the wild — which is to say, data of potentially 153 million AT&T subscribers. That's roughly 444 million people, counting reported users from the four largest carriers. That's more than the population of the U.S., as of 2018 estimates.
"There's no indication that there was any limit or segments of AT&T customers whose data was off-limits," Mackey said. "Anyone's data was potentially available to be disclosed and accessed by any party downstream who had the ability to get the data. Once the horse has left the barn, it's very hard to determine [who all had access to the data]."
While users are able to tell specific applications not to use location data, the way cellular technology functions today, it would be impossible to blanket "opt-out" of the collection of real-time location data without just outright not owning a smartphone.
"As we read the law, in respect to the data the carriers collect and generate, it's not an opt-out thing," Mackey said. "Customers shouldn't have to do anything. You shouldn't have to tell them, 'Don't disclose.' The law already prohibits disclosure absent the customer saying affirmatively, 'Yes, you can disclose.'"
The FCC has not put a timeline on when enforcement actions are expected to be adopted, if at all.
AT&T defended itself in May 2019 in a letter to the FCC, arguing that the specific data set being collected was not subject to the same restrictions of other location data.

Texto completo: President Trump pardoned seven people Tuesday, including financier Michael Milken and Bernard Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner, and commuted the sentences of four others, among them Rod Blagojevich, a former governor of Illinois. Here is a look at the lesser known people among the 11 who benefited from the executive grants of clemency that Trump signed Tuesday:
■ Ariel Friedler (pardon): Friedler, a technology entrepreneur whose product served millions of students, pleaded guilty in 2014 to conspiracy to access a protected computer without authorization and served two months in prison, according to a statement from the White House.
■ Tynice Nichole Hall (commutation): Hall, 36, was sentenced in 2006 after she was convicted on various drug charges in Lubbock, Texas, according to the Justice Department.
■ Crystal Munoz (commutation): Munoz was found guilty of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute marijuana in 2008, according to a petition filed by the Criminal Defense Clinic at the Texas A&M University School of Law.
■ Judith Negron (commutation): Negron, 48, was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2011 for her role in orchestrating a $205 million Medicare fraud scheme as the owner of a mental health care company in Miami.
■ Paul Pogue (pardon): In 2010, Pogue, the founder and former chief executive of a large construction company in Texas, was sentenced to three years of probation and was ordered to pay $723,000 in fines and restitution for filing false income tax statements, according to the McKinney Courier Gazette.
■ David Safavian (pardon): Safavian, the top federal procurement official under President George W. Bush, was sentenced to a year in prison in 2009 for covering up his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
■ Angela Stanton (pardon): Stanton, an author, television personality, and motivational speaker, served six months of home confinement in 2007 for her role in a stolen-vehicle ring. Her book “Lies of a Real Housewife: Tell the Truth and Shame the Devil" explores her difficult upbringing and her encounters with reality TV stars.

Texto completo: MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace is an inspiration to mediocrities everywhere.

If a network television burnout and former adviser to Sarah Palin’s failed vice presidential campaign can make it as the host of a cable news show, anyone can.
On Feb. 10, Wallace solemnly recited a series of tweets comparing the recent firing of career U.S. intelligence officials to the slaughter of six million Jews. The author of the tweets, the Brookings Institution’s Benjamin Wittes, “goes there,” Wallace promised her viewers, “putting the acts of revenge we’re seeing from Donald Trump in a provocative historical frame that you may or may not agree with, but it will make you think.”

I assure you, it does not “make you think.”

“First he came for [former FBI Director James Comey]," Wallace said, giving a word-for-word recitation of Wittes' Twitter thread, which is just a ham-fisted rewording of an old quote about complicity and the rise of the Third Reich, "and I said nothing because I was mad at Comey because of the Clinton email investigation and blamed him for Trump's election."

“Then he came to [former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe],” she continued, “and I said nothing because there was this inspector general report that said McCabe lacked candor.”

It goes on like this for another six tweets, the cable host all but tearing up at the thought of Comey and McCabe suffering the grave indignities of lucrative book and television deals.

This is not illuminating. This is not thought-provoking.

This is embarrassing (and maybe a little offensive).
NWIf you are surprised by Wallace's promotion of a style of political commentary that is as shallow as it is self-debasing, you shouldn’t be. Though she has a lot of competition at MSNBC, Wallace's program is one of the worst things on television precisely because of her deficiencies as a host and political commentator.

For starters, Wallace is vapid.

After Sen. Elizabeth Warren failed this month to capture even a single delegate in the 2020 New Hampshire primary, the MSNBC anchor declared the Massachusetts lawmaker a masterful campaigner, praising the senator for her willingness to take photos with supporters.

"She's a really, really, really good candidate," Wallace marveled, giving everyone a small insight into why the 2008 presidential election turned out the way it did.

Earlier, the cable news pundit told failed 2020 primary candidate Beto O’Rourke that it is “clear” he had “that thing that not all politicians have.” She then asked the former Texas congressman what the media can do better to cover his candidacy. Speaking of 2020 long shots, Wallace was also bullish on convicted felon Michael Avenatti, saying in 2018 that the disgraced lawyer "hit a lot of the right notes" when he tested the electoral waters in Iowa. Democrats "would be foolish to underestimate” him, she said.

Both of Avenatti’s lawsuits against President Trump were thrown out the next year. The disgraced attorney’s client, who alleges now that Avenatti stole nearly $300,000 from her, was also ordered by a judge to pay $300,000 in Trump's legal fees.

Speaking of utter failures, Wallace claimed elsewhere that a group of children with Twitter accounts was going to change federal gun laws and bring the National Rifle Association to heel. Obviously, this did not happen, which brings us to the next point: Wallace’s show suffers for her general ignorance.

She claimed once that the Second Amendment was created for the purpose of fighting “foreign militias.” Not even close. She said the Parkland shooting was a news story mostly because “17 white kids were” killed. The 17 victims, who were not all white, included three adults. In attacking MSNBC’s right-leaning news rivals, Wallace alleged that the Obama administration never had a “network distorting the truth” on its behalf. She must have slept through all of the 2012 presidential election. Wallace also claimed that the president shared a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Trump did not share the doctored video. In January 2019, Wallace said there “isn't a strain of racism on the Left,” which is an exceptionally ignorant assertion considering noted anti-Semite Al Sharpton is still a hotly sought after Democratic kingmaker.

Wallace said in January 2019 that the White House’s contention that there is a crisis at the border is part of a “big scam,” adding bluntly that there is “not a crisis.” Not much later, after reading a New York Times article, Wallace announced there is a "humanitarian crisis" at the border.

The MSNBC host, who once referred to the Second Amendment right to bear arms as a “so-called right,” even mistook the sound of a can of soda being opened for gunshots during a live broadcast.

This leads to yet another one of Wallace’s shortcomings as an anchor and pundit, which is her love of fearmongering.
In August 2019, for example, she claimed Trump was paving the way for the total extermination of Latinos. Wallace told viewers that Trump may try to imprison journalists if he wins reelection in 2020. She claimed the president would have "blood on his hands" if minority members of Congress ever fall victim to a "racially inspired attack." Wallace also compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, claiming the president’s embrace of the term “nationalist” is just like what happened in Nazi Germany.

“I watch enough History Channel to know that they cheered at Hitler, too,” Wallace said.

But the thing that really inspires fremdschämen, moreso even than Wallace's vapidity, ignorance, and garish doomsday predictions, is her penchant for pettiness.

“How do you resist the temptation to run up and wring [former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders’s] neck?” the anchor asked NBC News' Kristen Welker in May 2018.

Wallace wondered elsewhere how the Trump women can stand by the men in their lives, suggesting they are either “paid off” or “dead inside.” The MSNBC host asked twice over the course of an hour in a later episode whether Republicans are “dead inside.” Wallace once spent an entire segment mocking Vice President Mike Pence’s posture, giggling and mining his body language for unflattering clues or meaning. Wallace even declared former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, “chicken soup” for her soul, explaining that one of his many outbursts directed at Pence made her “feel better."

Why, after all of this, would MSNBC waste so much valuable airtime on someone who is so obviously unfit for the job?

The dirty secret is this: Wallace does not have a show because of her trenchant political analysis or her supposed connections. She has not been involved directly in GOP politics or a campaign since 2008. Wallace has a show on MSNBC because she offers more of what its viewers want, but with the added twist that she has the word “Republican” somewhere in her title. Media love anti-Republican “Republicans” because supposed GOP “insiders” such as Wallace provide audiences with the spectacle of red-on-red violence. It does not matter that her commentary is indistinguishable from what her colleagues at MSNBC have to say, with the added downside that it is also pedestrian. Wallace, who says she will "gladly and easily" vote for socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the 2020 general election should he win the Democratic nomination, attacks the Right with her lifetime credential as a “Republican,” and that makes for good drama.

Unfortunately for the viewing public, the contrived drama is about all that Wallace has to offer.

The woman whose career before MSNBC includes a failed run as a co-host on The View and a failed run as an adviser to a failed GOP presidential campaign is now a top host on MSNBC, and all because she markets herself as an anti-Republican “Republican." Never mind the fact that Sarah Palin’s former adviser rarely, if ever, has anything interesting to say.

Wallace is a professional “Republican” who parrots the news industry’s generally held beliefs about the Right, and that, apparently, is good enough to win her a spot anchoring a politics news show.

E Jean Carroll blames Trump for getting fired from Elle Magazine

Texto completo: E. Jean Carroll, the writer and columnist who accused President Trump of raping her, was fired from Elle Magazine and is blaming the president for her termination.
Carroll announced she was fired on social media Tuesday, writing, "Because Trump ridiculed my reputation, laughed at my looks, & dragged me through the mud, after 26 years, ELLE fired me. I don't blame Elle. It was the great honor of my life writing 'Ask E. Jean.' I blame @realdonaldtrump."
In an email from Elle Executive Managing Editor Erin Hobday to Carroll, which was included in a court filing by Carroll's lawyer, Hobday explained that the outlet would pay her for the remaining time left on her contract, according to the New York Times.
“We and your readers so appreciate your many years of work for the magazine, and the wonderful columns you contributed to our publication,” Hobday wrote, adding, “We will miss you tremendously.”

The columnist, 76, came forward in June and accused Trump of raping her nearly 25 years ago. According to a memoir published last year, Carroll and Trump met at Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996. She alleges that they talked and shopped together in the department store before he briefly penetrated her in a dressing room without her consent.
The president has denied the accusations from Carroll, going as far as to say that she made up the claim to sell her book.
“Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda,” he said when allegation was made public. “It is a disgrace and people should pay dearly for such false accusations.”
Trump also claimed that he's "never met this person before in my life" despite the two appearing together in a photograph from a 1987 party.
In addition to the rape allegation, Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit against the president last November for claiming that she lied about the incident. She has also requested a DNA sample from Trump in order to determine if his genetic material matches that of the dress she wore at the time of the alleged attack.

Nail them down: Three questions moderators ought to ask Democrats at tonight's debate

Texto completo: When it comes to dealing with the media, running as a Democrat is simply easier than running as a Republican.
Whereas journalists are naturally suspicious of everything Republicans say, they tend to lack healthy skepticism when it comes to Democratic claims. Just to give a quick example of this, when the New York Times ran a predebate fact check on Pete Buttigieg going into the debate, it failed to list any of his factually dubious claims, except for those that directly criticize other Democratic candidates.
So tonight, the NBC/MSNBC moderators in Las Vegas have a chance to pin down the leading Democratic candidates on issues where either they've been slippery with the facts or where their extreme views haven't been challenged. There are plenty, but here are the three most important.
1) You keep saying the Trump-era economy has not worked for the average American or the working man. Why do you say this, given that unemployment is very low, men are reentering the workforce in impressive numbers, and wages are not only rising, but rising fastest for the bottom quartile of workers?
Buttigieg loves to say recent economic gains are good for the wealthy but that the money doesn't end up on regular people's kitchen tables. Tom Steyer, who won't be in tonight's debate, makes the same assertion, claiming that today's economy works only for "the 1%." Elizabeth Warren claimed at one point that the current economy was only good for wealthy investors in private prison, drug, and oil stocks — a claim that was false in every possible way.
The data show that the bottom quartile of earners is seeing more wage gains than any of the higher quartiles. Inflation is low, and wages are rising across the board. Unemployment is incredibly low — significantly lower than economists once believed possible. Out-of-work men are rejoining the labor force.
Moderators should ask the candidates to justify their specific claims about the economy.
2) Do you think Jack Phillips, Catholic hospitals that won't perform abortion, and the Little Sisters of the Poor are simply using their "religion as an excuse" to harm people, as Pete Buttigieg puts it? Or do you think there are serious conscience objections that the government should respect?
The Democratic field is pretty extreme in its opposition to religious liberty. Candidates not only oppose any accommodation for conscience rights, they assert flatly that such claims are dishonest cover stories for rank bigotry or attempts to harm gays and women.
The candidates' extremism on these issues should be flushed out so that voters of faith know what to expect if any of these Democrats becomes president.
3) Do you worry that anti-Semitism is a growing force in the Democratic Party?
Every Republican is always asked to account for the most racially insensitive or racist comments by any Republican congressman. Democrats should be called on to address the open flirtation with anti-Semitism by Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.
These questions would enlighten the public on important issues and press candidates on their factual slipperiness.

Democrats silent on Mike Bloomberg's long record of Islamophobia

Texto completo: During the 2016 Republican presidential primary, one of the worst things then-candidate Donald Trump announced was his support for an all-out ban on Muslims entering the country. (Thankfully, he hasn't fully gone through with it as president.) His competitor, Sen. Ted Cruz, wasn’t much better in terms of respecting the civil liberties of Muslim Americans, supporting on the campaign trail a plan to “empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.”
Elected Democrats and liberal media outlets rightly attacked both proposals as discriminatory and bigoted. Now, lest they fully collapse into partisan hypocrisy, Democrats must offer the same unequivocal condemnation of 2020 presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg’s long-standing support for discriminatory, anti-Muslim policies.
So far, they've been eerily quiet. While attacks on Bloomberg were plentiful at Wednesday night's Democratic debate, the subject of his Islamophobia never came up. But there's a lot there.
In the years after 9/11, while Bloomberg was mayor, the New York City Police Department engaged in a disturbing practice in which officers regularly monitored the online activity of Muslim student groups at 16 different universities. The police arbitrarily sought out and monitored citizens on the basis of their religion, without evidence linking them to criminal activity. Then the mayor of New York City, Bloomberg defended the Islamophobic practice.
The police abuses under Bloomberg went far beyond mere digital monitoring, too.
According to the Associated Press, “the NYPD placed informants or undercover officers in the Muslim Student Associations at City College, Brooklyn College, Baruch College, Hunter College, City College of New York, Queens College, La Guardia Community College and St. John's University.” The news organization also noted that the police department “documents mention no wrongdoing by any students” that could justify such an invasion of their civil liberties and privacy.
There’s so much more. The Intercept summarized New York City’s anti-Islam practices well:
During Bloomberg’s three-term tenure as mayor of New York, the NYPD worked with the CIA to deploy teams of undercover agents, known as "rakers," into Muslim neighborhoods to gather information. "They’ve monitored daily life in bookstores, bars, cafes and nightclubs," reported the AP. "Police have also used informants, known as ‘mosque crawlers,’ to monitor sermons, even when there’s no evidence of wrongdoing. NYPD officials have scrutinized imams and gathered intelligence on cab drivers and food cart vendors, jobs often done by Muslims." The AP also noted that on one occasion officials "even sent an undercover agent on a whitewater rafting trip, where he recorded students’ names and noted in police intelligence files how many times they prayed." The NYPD, added the New York Times, "eavesdropped on thousands of conversations between Muslims in restaurants and stores in New York City and New Jersey and on Long Island." Paid informants were "under orders to ‘bait’ Muslims into saying inflammatory things."
Bloomberg has defended many of these practices, which happened under his watch as mayor. And unlike his now-recanted support for the racist policing tactic of "stop and frisk," he has not apologized for supporting blatantly Islamophobic policies.
So far, it seems like most of the media and Democratic establishment are letting Bloomberg get away with his decadeslong record of support for anti-Muslim policies. Why the silence?
Perhaps it has something to do with the hundreds of millions of dollars Bloomberg has donated to liberal causes and Democratic campaigns. When you fund Democrats, apparently you get held to different standards — and get to play by different rules.

Texto completo: A Mexican citizen living in Singapore was arrested in Miami this week on charges of working as a foreign agent for Russia and for tailing a U.S. government source.
Hector Alejandro Cabrera Fuentes was arrested by the FBI on Monday after being stopped at Miami International Airport on Sunday evening on his way to Mexico City. In a still-sealed complaint, he was charged by the Justice Department with “acting within the United States on behalf of a foreign government (Russia), without notifying the Attorney General, and conspiracy to do the same.”

Fuentes was recruited by the Russians in 2019, according to reports.
The Miami Herald, which viewed the criminal affidavit, reported that Fuentes was accused of working for an official with Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service. The confidential human source whom Fuentes spied on worked for the FBI’s counterintelligence division, providing “information on Russian spying activities in South Florida.”

The Miami Herald said Fuentes had two wives, one in Mexico and one in Russia, and that Fuentes said his Russian handler promised to help get his Russian wife and her two daughters out of Russia.
“We can help each other,” the Russian reportedly told Fuentes.
Last Thursday, Fuentes, who has a business and tourism visa, arrived in Miami from Mexico City with his Mexican wife. On Friday, a security guard at the apartment building where the FBI source lived approached Fuentes’s rental car after it tailgated its way into the condominium complex. Fuentes’s wife hopped out of the car and took a picture of the license plate of the source’s vehicle. When questioned by the guard about their actions, Fuentes allegedly provided a fake name, and the guard told them to leave.
When the duo was stopped at the airport on their way out of the country two days later, U.S. Customs and Border Protection looked at the phone of Fuentes’s wife and discovered a close-up image of the source’s license plate in her phone’s folder of recently deleted images, and Fuentes admitted to authorities that he’d asked her to take the picture. A review of Fuentes’s phone showed his wife sent him the picture via WhatsApp, and Fuentes told investigators that “he was directed by a Russian government official to conduct this operation.”
“Messages on Fuentes’s phone showed that the Russian official initiated and directed the meetings,” the DOJ said.
The Russian official reportedly recruited Fuentes last year and directed him to rent a specific apartment in Miami-Dade County, instructing him not to do so in his own name and not to tell his family about their discussions. According to documents, Fuentes traveled to Moscow last year to confirm he’d made the arrangements, and the Russian approved and told Fuentes to see him again the next time he was in Russia. Fuentes traveled to Moscow again in February.
“At this meeting, the Russian government official provided Fuentes with a physical description of a U.S. government source’s vehicle and told Fuentes to locate the car, obtain the source’s vehicle license plate number, and note the physical location of the source’s vehicle,” the DOJ said. “The Russian official instructed Fuentes to meet the Russian official again in April or May 2020, to inform him of the results of the search for the source’s vehicle.”
It is not known how the Russian intelligence agent knew about the confidential human source, and further details about the purpose of the surveillance and the broader plot were not revealed by the DOJ.
During a brief magistrate hearing on Tuesday, Fuentes revealed he “had bank accounts and jobs in different parts of the world” and “was making $7,500 a month as a researcher at the National University of Singapore and another $5,000 a month from a part-time job with an Israeli company in Germany, along with holding about $100,000 in bank accounts in Mexico, Singapore, and the United States,” according to the Miami Herald.
Fuentes said he couldn’t access the money, though, so the magistrate assigned him a temporary public defender. He's being held as a flight risk.
A pretrial detention hearing is set for Friday in Miami, and Fuentes will be arraigned March 3.
FBI Director Christopher Wray warned about Russian espionage efforts while testifying before Congress earlier this month.

This isn’t the first time a Russia-connected source made headlines. One day after President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr “full and complete” declassification authority to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation in May 2019, the New York Times published a piece about a source “long-nurtured by the CIA.”

Reports by CNN and others in September 2019 about the alleged source’s 2017 exfiltration from Russia eventually exposed his identity and revealed he was living in the Washington area. He since has been moved.

Texto completo: Today, Feb. 19, the leading Democratic candidates for president will take the debate stage in Las Vegas, three days before the Nevada caucuses. This will be the race’s ninth debate, and many voters may be tempted to skip the show. That would be a mistake.
While many of the candidates and their sales pitches are by now familiar — in some cases painfully so — this will be the debate debut of Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire business mogul and former mayor of New York who has been promoting himself, with the help of his personal fortune, as the one player with “the record & the resources” to topple President Donald Trump.
Despite not competing in the first four voting contests, Bloomberg has emerged as a top-tier contender, sowing anxiety and uncertainty among his rivals. A national poll released Tuesday showed him at 19% among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, second only to Bernie Sanders. Other recent polls show him leading the field in Florida and tied for first in Virginia.
Rarely has a candidate come so far while revealing so little of himself, making Wednesday’s debate — the first time Bloomberg will face his primary competitors live and in person — far more significant, and interesting, than most.
Bloomberg sauntered into the race in late November, long after most of the field, and has run an unconventional campaign. He didn’t enter the early primaries and caucuses, and he has focused his energies — and his spending — on the diverse, delegate-rich states scheduled to vote on March 3, aka Super Tuesday.
It is a strategy made possible by the $61.8 billion fortune with which he is self-funding his run. That kind of money can buy an essentially unlimited number of campaign ads — including an $11 million Super Bowl spot — along with a boatload of strategists, staffers and support from local politicians and other influencers. It can also help build vital infrastructure, from local campaign offices to national databases. In less than three months, Bloomberg has dropped over $400 million.
Even as he has overwhelmed the field with his spending, Bloomberg has avoided many of the traditional hoops presidential hopefuls are expected to jump through. He skipped the endless retail politicking — the diner stops, county fairs and pancake breakfasts — that comes with wooing voters in early states like Iowa and New Hampshire.
He is not much for media sit-downs. (He declined an invitation by The New York Times’ editorial board to participate in its endorsement process.) He has not been involved in the televised town halls at which candidates have been detailing their policy positions. And, of course, he missed the first eight debates, letting him avoid much of the early bloodletting.
More specifically, Bloomberg was not eligible for the earlier debates, which required candidates to show a certain level of fundraising support. The Democratic National Committee jettisoned that rule last month, enabling him to participate if he met the threshold of scoring 10% in four qualifying polls, which he did.
Already, there is much buzz about which of Bloomberg’s anxious competitors will hit him the hardest, and how he will respond. If this week’s skirmish with the Sanders campaign is any indication, the evening could get bumpy. Bloomberg has a reputation for not taking criticism or unwelcome queries particularly well, once calling a reporter whose question he disliked “a disgrace.” During his mayoral runs, he participated in at least eight debates. He tended to come prepared, data at hand, although he could be prickly and awkward at times. His last turn on a debate stage was in 2009.
Beyond the candidate clashes, this will be debate moderators’ first opportunity to kick the tires on Bloomberg’s candidacy. They owe it to the public to do a thorough and vigorous job.
Presumably, he will come ready to answer the most overarching criticism: that he is trying to buy the presidency. And he can expect a grilling over his controversial use of stop-and-frisk policing — largely with young black and Hispanic men — while mayor. His apologizing for the practice as he began his campaign struck many as a tad cynical. At the very least, he’ll most likely face some follow-up queries, such as: What took you so long?
There is so much more to explore, both promising — like his new plan to address the cost and quality of college — and troubling — for instance, the widespread surveillance of Muslims by local law enforcement during his time as mayor.
In case the moderators are stuck for material, here are a few lines of inquiry to consider:
Bloomberg used to be a Republican and, over the years, supported numerous Republican candidates at the state and federal levels. Why should Democrats trust him to champion their values as president?
He once linked the financial collapse to measures taken to deal with the damages of redlining, the practice of banks denying home loans in minority neighborhoods. Does he still believe that?
He has been a longtime champion of gun control. How would he pursue reform if Republicans retain control of the Senate?
Once upon a time he opposed increasing the minimum wage, a move he now supports. What changed his mind?
Homelessness in New York surged on his watch. What lessons did he learn from this, and what would his housing policy be as president?
Multiple women who worked for his company accused him of inappropriate or demeaning comments. He has refused to release them from the nondisclosure agreements they signed. Why?
Considering all that we don’t know about Bloomberg, his grilling could run for the entire debate. And maybe it should. He is, after all, looking to disrupt not only this Democratic field but the entire nominating process. This debate and the one in South Carolina next Tuesday may be the only two opportunities for the broader public to get a real sense of him before Super Tuesday.
Compelling arguments can be, and have been, marshaled for and against Bloomberg. Is he a narcissistic ex-Republican with Big Brotherish tendencies and a sketchy record on race who is trying to buy the presidency? Is he the battle-tested, successful leader of the nation’s largest city whose business savvy and personal fortune make him especially well-suited to dismantle Trump? Perhaps he is a bit of both.
No one really knows yet. But if he is to move even a step closer to the White House, voters deserve a clearer picture of his candidacy. That process begins Wednesday night.

Texto completo: Thirty years ago this summer, I spent two weeks backpacking across Philmont, a 140,000-acre expanse of northeastern New Mexico owned by the Boy Scouts of America. Most people who trek Philmont say it changed their life; it certainly changed mine. A few years later, I became an Eagle Scout — still one of my proudest achievements.
On Tuesday, the Boy Scouts of America filed for bankruptcy, seeking, in part, protection from mounting costs involving several hundred sexual abuse lawsuits. The filing is a defensive move, and the organization may yet survive. But enrollment is plummeting and sponsors are dropping out; the future doesn’t look good.
For a long time, I’ve wrestled with some complicated feelings about the Boy Scouts. My personal experiences, and the ideas of scouting — blending self-reliance with community, practical skills with a republican civic philosophy — made me who I am. But “scouting,” a global, century-old movement, is different from the Boy Scouts of America, the organization based in Irving, Tex., that for decades has apparently covered up the risk of sexual abuse at the expense of thousands of young boys.
[ Read more: Utah Scouting will shrink and change with the exit of the LDS Church, but supporters say it will survive ]
Scouting is a valuable, even vital idea; the Boy Scouts, though, is quite toxic. For scouting to survive, the Boy Scouts of America may have to go.
The Boy Scouts of America was founded in 1910, and almost from the beginning it has had a sexual abuse problem. Since at least the 1940s, it kept a list of red flag cases — known, grotesquely, as the “perversion files” — which were supposed to block abusers from further participation in Scouts. But the list didn’t do its job, nor did it save the organization from a steady drip of lawsuits.
Until recently, most of those cases were settled quietly out of court, so it’s hard to say how many there were, or how much the Boy Scouts paid the plaintiffs. But in 2010, a court in Portland, Ore., ordered the Boy Scouts to pay $1.4 million to a man who was abused by a scout leader, Timur Dykes, in the 1980s. During that trial about 1,000 red-flag files were introduced as evidence, though only the jury and lawyers were allowed to see them. The Boy Scouts at the time denied allegations of negligence but in 2012, it was forced to make public thousands of pages of documents from those files.
In an echo of the scandals in the Roman Catholic Church, the files show that the national organization often allowed scout leaders accused of abuse, including Mr. Dykes, to continue working with boys. The files also indicate that complaints about abusive adults were shot down by officials more interested in protecting the organization’s image than rooting out injustice.
The Portland case unleashed hell on the Boy Scouts. Along with a cascade of lawsuits over individual abuse claims, several former scouts are suing the organization for access to all the perversion files, which they say contain the names of 7,819 men who abused boys under their charge, along with 12,254 victims. Last year, to raise money, the Boy Scouts mortgaged Philmont, the crown jewel of the scouting kingdom.
It’s hard to square all this with the scouting I remember. My troop, in Nashville, was sponsored by a local congregation of the Disciples of Christ, a liberal, mainline denomination with just a bit more Jesus than the Unitarian Universalists. Our adult leaders were good men — funny, kind, wise, gruff — and the boys came from all around: white, black, brown, well off, working class. We hiked, we goofed off, we got away from our parents and we became like brothers.
For a long time, I’ve leaned on this particular experience to justify the general — whatever bad apples might be found in other troops, mine was proof that the organization was good at heart. The Boy Scouts have done the same, in reverse. After the Dykes trial, a Boy Scouts spokesman said, “The actions of the man who committed these crimes do not represent the values and ideals of the Boy Scouts of America.”
That may be true. But in 2020, it’s beside the point. Too many bad apples raise unavoidable questions about the orchard they came from. And while the Boy Scouts has done an admirable job of reform — owning up to its failures, admitting openly gay scouts and leaders, planning a compensation fund for victims — it still doesn’t feel like enough. Even if the Boy Scouts manages to get through this crisis financially, what possible reform could win back the public trust?
Is it possible to have scouting without the Boy Scouts? Of course it is, just as we don’t need the NFL to play football.
Scouting began in Britain, under the leadership of Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, a career army officer. In 1908 he founded the Boy Scouts; two years later he and his sister created the Girl Guides.
The movement spread quickly, with national organizations sprouting from North America, where the Boy Scouts of America opened in 1910, to Southeast Asia — today, Indonesia has by far the largest, with some 17 million members. Each national organization had to follow some basic parameters set by Baden-Powell, but otherwise was free to set its own rules. Some, like the Boy Scouts of America, exclude atheists; many don’t. Others have always been coed; the Boy Scouts didn’t admit girls until 2018.
The Boy Scouts is by far the largest scouting organization in America, but historically, it hasn’t been the only one. The same year it was founded, a rival organization, the American Boy Scouts, began under the leadership of William Randolph Hearst (it folded in the 1920s). More recently, the Baden-Powell Service Association has emerged as a coed, nonreligious alternative to the Boy Scouts. And of course there’s the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., founded in 1912 as the American branch of the Girl Guides.
At its height in the early 1970s, the Boy Scouts claimed more than four million youth; now it’s down to about 2.2 million. That’s a significant decline, but it’s still about twice as many boys as play high school football. The Girl Scouts has 1.7 million youth members.
Clearly, there’s a demand for something like Boy Scouts. There’s also a need.
Scouting is inclusive, in a way that belies the stereotypes and makes it an antidote to the racial and economic siloing so common today. Scouts wear uniforms not to play soldier, but to step outside their social roles — to become equals.
At its core, scouting offers a dual education in civics and self-reliance. Scouting is where I learned the importance of voting, conservation and civil rights. I also learned to pitch a tent, tie knots, purify water, climb a cliff and perform CPR. It’s this combo of values and skills, and the overarching idea that they go hand in hand, that makes scouting so valuable.
I’m grateful to the Boy Scouts. But while my adult leaders were teaching me how to tie a bowline hitch, adult leaders in other troops were preying on boys like me. Maybe it’s not about a few bad apples; maybe I was just lucky.
I won’t take the same risk with my children. Fortunately, I don’t have to. My wife and I recently enrolled them in the Baden-Powell Service Association. We love it. They get outdoors, go camping, learn about their community.
It’s progressive — coed, secular — and maybe not for everyone. Still, as a vision for what scouting could look like after the Boy Scouts, it’s heartening. With its bankruptcy, the Boy Scouts of America may have entered its final chapter. But as my children will tell you, the joy of scouting continues.

Texto completo: Donald Trump is who he is as a politician because of his unapologetically racial vision of the American nation. Trump’s America is white, and he sees his job as protecting that whiteness from black and brown people who might come to the country or claim greater status within it. That’s what it meant to “make America great again.” And he’s delivered, using the power of the office and the force of the state to attack and stigmatize black and brown people, from outspoken celebrities to ordinary immigrants.
If that’s our lens for understanding Trump — if the heart of his movement and ideology is racial control — then it appears we finally have a Democratic equivalent, a figure who works on the same signal albeit at a different frequency. It’s Michael Bloomberg, the other New York billionaire in American politics, who is currently campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination.
There are clear objections to thinking of Bloomberg this way. He may have been a Republican, but he’s also a liberal. He has given hundreds of millions of dollars to liberal causes and Democratic politicians. He spent more than $100 million helping Democrats take control of the House of Representatives in 2018. He’s also given tens of millions of dollars to environmental groups and spent millions more lobbying for new gun control laws. He’s given to Democratic super PACs and voting rights groups, individual politicians and the Democratic National Committee itself. And while he is an imperious personality with a disdain for limits — he got the rules changed so he could serve a third term as mayor of New York — he also doesn’t share the president’s criminality, corruption and complete contempt for constitutional government.
But he does share one important quality.
Although he never articulated it in these terms, Bloomberg’s actions as mayor reveal that he was someone who also saw black and brown people as threats to the security and prosperity of his territory, New York. And under his administration, the city became a quasi-authoritarian state for many of its black, brown and Muslim residents.
Bloomberg, as many before me have explored in detail, expanded the New York Police Department’s use of “stop and frisk,” a tactic that empowered police officers to stop, search and interrogate residents on the sole basis of “reasonable suspicion.” Overall, between 2004 and 2012, the NYPD — which Bloomberg once called his “own army” while also weirdly claiming that it was the “seventh biggest army in the world” — stopped 4.4 million New York residents. The vast majority, more than 80%, were black and brown people, especially young men and boys. In 2011, according to a contemporaneous report by the New York Civil Liberties Union, police stopped more young black men than the total number living in the city. “By the time I was 15 to 18, I’d say I was stopped, questioned and frisked at least 60 to 70 times,” Tyquan Brehon, a young Brooklyn resident, said in a 2012 interview with The New York Times.
Bloomberg had no time for this criticism. “If we stopped people based on census numbers, we would stop many fewer criminals, recover many fewer weapons and allow many more violent crimes to take place,” he said in 2012. He said as much again in 2015 at an Aspen Institute event. “Ninety-five percent of your murders — murderers and murder victims — fit one MO. You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25. That’s true in New York, that’s true in virtually every city.”
He continued: “People say, ‘Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana who are all minorities.’ Yes, that’s true. Why? Because we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. Yes, that’s true. Why’d we do it? Because that’s where all the crime is. And the way you should get the guns out of the kids’ hands is throw them against the wall and frisk them.”
Bloomberg was wrong about the efficacy of stop and frisk. According to a 2013 report from the public advocate’s office (then run by the current mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio), stopping a black New Yorker was half as likely to yield a weapon as stopping a white New Yorker, and one-third as likely to yield drugs and other contraband. The reason was simple. A disproportionate number of those convicted of violent crime may have been young men of color, but the vast majority of young men of color weren’t involved in violent crime or any crime at all. Stopping someone on the basis of race was a recipe for false positives; stopping on the basis of actual suspicious behavior, on the other hand, would yield results, which is what happened when police stopped white residents.
But Bloomberg didn’t care to get it right. He believed that to stop crime he had to control the city’s black and brown people. And that’s what he did, without apology or remorse, until it was politically necessary to express regret.
Muslims received similar treatment. Under Bloomberg, the NYPD spied on and surveilled New York Muslims, using both informants and undercover agents to gather information from inside mosques and restaurants, neighborhoods and social groups. Police tracked students, photographed worshippers and used census data to map the geography of Muslim life in the city. It was, like stop and frisk, a flagrant violation of civil liberties even if it was technically legal. And Bloomberg was equally unapologetic. “We have to keep this country safe,” he said, addressing questions about the program after it was uncovered by The Associated Press.
Bloomberg has apologized for stop and frisk (although not for spying on New York’s Muslim communities). However, there’s no indication that he has really changed; no evidence that he’s dropped the commitment to racial control. But even if he has, liberals outraged at Trump’s racism should feel similar anger toward Bloomberg’s record in New York. They should be appalled by a man who, when he was entrusted with the power of the state, used it to terrorize innocent people on the basis of race and religion.
And in the same way that liberals fear for the future of democracy under four more years of Trump, they should fear for the implications of giving four years, period, to Bloomberg. Given his record, he’s someone who might try to consolidate Trumpism — moderating its hostilities into less disruptive form — rather than reject it wholesale.
Yes, Bloomberg might be the one to beat Trump at the ballot box. But he’s also the one who might put a Trumpist stamp on American liberalism.

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren plans a sixth campaign stop in Colorado. She's trying to save her floundering campaign before Super Tuesday on March 3.
As she loses momentum, media allies try to make her a victim. Don't believe it. Warren did this to herself.
Here are samples of the Warren-as-victim claim.
"Warren seems to have unfairly inherited some of the hallmarks of Hillary Clinton's reputation. Clinton's devastating 2016 upset sparked practical questions as to whether a woman could win the presidency at all," explains a Feb. 12 article in The Week titled "The sidelining of Elizabeth Warren."
Washington Monthly published a Feb. 15 article titled "Warren Is Paying the Price for her Honesty. And Her Gender."
"Warren's basic decency and honesty have cost her" the article claims. "And the sexism undergirding much of the conversation around electability hasn't helped."
Her "honesty"? Oh, yes, like the time she falsely claimed her father was a janitor. Or the conflicting stories about getting fired for getting pregnant. Or, that thing about "I'm a Native American."
The latter brings us to the dress.
In the spring of 2018, Keziah Daum wore a Chinese-style dress to her prom in Suburban Salt Lake City. The teenager snapped a few selfies and posted them on social media. All hell broke loose.
"Teenager's Prom Dress Stirs Furor in U.S. -- but Not in China," said a New York Times headline over a story about insensitive cultural appropriation by white people.
" 'It's just a dress': Teen's Chinese prom attire stirs cultural appropriation debate," said a Washington Post headline.
Insider magazine published an article titled "This is why a white woman wearing and traditional Chinese dress is cultural appropriation."
The teenager "was able to wear the dress she did without mockery -- because of the power and privilege that her whiteness affords her. And in a country where Asian people are marginalized, the decision for a white woman to wear a dress would be considered cultural appropriation -- not cultural appreciation."
The U.K's Independent covered the dress with a headline that said: "There is no such thing as 'harmless' cultural appropriation..."
Pundits and news media obsessed over the dress for days, generating attention from nearly all major newspapers, TV networks, and radio talk shows. Somehow it was a big deal for a teenager to wear a dress with Chinese patterns.
When the Kansas City Chiefs made it to this year's Super Bowl, media quickly launched a grievance narrative about the team's mascot inappropriately exploiting Native American culture.
The left's enforcers of identity politics -- people Warren needs to win the Democratic primary -- have made "cultural appropriation" a veritable felony offense of the unwritten sensitivity code.
Warren did not wear the wrong dress to a dance one night in high school. Magnitudes worse, she spent much of her adult life checking boxes that said she was a Native American. She checked the boxes despite leading a lifestyle the identity politics movement would view as "white privilege."
Warren's declared identity was important to Harvard Law School, whose overlords wanted to believe it. The school was under scrutiny for lacking minority hires. Upon hiring Warren, the school went public to boast of hiring a "woman of color." Problem solved.
Warren went with the "woman of color" narrative for years, never having endured the challenges inherent to minority life. Warren took a job that might otherwise have gone to someone who grew up with all the challenges of dark skin or life on a reservation. Her misappropriation of identity may have taken from someone else an affirmative-action benefit.
The Democratic base cannot nominate Warren. Doing so would mock the cause of cultural and ethnic sensitivity -- a loud-and-clear element of the party's values. That conundrum, not gender, likely explains Warren's third-place ranking heading into Nevada.

A SEARCH FOR PROPORTION, CIVILITY IN TODAY'S CULTURE; EDITOR'S COLUMN

Texto completo: On the Sunday in January that Kobe Bryant died, an ESPN announcer said we would someday remember where and when we heard the news in the way that people old enough recalled President John F. Kennedy's assassination.
Really, the death of a basketball star being equated with the murder of the leader of the free world?
As a young boy, I recall the JFK assassination transforming the world and hearing something similar being said. That day in 1963, television anchorman Chet Huntley said "probably few living Americans" watching did not find themselves remembering how they felt when they heard that another president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had died suddenly 18 years earlier.
That, at least, felt like apples to apples.
But my intent is not to criticize the heartfelt social media remembrances and continuing ceremonies honoring Bryant, his daughter, and the others who died on that helicopter. Nor is it to downplay the exceptional journalism that has followed it, highlighted by a recent New York Times story describing Bryant's final hours in granular detail.
Mine is more a commentary on how much the culture has changed.
Let me explain.
Compare the aftermath of Bryant's death with that of Roberto Clemente, who died on New Year's Eve in 1972. Clemente was a Puerto Rican baseball superstar who was killed in a plane crash while on a mercy mission.
After a severe earthquake had devastated Nicaragua, Clemente organized Puerto Rico's response. He was angered that Nicaragua's dictatorship was diverting aid shipments, so he chartered an airplane to bring badly needed supplies. Shortly after takeoff, it crashed into the sea. His body was never recovered.
Clemente was a Bryant-sized superstar of his day who played his entire career for the Pittsburgh Pirates. I saw him in person at Chicago's Wrigley Field and once witnessed him throw out a runner at third base from deep right field. To my eyes, it appeared that his long-distance and laser-accurate throw was never more than 12 feet from the ground, a jaw-dropping display.
Clemente was an all-time great player - inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame less than a year after his death and arguably the first Latino so honored - but he had a much broader cultural significance. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest honor given to civilians.
Author (and part-time Madison resident) David Maraniss captured the essence of Clemente's appeal in his deeply reported 2006 biography of him. While most baseball legends are rooted in nostalgia, Maraniss wrote, "Clemente's myth arcs the other way, to the future, not the past, to what people hope they can become. His memory is kept alive as a symbol of action and passion, not of reflection and longing. He broke racial and language barriers and achieved greatness and died a hero."
In the newspaper coverage of Clemente's death, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was exhaustive. It filled six inside pages with tributes and pictures. Elsewhere, though, while it was treated as big news, mostly it was - as we say in the business - a one-day story.
Clemente's name actually came up after Bryant's death in a story by a New York Times sportswriter about how sports teammates coped with earlier losses. It was headlined: " 'There's No Playbook': Recalling the Pain of Lost Teammates."
So what is my point in this Bryant-Clemente comparison?
Maybe it is that more communication does not necessarily mean better communication.
After Bryant's death, a Washington Post reporter was put on administrative leave after she tweeted, without comment, a link to a story referencing 2003 rape allegations against Bryant hours after his death. She received death threats. Management reinstated her and said it had been wrong in publicly announcing disciplinary action against her.
But that supposed transgression pales next to that of a comic named Ari Shaffir, whose niche is apparently to be as cruel and offensive as possible.
Shaffir tweeted that Bryant died "too late," adding, "He got away with rape because all the Hollywood liberals who attack comedy enjoy rooting for the Lakers," referring to the Los Angeles Lakers, Bryant's team. Shaffir concluded with, "What a great day."
A talent agency and a comedy club reportedly dropped him, and he also received death threats. Still, his "joke" was featured in a New York Times story about the so-called "troll side" of comedy, and he will presumably continue to be a regular on Joe Rogan's popular podcast, given the host's forgiving criticism of Shaffir's comments about Bryant. So, who knows, maybe such behavior is good for his brand.
The Times troll story said in summary: "The shocking death of Bryant hit a bigger cultural nerve, revealing how dark humor has expanded and evolved in the era of social media." And later: "Its purpose is not to come up with a clever line that gets laughs, but to upset people, create discord and then laugh at that."
You can probably tell my preference was for the culture of the Clemente era.
And no, I am not kidding myself into believing that before social media no one said awful things when famous people died. JFK's murder was celebrated publicly in many parts of the South, a backlash against his focus on civil rights. But it went essentially unreported at the time.
Nor was comedy always sanitized. Comedian Lenny Bruce joked soon after Kennedy's death that Vaughn Meader, who gained fame for impersonating the president's voice, "was screwed," although Bruce used a more graphic word.
Still, the popular culture of the past seemed to have a greater sense of proportion, civility and basic decency. Cruelty and coarseness were the exception, not an explicit goal.
And if that thinking makes me old-fashioned or politically correct, I'm all right with that.

The double standard for old sexist Democrats

Texto completo: When it comes to respecting women, there's no such thing as a totally woke septuagenarian. Not on the 2020 presidential campaign trail.
Former vice president Joe Biden, 77, has been accused of hair-sniffing and other unwanted invasions of female space. Senator Bernie Sanders, 78, owns the “Bernie Bros" and their trail of Internet misogyny. And now comes former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg, also 78, who has faced multiple allegations of profane and sexist comments from women who worked for his company, some of whom filed lawsuits against him.
That's what you get when men of a certain age are considered electable — while doubts about electability undercut female candidates of any age. That's also what you get when you grant dispensation to men of a certain ideology — all in the name of ousting the sexist septuagenarian and alleged serial harasser who currently occupies the White House.
All they have to do is whisper “climate change" in our ear. Or, in Sanders' case, yell it.
President Trump's “grab them" attitude toward women was revealed in the crude “Access Hollywood" tape that emerged during the 2016 campaign. At least two dozen women have also accused Trump of sexual misconduct that runs the gamut from harassment and groping to rape. He denies all the allegations.
If the bar of acceptability for Democrats is not as bad as Trump — then, fine, this aging flock of male Democrats is not as bad as the 73-year-old Trump. But not as bad as Trump is not where Democrats should want to be. Not when the nominee will need women to win the presidency. Yet even after the #MeToo movement supposedly shattered the protected status of male entitlement, these guys can still get a pass — the same pass liberal women gave to Bill Clinton regarding his Trump-like sexual aggression back in the 1990s.
Biden's gropiness was largely forgiven, including by me, as the product of the touchy politics of a bygone era. But imagine the feminist outrage if Vice President Mike Pence buried his face in a random woman's hair, or massaged the shoulders of a female who was not his wife? Women who support Sanders also rushed to defend their man, despite the Bernie Bros who troll women who challenge the Vermont socialist. Let's face it, actress Susan Sarandon would not be making excuses for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's band of Internet bullies.
With Bloomberg, it's not just the ideology, it's the personal gazillions he pours into liberal causes. With his rise in the polls, the nondisclosure agreements— or NDAs — Bloomberg has entered into to enforce silence from his accusers are undergoing new scrutiny. But up until now, he was granted immunity from activists who would loudly rail against the same conduct from billionaires who call climate change a hoax. As The New York Times recently reported, Bloomberg remained the headline speaker at a 2018 fund-raising lunch hosted by Emily's List — even after he made disparaging comments about the #MeToo movement, and defended his friend Charlie Rose, the newscaster who lost his job over accusations of sexual harassment. Since the former NYC mayor had donated nearly $6 million to Emily's List, not to mention hundreds of millions of dollars to other causes dear to feminists, who was going to say no to him?
Senator Elizabeth Warren has called on Bloomberg to release the women who have accused him of sexist behavior from those NDAs. And UltraViolet, a national women's organization, wants the Democratic National Committee to block presidential candidates with active NDAs for sexual harassment and workplace abuse from the debate stage. So far, Bloomberg has refused to budge.
To Bloomberg's blatant sexism, you can add the racist “stop and frisk" policy (which he backed not only during his tenure as mayor but also long afterward, as revealed in a recently released audiotape) as well as his referencing of transgender people as “it" and “some guy wearing a dress."
If that passes the sniff test for men and women who want to beat Trump — to borrow from Pogo, we have met the enemy and she is us.

Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, faced a misconduct accusation by a Nevada ex-lawmaker in 2019 claiming the then-vice president inappropriately kissed her before a campaign event. Lucy Flores, the state's Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2014, said she was beside the stage awaiting her turn to address a rally when Biden put his hands on her shoulders from behind, then leaned in and smelled her hair.

Texto completo: Democratic outside groups are ramping up negative advertising against President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, in an effort to weaken him in a key battleground state he won by the slightest of margins in 2016 as their own presidential primary drags on.
On Tuesday, the liberal super PAC American Bridge 21st Century said it had launched a $10 million advertising campaign in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan targeted at working-class voters in rural areas, who were key to Trump's victory.
And starting next week, another Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA Action, will begin airing anti-Trump commercials on TV in the Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Altoona-Johnstown, and Scranton-Wilkes-Barre media markets. The group has reserved about $5.9 million worth of airtime through early July, according to the ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics.
Priorities USA - which has pledged to spend $150 million on the 2020 campaign before the party's convention in July - has also booked ads in other battleground states like Florida, Michigan, and Wisconsin, the New York Times reported last month.
Neither group has booked ads in the expensive Philadelphia market. Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg has bought the most airtime of any candidate or outside group in Pennsylvania, having spent almost $16 million on broadcast, cable, and radio commercials, according to Advertising Analytics. The Trump campaign has spent about $500,000 on the airwaves in the state.
Trump won Pennsylvania by about 0.7% of the vote in 2016.

Texto completo: America is a hot mess right now. Rather than feeling humbled as only the third impeached president in U.S. history, President Donald Trump - with the democracy-dies-in-broad-daylight help of his Roy Cohn-flavored attorney general, William Barr - has been emboldened to not just flout the established rule of law, and 233 years of constitutional norms, but to boast about his various high crimes and misdemeanors on Twitter. So naturally, I've been thinking about the Houston Astros.
If you're a political junkie but not a sports fan, the Astros are enmeshed in baseball's biggest scandal in a generation after revelations that in 2017, they used cameras to steal the opposing team's signs so their batters could know what pitch was coming, signaled by banging on a trash can or possibly (unconfirmed) more elaborate tools like buzzers. The cheating Astros rode this regimen all the way to the 2017 World Series championship, the first in franchise history. The baseball public is outraged. The baseball establishment? Meh.
The commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, has mostly been channeling his inner Susan Collins - suggesting that of course he's concerned, but that shame should prevent the Astros or any other team from behaving badly in the future. A formal punishment just feels pointless to Manfred. "The idea of an asterisk or asking for a piece of metal back seems like a futile act," the commissioner said - further enraging fans and non-Astros players by saying the World Series quest that is our annual Moby-Dick-level obsession is all just for "a piece of metal."
This is the state of play in America in February 2020. We are all Collins, and we are all Manfred, throwing our hands up to the sky in the face of flagrant wrongdoing and muttering to the world, "Whaddya gonna do?" It feels very much not coincidental that this is happening in baseball and American politics at the same time. It's the culture - win at all costs, and any rules or resistance is "futile."
The New York Times reported this week that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top House Democrats have agreed that the strategy between now and the November election will be to push an agenda around health care and jobs - and forget all that impeachment stuff.
This notion seems wrong on several levels. The 2018 Democrats were clever not to talk about Trump - and thus wave a red flag in the face of his most rabid supporters - because they didn't have to. The people on the ground who won those seats back for the Democrats - the army of volunteers who knocked on doors, made phone calls, preached to neighbors - were almost single-minded in their desire to hold the president to account. These voters were mad when Pelosi & Co. stalled on going after Trump in early 2019, then thrilled by the decision to impeach.
So to throw that all away now for a jobs agenda seems kind of ... lost. Here's what House Democrats can and should be doing:
Investigate, investigate, investigate. The lesson of impeachment was that while it may be politically impossible to punish wrongdoing in the current political climate, the House and its investigatory powers are currently the only way to put the truth before American voters.
House Democrats should subpoena and do whatever else it takes to get former national security adviser John Bolton to tell his story under oath - and not in the pages of a self-serving, money-motivated book. And don't be shy about other fronts - such as the Trump's family worrisome relationship with Deutsche Bank, revealed in an explosive new book.
Push an aggressive anti-corruption agenda. The nightmare of Trump's presidency screams out for a stronger package of bills that would shore up the rule of law, prevent future election cheating, make public information about candidates' taxes and their health, and tighten the ban on emoluments that already exists in the Constitution.
Don't surrender the powers to impeach and to censure. A House vote to formally censure Trump (which has only happened once, for Andrew Jackson) or to impeach Barr for their meddling in the judicial process might be politically foolhardy. That said, given how the last two weeks have gone, it's also possible to imagine high crimes and misdemeanors so egregious that the House would have little choice but to do something.
Pelosi and the House Democrats are in a difficult spot - but so is the future of our American Experiment in democracy. If right matters, as Rep. Adam Schiff said, then rising creatively to the occasion and not surrendering to a lawless administration has got to trump political calculations. Especially when good government would actually be good politics. A majority of voters desperately want the House to keep doing what it did in the fall of 2019 and hold Trump to account. We shouldn't have to go all Houston Astros and bang twice on a trash can to signal them to do it.

Texto completo: Jury ends 1st day of deliberations in Weinstein's rape trial
NEW YORK - Jurors in Harvey Weinstein's rape trial ended their first day of deliberations Tuesday with lots of questions and no verdict in the landmark #MeToo case that could put the once-powerful Hollywood producer behind bars for the rest of his life.
The panel of seven men and five women asked to see a floor plan of Weinstein's apartment and emails, including one he sent to a private spy agency in 2017 listing certain accusers he feared would come forward as "red flags."
The jury is weighing charges that Weinstein raped a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performed oral sex on another woman, TV and film production assistant Mimi Haleyi, in 2006.
In deciding the most serious charges against Weinstein, which allege that he is a sexual predator, jurors must also weigh actress Annabella Sciorra's account of a mid-1990s rape. While her allegation is too old to be charged on its own because to the statute of limitations in effect at the time, the law allows prosecutors to use her allegations as a basis for the predatory sexual assault counts.
The jury will resume deliberations today.
Jurors sent their first questions about 40 minutes into deliberations, asking for the legal definition of terms like consent and forcible compulsion, and seeking clarity on why Weinstein wasn't charged with other crimes stemming from Sciorra's allegation.
Prosecutors built their case around graphic, often-harrowing testimony from those women, along with three other accusers who were not part of the criminal case but were allowed to take the witness stand because they say Weinstein used the same tactics on them.
Weinstein's lawyers contend the acts were consensual. They focused on friendly, flirtatious emails some of the women sent to Weinstein and further meetings some of them had with him after the alleged assaults.
A torrent of allegations against Weinstein in October 2017 spawned the #MeToo movement. His trial is seen as a watershed moment for the cause, but Judge James Burke has cautioned jurors that it is "not a referendum on the #MeToo movement."
Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno sent a similar message in a Newsweek essay over the weekend, drawing complaints from a prosecutor who said she appeared to be trying to influence the jury.
Rotunno wrote that Weinstein's jurors "have an obligation to themselves and their country, to base their verdict solely on the facts, testimony and evidence presented to them in the courtroom," not critical news stories, unflattering courtroom sketches or other outside influences.
Confronted about the essay in court Tuesday, Rotunno said she was writing "about the jury system as a whole" and was not speaking to the jury in Weinstein's case.
Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said Rotunno's essay was "100% inappropriate." She asked Burke to instruct the jury to ignore the piece and revoke Weinstein's bail and send him to jail because, she argued, it couldn't have been done without his permission.
Burke denied the prosecution's request, but told Weinstein: "I would caution you about the tentacles of your public relations juggernaut."
Two weeks ago, Rotunno was criticized in court and on social media for an interview she gave to The New York Times podcast The Daily in which she blamed victims for getting sexually assaulted.
"That was taped a long time ago," Rotunno explained after Illuzzi questioned the timing of the interview, which aired Feb. 7.
The Times said later that the interview was recorded on Jan. 28 - five days after opening statements and the start of testimony.
Haleyi, a former "Project Runway" production assistant, testified that Weinstein pushed her onto a bed and sexually assaulted her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, "No, please don't do this, I don't want it."
The woman who says Weinstein raped her in 2013 sobbed in court as she described how she sent Weinstein flattering emails and kept seeing him after the alleged rape because "I wanted him to believe I wasn't a threat."
The Associated Press has a policy of not publishing the names of people who allege sexual assault without their consent. It is withholding the name of the rape accuser because it isn't clear whether she wishes to be identified publicly.

Texto completo: Saturday will mark the 40th anniversary of the Miracle On Ice, the United States' 4-3 victory over the Soviet Union in the 1980 Olympics at Lake Placid, N.Y. Feel free to celebrate, Minnesotans. You need not be provincial to lay claim to the greatest sporting event of our lifetimes.
"Nine guys on the team were Gophers," Wayne Coffey said. "Twelve of the 20 players on the team were from Minnesota, and the coach was a working-class guy from east St. Paul, and his support staff was just about all Minnesotans. At its core, it is such a Minnesota story."
Coffey has authored five New York Times bestsellers. That game, and the subsequent victory over Finland that gave the United States the gold medal, have been celebrated annually and extensively for 40 years, most famously in the movie "Miracle."
If you're interested in nuance and detail, I'm not sure you'll find as thorough a retelling of the story anywhere other than in Coffey's "The Boys of Winter." He traveled Russia and traveled throughout Minnesota, gathering stories about working-class parents who would build backyard rinks or drive to the lake at night and practice in the glow of car lights.
He was in Minnesota, scheduled to speak with Herb Brooks, the coach and architect of the team, the night that Brooks was killed in a car accident near Forest Lake. The book opens with scenes from Brooks' funeral in the Cathedral of St. Paul, with his former players forming a canopy of hockey sticks over his casket, and includes scenes from the dismal housing in the Olympic Village.
Coffey provides vivid reminders that this was a unique place and time. The Games were held in a remote village of 2,800. Housing was sparse and Spartan, even for the most famous Olympians. "It's this tiny, little Adirondack village, 30 miles from the nearest highway," Coffey said. "The idea that they held the Olympics there is mind-blowing.''
The U.S.-Soviet Union game was broadcast on tape-delay. The U.S. team of college kids was facing what might have been the greatest hockey team ever assembled, one that beat them 10-3 weeks earlier at Madison Square Garden. A year before, the Soviets had beaten the NHL all-stars 6-0.
"People who know more about hockey than I do consider that Russian team the greatest collection of hockey talent, ever," Coffey said. "Another thing people forget about that game is that the Russians outshot the U.S., 39-16. If Jim Craig doesn't play out of his mind, we're not even talking about this right now.
"It was men versus boys in this last Olympics to be held in a little village, the last time a game of that magnitude will ever be shown in tape-delay," Coffey said.
Coffey weaves intricate game details with profiles of players, many of whom he tracked down in remote Minnesota locations. He notes that backup goalie Steve Janaszak of White Bear Lake was the most valuable player of the 1979 NCAA championship tournament for Brooks when the Gophers won the national title but became the only Olympian not to participate at the Lake Placid Games.
Brooks was maniacal and Machiavellian. He appears to have thrown the Madison Square Garden game to the Soviets to make them overconfident -- and it worked.
Brooks was bumped off the 1960 Olympic team days before the Games began. U.S. coach Jack Riley wanted 1956 Olympic star Bill Cleary to join the team. Bill insisted that he and his brother, Bob, were a package.
The team pasted Bob Cleary's face over Brooks' in the team picture, and the U.S. went on to win the gold. Brooks watched at home in St. Paul with his father, who, at the conclusion of the tournament, turned to Herb and said, "Well, I guess the coach cut the right guy."
"Sad to say, but the most indelible memories we all have are almost always horrible," Coffey said. "I can tell you where I was standing when JFK was assassinated, and Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy. This was an event that was incredibly positive that everyone remembers where they were and who they were with.
"We learn in sportswriting to never say never. Lou Gehrig's record would never be broken, until it was. But this will never happen again. This can't ever happen again. And it was Herb Brooks who made it possible."
