Resumen: After falling apart in a 5-1 loss to Dartmouth on Dec. 10, the Wildcats opened the second half of the season on a better note against a Hockey East opponent, although the game does not count in conference standings. With 15 Hockey East matchups ahead of them, the Wildcats (9-7-2, 5-1-1 in conference) will try to at least maintain their position, tied for third place in the standings, and a win Friday night points them in the right direction. After Kelleher put the Wildcats back in front, freshman forward Justin Fregona scored his first career goal to give UNH a two-goal lead.

MANCHESTER – Jason Salvaggio would rather stay out of the spotlight, but it was unavoidable for the junior forward Friday night.
The Wildcats scored six goals and Salvaggio had his fingerprints on four of them to help UNH to a 6-4 win over border rival Maine at SNHU Arena in Manchester.
“It's definitely a good way to start the second half of the year,” Salvaggio said.
After falling apart in a 5-1 loss to Dartmouth on Dec. 10, the Wildcats opened the second half of the season on a better note against a Hockey East opponent, although the game does not count in conference standings.
With 15 Hockey East matchups ahead of them, the Wildcats (9-7-2, 5-1-1 in conference) will try to at least maintain their position, tied for third place in the standings, and a win Friday night points them in the right direction.
The first line set the pace with four goals produced by Salvaggio, Tyler Kelleher and Michael McNicholas (two assists). UNH Coach Dick Umile can't ask for much more from a line of forwards in one night.
“We had a good first line last year and we've got another now with McNicholas and Salvaggio with Kelleher,” Umile said. “I'm very pleased with them. They're a threat when they're on the ice.”
Salvaggio opened the scoring for the Wildcats just 28 seconds into the game on a two-on-one chance with McNicholas. Salvaggio later scored his second goal of the night, his 11th of the year, with 5:58 on the clock in the third period to go ahead 5-3.
“We all jell pretty good. We've got some good chemistry going so we're going to try to keep it going forward,” Salvaggio said. “When we got that goal we could breathe a little bit. It was a little easier on the bench.”
Before time expired, he threw a pass out to Kelleher who scored on an empty net for UNH's sixth goal.
Kelleher also came out of the game with four points, pushing his season total up to 35 through 18 games. The senior forward gave UNH a 3-2 lead in the second period. Carrying the puck over the blue line, Kelleher beat two defensemen and snapped a shot over Maine netminder Rob McGovern's shoulder on the short side.
Kelleher's goal was the last shot McGovern would face as Maine Coach Red Gendron replaced him with Matt Morris.
Maine's Ryan Smith scored less than a minute after Salvaggio to even the score, but Shane Eiserman's shorthanded goal 9:02 into the game gave UNH a 2-1 lead heading into the first intermission. Salvaggio went to the penalty box on a slashing call and Maine won the ensuing faceoff, but Eiserman poked the puck into the neutral zone and got behind the Maine defense for a breakaway. He finished beating McGovern over his blocker-side shoulder.
But Maine evened the score again, this time 44 seconds into the second period on defenseman Eric Schurhamer's power play goal.
After Kelleher put the Wildcats back in front, freshman forward Justin Fregona scored his first career goal to give UNH a two-goal lead. Fregona capitalized on his opportunity on the ice in place of Marcus Vela, who Umile said is fighting an illness.
Fregona, skating with sophomores Ara Nazarian and Chris Miller, helped force a turnover as Maine tried to break out of UNH's end. Fregona picked up the loose puck, turned toward the net and scored, extending the Wildcats' lead to 4-2.
Schurhamer scored his second goal in the closing minute of the second period, cutting UNH's lead down to one. It took a bit longer in the third, but Salvaggio finally netted his second goal of the night with 5:58 on the clock to re-establish a two-goal lead for the Wildcats.
Kelleher's empty netter didn't go unanswered. Patrick Holway scored his third goal of the year for the Black Bears, but with 10 seconds on the clock there was little fanfare for the freshman forward from Massachusetts.
Maine held the edge in shots through 60 minutes, 37-25, but UNH goaltender Danny Tirone turned 33 of those shots away.
“He's aggressive and he's playing with confidence,” Umile said. “He came out of the net, he knew where he was, he challenged the shooter and he made terrific saves.”
“We had a lot of great chances,” Gendron said postgame. “The goalie for UNH played superbly. I think that's the truth. … If you came and you watched the game and you didn't know what the score was, you would've thought Maine won the game.”
The Wildcats are back on the ice Friday to host No. 7 UMass Lowell.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage is set to release his fourth and final two-year budget proposal on Friday, giving him one last chance to reshape Maine government before his tenure ends in early 2019.
A new biennial budget will have to be in place by July 1, and it will guide state spending through June 2019, when Maine will have a new governor.
Representatives for LePage and his finance department didn't respond to questions about the budget, but the Republican governor has dropped hints in radio interviews and public appearances during the past few months, giving us a rough idea of what to expect come Friday.
Whatever he proposes is just a starting point, and Maine's last two budgets -- after being drastically altered by the Legislature's budget committee -- passed over LePage vetoes in a time of divided government in Augusta that will continue in 2017, with Republicans and Democrats holding narrow majorities in the Senate and House, respectively.
LePage's upcoming spending plan is likely to be a variation on the themes that have marked his six years in the Blaine House, chiefly lower taxes and smaller government. Many unanswered questions remain, and the Republican governor said Thursday that he's still not certain what shape his proposed budget would take.
"I'm very, very concerned about what the budget's going to look like," he told WGAN. "I have no idea at this point, and it's due, what, the 6th of January?"
The governor has said he'll continue his crusade to lower Maine's income tax without increasing the sales tax, hinting at "major cuts."
LePage told Lewiston-area business leaders in October that he'll propose a budget that cuts Maine's income tax -- which now has a top rate of 7.95 percent -- to 4 percent. In part, that change is designed to offset a 3 percent surcharge on income over $200,000 passed by Maine voters in November.
That rate would be lower than those he proposed in an ambitious budget document in 2015. But that proposal would have increased sales taxes and broadened the sales tax base to compensate for the lower income tax rate. Many legislative Republicans opposed the sales tax changes and worked with Democrats to craft a compromise budget over the governor's veto.
LePage has ruled out raising sales taxes this time because of past opposition. In a December interview with WVOM, he said without new sales tax revenue, "major cuts" are necessary to meet the statutory obligation to balance the budget.
A leaked memo indicated that LePage wanted deep cuts to the state workforce. While he recently said he wants to shrink government, he also said he wants a flat budget.
One possible avenue for a major cut came in July, when the Portland Press Herald published a leaked memo from LePage's deputy chief of staff that said he wanted to cut the state's workforce by 2,300 people -- or more than 19 percent.
LePage disputed media reports on that issue, but nothing he said contradicted their accuracy, although the administration later signaled that cuts wouldn't be wholesale.
Adrienne Bennett, the governor's spokeswoman, said that LePage would be "assessing and evaluating the value" of 2,400 limited-period state employee positions -- those with an effective end date often because they're federally funded.
But there have been mixed messages, with LePage telling WGAN on Thursday he was working that day to finalize spending cuts and said "we're going to shrink government best I can."
The governor also took a swipe at some branches of state government, saying he wants to submit a flat total budget but "it's like talking to a wall" with "absolutely unreasonable" demands from some agencies. LePage noted two specific requests from the University of Maine System and his own Maine Office of Information Technology.
The university system requested a 12 percent funding increase in October, and the governor said the IT office wants "like a $50 million" increase. A office spokesman didn't respond to a question about that, but the office's current annual budget is less than $57 million.
Even if the state workforce isn't cut in a major way, programs could be. For example, LePage may have an easier time making cuts to state welfare programs with Republican President-elect Donald Trump set to take office on Jan. 20.
For context, the compromise budget that lawmakers passed over LePage's objections in 2015 set state spending at about $6.7 billion.
LePage also has said that he won't include money to implement marijuana legalization and fund school superintendents.
The governor also will use his budget proposal to further a host of smaller policy goals, which will likely punt funding for the new recreational marijuana program approved by Maine voters in November and K-12 superintendents to the Legislature.
LePage said in December that he won't include money for his administration to oversee the marijuana market, which was projected at $2.5 million in 2018 by the Legislature's fiscal office. Saying he would need at least $3 million to create a retail sales oversight infrastructure for recreational marijuana, LePage said that he'll "let the Legislature deal with" a funding mechanism for legalization.
In October, LePage said that he won't include money for school superintendents. He has often complained that Maine has too many and that more money should be spent in classrooms.
However, there isn't a vast amount to be saved here. Out of the nearly $2.3 billion spent on Maine schools in the 2014-15 school year, under 3 percent -- or less than $67 million -- was spent on system administration.
Administrators and municipalities also will criticize it as a cost shift to cities and towns. That's nothing new. LePage proposed suspending state aid to cities and towns in 2013 and again in 2015. The Legislature restored it, but only after a slog that put the issue under the spotlight.
By most accounts, the state's revenue situation is better now than it was when LePage unveiled his previous three budget proposals. But after voters in November passed the income tax surtax and raised the minimum wage, he has argued that those citizen initiatives will cause grave harm to Maine's economy and that the next state budget must include measures that counteract what he perceives to be the widespread negative repercussions those votes will have.
In addition to framing Maine's policy dialogue between now and June, the budget document LePage releases Friday will add a key new chapter to what will become his legacy.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Since 2014, the city has approved construction of more than 1,500 new homes, but the vast majority are too small to house families, which Portland needs in order to grow, city leaders say.
Over the past two decades, the cost of city services has risen while the number of taxpayers has remained relatively flat. The best way to span the resulting revenue gap is to add more people, according to city leaders, who want to boost Portland's population from about 67,000 to 72,000 by 2027.
These new Portlanders will need homes and, spurred by high rents and low vacancies, developers are building lots of them. But they have too often been high-end, low-occupancy units that don't attract the families who would drive sustained population growth and build vibrant neighborhoods, said Planning and Urban Development Director Jeff Levine.
"We need to focus more on providing family housing that people actually spend time in, as opposed to these pied-a-terres that people come to for the weekend," said Levine. "Until a couple of years ago, a lot of the focus was on housing that attracted empty nesters."
Developers have broken ground on more than 60 percent of the new housing approved over the last three years. This surge in supply may eventually offer some relief to the low- and middle-income Portlanders who have struggled to keep their heads above the tide of rising rents. And yet, because of their location and size, these new homes are unlikely to heat up the tepid population growth in Maine's largest city and economic hub.
Since 2014, 97 percent of the approved housing developments have had two or fewer bedrooms, according to city data, and 77 percent were built on the peninsula. Only 45 of the 694 units under construction since 2013 had three or more bedrooms -- although the city data exclude free-standing houses.
This pattern fits with the national trend of young adults and aging baby boomers flocking back to cities, according to Patrick Venne, a Portland development consultant and former Berwick city manager.
"The people who want to be in the city only need two bedrooms," said Venne.
Portland has only gained 2,600 people over the last 15 years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And if it were not for thousands of immigrants who moved here, the city would likely have had a net population loss over that period.
Parents, who might be attracted by the culture and energy of cities, are often still looking for the good schools and space of the suburbs. They largely don't want to live in the urban core, said Venne. This dynamic, coupled with the high rents, puts Portland at risk of being hollowed out and giving way to a sprawl of commuter suburbs, according to a recent report on the city's growth authored by local experts.
Developing Portland neighborhoods outside the urban core, such as Deering Center and Morrill's Corner, so that they blend the qualities of the city and suburbs, is the best way to attract families to the city, according to the report.
The city is tinkering with how to channel development money toward building the right size homes in the right areas.
The zoning code -- which developers frequently grumble about and Levine described as an archaeological dig of regulations piled upon regulations going back to at least the 1970s -- may get major changes over the next two years. And the planning department is considering a system that would reward developers who construct multi-bedroom units by allowing them to add extra units onto their buildings.
Venne said development markets in larger American cities have already shifted to provide families with neighborhoods, and that developers here will eventually respond to the trend.
"It's just a scale thing," he said.

AUGUSTA -- Central Maine Power Co. said Friday it could take days to restore power to all its customers after a snowstorm swept across the state and dumped more than a foot of snow on many places in central Maine, cutting power to about one-third of CMP customers in Kennebec County.
More than 28,000 CMP customers were still without power at 9:10 p.m. Friday, including 11,346 in Kennebec County.
Downed power lines also were reported Friday morning around central Maine when 97,000 Mainers woke up with no power, including nearly 23,000 in Kennebec County.
That number dropped throughout the day as crews worked around the state.
According to a news release on CMP's website, restoration could take "several days" because of poor travel conditions and deep snow piled along roadsides.
More than 350 local line crews, contractors and tree crews, including some from other states and Canada, were working on restoring power Friday, the release said.
Gail Rice, a spokeswoman for CMP, said Friday morning the power utility will update its website with estimated restoration times as they become available.
"Initial reports from the field indicate travel conditions are difficult, and high winds in northern parts of our service area could cause additional outages and hinder repair progress," Rice said in the news release.
A drone flown by Randolph-based company Coutts, which provides maintenance services to utilities in the Northeast, spotted a fallen tree stuck on a transmission line near Skowhegan around 10 a.m., according to a CMP tweet. The technology saved the company hours that would have been spent patrolling the area, the company said.
Around Kennebec County, snowfall from the storm ranged from 10 inches in Windsor to 21 inches in Fayette by Friday morning. Winthrop had 16.5 inches, Hallowell had 14 inches, Winslow had 12 inches and Waterville had 11 inches, according to the National Weather Service.
The weather also prompted numerous closures and delays around central Maine. Gov. Paul LePage announced that state offices would not open until 9 a.m., while Augusta and Gardiner delayed opening their city halls until 10 a.m. Augusta also suspended its trash collection and closed the Hatch Hill Solid Waste Disposal Facility on Friday as a result of the snowfall, and Gardiner delayed opening its public library until 10 a.m.
"I urge all of you to drive safely as you commute to your destination," LePage said in a news release. "Stopping on snow or ice without skidding requires extra time and distance. Drive slowly so you can adjust to changing road conditions. Please remember to keep a safe distance behind other vehicles and give plow trucks plenty of room to operate."
The Waterville Police Department had handled 10 storm-related car accidents by 2 p.m., Deputy Chief Bill Bonney said. There were also some reports of downed wires and tree limbs, but Bonney hadn't seen any that caused serious damage yet.
In Oakland, a tree limb fell on Fairfield Street, but emergency services have seen little damage otherwise. In Smithfield, Fire Chief John Easler said around 10:45 a.m. that a power line fell on East Pond Road. On Thursday, after the storm began, a driver lost control on the bridge on Rome Road around 2:50 p.m. and the driver's car flipped onto its top, Easler said. The single occupant was not hurt in the crash.
In Sidney, a tree fell on a house on Quaker Road just hours after it was sold to a young couple.
Greater snowfall totals were recorded in more inland counties. In Somerset County, 16 to 24 inches of snow were reported in Norridgewock, Skowhegan, Solon and North Anson. The Fairfield Police Department got seven reports of wires or tree branches down on Main Street, Center Road, Middle Road and other locations.
Despite the heavy snowfall, the Somerset County Sheriff's Office said there were no accidents or severe damage to report as of 10:40 a.m.
In Franklin County, 19 to 21 inches of snow was reported in Chesterville, New Sharon, Wilton and Jay. The sheriff's office had no severe accidents or damages to report as of 10 a.m.
Sugarloaf ski resort in Carrabassett Valley reported receiving 2 feet at its base and as much as 30 inches at higher elevations.

Texto completo:   In Manchester: Salvaggio, Kelleher have big nights.
MANCHESTER Jason Salvaggio and Tyler Kelleher both put together four-point performances to help the University of New Hampshire capture a 6-4 non-league victory over Maine before 4,460 fans Friday night at SNHU Arena.
The victory capped a three-game regular-season sweep of the Black Bears for UNH (9-7-2). The Wildcats also swept the teams' home-and-home Hockey East series Dec. 2-3.
Salvaggio tallied the game's first goal 28 seconds into the contest and scored again with 5:58 remaining to build a 5-3 Wildcats lead. He also assisted on both of Kelleher's tallies.
Kelleher built a 3-2 UNH lead 5:58 into the second period and capped UNH's scoring with an empty-netter off a feed from Salvaggio with 1:07 remaining. Kelleher also assisted on both of Salvaggio's tallies.
"We had a good first line last year and we've got another one this year with (Michael) McNicholas and Salvaggio with Kelleher," UNH coach Dick Umile said. "(I'm) very pleased with them. They're a threat when they're on the ice."
UNH mustered just six shots on goal in the second period but two found the back of the net to give the Wildcats a 4-3 lead going into the third.
Kelleher broke a 2-2 deadlock 5:58 into the second period when he beat Maine netminder Rob McGovern glove side. The senior right wing skated into the Maine zone and across the ice toward the right circle with Maine defenseman Rob Michel shadowing him. Kelleher shot around Michel from the right circle and bested McGovern.
Matt Morris (11 saves) replaced McGovern (eight saves) in the Maine cage following Kelleher's goal.
UNH freshman Justin Fregona's first career goal gave the Wildcats a 4-2 advantage with 4:30 left in the second period.
Maine senior Eric Schurhamer scored two power-play goals in the second period. His first came 44 seconds into the frame to tie the game at 2-2. Schurhamer's second tally on the advantage cut UNH's lead to 4-3 with 51.6 seconds left in the frame.
Maine freshman Patrick Holway capped the game's scoring with 9.7 seconds remaining.
The Black Bears (7-10-3) outshot UNH 37-25 and spent a great deal of time in the offensive zone but the Wildcats made the most of their rushes and shots.
"(If) you came and you watched the game and you didn't know what the score was, you would have thought Maine won the game," Black Bears coach Red Gendron said. "But that's not what happened."
Salvaggio's first goal and a shorthanded tally by Shane Eiserman gave the Wildcats a 2-1 advantage after the opening period. Eiserman stole the puck from Schurhamer in the UNH zone, skated up ice on a breakaway and flipped the puck over McGovern's right shoulder 9:02 into the first to break a 1-1 tie.
Ryan Smith put the Black Bears on the board and knotted the score at 1-1 at the 1:16 mark of the first period.
Danny Tirone made 33 saves for the Wildcats. Maine scored on two of its four power plays despite logging just three shots on the man advantage. UNH finished with three shots on goal over its three power plays.
"I think if you're attempting to be objective, you'd say, 'Jeez, Maine was pretty good tonight but not good enough,'" Gendron said. "And (congratulations) go to UNH."

Texto completo: ‘Turbocharged’ storm clobbers New England
PORTLAND, Maine - The most powerful nor’easter in nearly two years brought heavy snow, powerful winds and even thunder and lightning to northern New England, leaving tens of thousands of people in the dark Friday and burying some towns under 2 feet of snow.
More than 100,000 homes and businesses in Maine were without electricity at the storm’s peak, and residents were warned that it could take days to restore service. The National Weather Service received reports of snow falling at up to 6 inches per hour.
Hundreds of cars slid off roads from the beginning of the storm on Thursday through Friday morning, when the sun appeared. In Vermont, a 69-year-old man was killed in Cornwall when his car went off the road in slippery conditions Thursday and crashed into a tree, state police said.
Southern and western Maine turned out to be in the storm’s bull’s-eye, but the storm played a game of hopscotch, pummeling some communities with snow while leaving others just miles away drenched in rain.
U.S. deportations rise 2 percent in 2016
WASHINGTON - The Obama administration has deported 240,255 immigrants over the past 12 months, a 2 percent increase over 2015 bit a sharp decrease from 2014.
Commenting on the statistics released Friday, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said his department remains focused on finding and deporting immigrants who pose a national security or public safety threat, those who have serious criminal records, and those who recently crossed the Mexican border.
Of those deported, 58 percent had criminal convictions. This was little changed from the 59 percent recorded last year and 56 percent in 2014.
Man facing charges had 19 expulsions
WICHITA, Kan. - A Mexican man accused of raping a 13-year-old girl on a Greyhound bus that traveled through Kansas had been deported 10 times and voluntarily removed from the United States another nine times since 2003, records obtained by The Associated Press show.
Three U.S. Republican senators - including Kansas’ Jerry Moran and Pat Roberts - demanded this month that the Department of Homeland Security provide immigration records for 38-year-old Tomas Martinez-Maldonado. He is charged with a felony in the alleged Sept. 27 attack aboard a bus in Geary County, where he is being held.
Suspect faces chargesin ax-wielding robbery
TRENTON, N.J. - A police officer was bitten by a man who used an ax to smash a gas station cash register while demanding lottery tickets, authorities said Friday.
Assistant Mercer County Prosecutor John Boyle said 39-year-old Anthony Hunter, of Trenton, rushed at and bit the officer on the right hand after police tried to arrest him at a Lukoil station in Ewing.
Prosecutors say Hunter smashed the store’s cash register with an ax Monday and demanded that workers fill a bag with scratch-off lottery tickets before he ran from the station. He has been charged with two counts of robbery.

Texto completo:   BELFAST, Maine -- Heightened demand for affordable places to live, sluggish housing development and an increase in recent years of seasonal and short-term rentals have combined to create to an apartment crunch along much of the Maine coast.
Recognizing the shortage, midcoast communities are looking for ways to convince more property owners and developers to bring new apartments and ease the strain.
"We're all in the same boat," Audra Caler-Bell, Rockland's community development director and acting city manager, said. "There's an increasing shortage of affordable housing, and that extends into workforce housing. We're talking about people who are gainfully employed -- teachers, shipyard workers -- who are struggling to find and afford a decent place to live."
When an apartment comes up for rent in the $600 to $900 range -- what generally is considered an "affordable" rate -- the response is frenzied. Landlords field dozens of calls, set up multiple walkthroughs and take their pick of tenant, often in the span of just a few days.
Those who miss out either get in line for the next one or settle for a less-than-ideal living situation. It's a game that's becoming all too familiar to current and hopeful renters in Belfast, Rockport, Camden, Rockland and elsewhere along the coast.
Kate Pendleton has settled into her new apartment, a nicely renovated one-bedroom unit in Belfast built above a converted two-bay garage next to her landlord's home. It was a fight to get it but at $725 per month, heat included, it was a steal compared to others she'd seen.
"This was the first time I'd ever looked for a place in town -- normally I'm out in the boonies," the 21-year-old said during an interview at her apartment, a Charlie Brown-style Christmas tree perched in a nearby corner.
When her lease ended on her former apartment in Jackson, Pendleton decided she wanted to move closer to Belfast, where she works at the athenahealth call center -- the city's largest employer. After more than a month of searching, she ran out of time and had to move home temporarily with her mother, resulting in a 45-minute commute.
She said she wasn't confident her wages -- about $15 per hour -- would allow her to comfortably afford the rents she was seeing during her lengthy apartment search. Rent ranged from $800 to over $1,000, and heating costs often weren't included. Apartments that were affordable were in rough shape, she said.
Her search continued for two more months, until she heard a co-worker was eyeing a place a few miles from downtown. More than a dozen others had lined up to look at it. Pendleton got together a stack of papers including references, a resume, financial information, set up a meeting with the landlord and swept in to snatch the place up.
"I was sure that if I didn't grab this one, another nice, affordable place might not come up for months," Pendleton said, adding that she's still on good terms with her co-worker. "The competitiveness of trying to find an apartment is one of the most stressful factors. It's like a battle of the fittest."
Pendleton isn't alone in her struggles. Other friends of hers are in the midst of monthslong searches for places in the midcoast. Some are living with relatives while others have moved into apartments they can't afford long term or run-down places with lower rents.
Jason Doppelt, 31, first moved to Maine from Kansas City there years ago. Back home, he rented a small studio apartment near the heart of the city for just $450 per month, complete with air conditioning and onsite laundry. He was easily able to afford it with wages he earned as a cook.
Three summers ago, he visited Maine in his travel trailer and fell in love, but he struggled to find year-round work as a chef and struggled even harder to find a place that cost roughly the same as what he had in Kansas City.
"I thought I could find something comparable," he said. "Well, it didn't work out that way."
After living in his travel trailer for a summer, he went back to Missouri for the winter with his "tail tucked between his legs." The next summer, he returned, living in a van during the warmest stretch of the year so he could afford rent at a friend's cabin for the winter.
"Just coming up with first and last month's rent for some of these places is incredibly tough, let alone keeping up with monthly rent and heat bills," Doppelt said.
This year, he's more settled, living in the basement of a house that he rents along with three friends, though he'd rather have his own place. But by settling for a basement room and living with roommates, he's able to have a roof over his head year-round for just $300 per month.
When he first moved to Maine, he earned minimum wage in a kitchen job, bringing in about $250 per week. He made a little more cooking on schooners in the summer. Now, as a mechanic, he's bringing in $450 per week. He says the wages in area just aren't enough to support the types of rental prices he saw.
"I really like Maine, and I really want to stay here," he said. "I want the midcoast to be my home, and I just have to find a way to make it work."
In demand
Caler-Bell said this is a problem more municipal leaders along the midcoast are recognizing and starting to grapple with.
Caler-Bell said Rockland started looking at the issue after several local employers, notably Fisher Engineering, reported that employees were struggling to find decent places to rent in the area so they could start work. Some resorted to living out of their cars or commuting long distances, Caler-Bell said. Fisher officials declined to comment for this story.
"Pickings are slim. You're paying a premium sometimes for housing that might not meet your needs," Caler-Bell said.
Apartment unit prices in Waldo and Knox counties have long outpaced the earnings of many people who call the area home, according to annual reports from the Maine Housing Authority.
In Belfast, the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment in 2015 (the most recent report available) was $831 including utilities, according to Maine Housing. To afford that rent comfortably, a person should be making about $33,232, but the median income in Belfast is $23,689.
In Rockland, the average rent is higher -- $1,007 per month -- which a renter would need to earn $40,260 per year to afford, according to the housing agency. The median income among Rockland renters, however, is just over $30,000. Camden's average two-bedroom rental runs around $925 per month. The median renter earns about $35,700, which is closer to the $37,000 income recommended to afford that rent.
Midcoast communities have become more of a draw in recent years, with a revival of downtowns and new industries popping up across Belfast, Rockland and Camden.
"We're seeing an influx of new people, and we want more of these folks to be able to call Belfast home," Wayne Marshall, Belfast's city planner, said. Unfortunately, many are having to settle outside town or in rental situations that are less than ideal.
Marshall has been working for the city for 18 years, but in all that time he said he hasn't seen a single market-rate, multifamily housing structure go up. Years ago, MBNA built a 46-unit housing complex off Crocker Road so its employees would have places to live. After that center closed about a decade ago, the apartments were sold and converted into condominiums.
Why the shortage?
Bennett Bricker, a Camden-based real estate broker, believes a big contributor is the fact that people in their 20s and 30s can't afford to buy homes like they used to. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, many lenders wouldn't giving out mortgages unless the person had 20 percent down available before signing on to a mortgage.
"Many younger professionals don't have $6,000 to $8,000 in the bank to make that first payment on a house anymore," Bricker said.
In addition, some older homeowners are downsizing, selling their homes in favor of renting smaller properties.
"That creates much more demand than we've ever had," Bricker said, and contributes to a frantic rental market, in which hopeful renters are climbing over one another to secure apartments.
It also stems from the number of people who only live in these towns for part of the year. If you're looking to live in Belfast, for example, there are dozens of properties ranging from downtown lofts to entire furnished homes up for rent during winter months while the owners are away. But come spring, you have to search for another place, and competition among prospective renters gets intense.
Some property owners are repurposing former apartment units, rooms and rental homes, taking them off year-round listings and advertising them as weekly summer rentals, often using internet-based services such as Airbnb.
This causes concern for town officials, who worry that if the practices continue, some parts of town could become largely abandoned for chunks of the year.
"We don't want Belfast to go dark," Marshall said. "It's critical that Belfast remains what it always has been -- a community that has a wide range of people living and working here."
Bricker said municipal policies also have played a role. Local zoning ordinances setting minimum lot sizes for multiunit housing has been a significant impediment to potential apartment developments in communities across the state, Bricker argued.
If an apartment developer can't fit enough units on a lot to make the project economically feasible, they're not going to move forward with a construction or redevelopment effort, he said.
"Some towns are starting to realize this is holding things back and making the rental situation more difficult," Bricker said.
Encouraging expansion
Rockland has been focusing on finding solutions to the shortage. The city council is considering a series of sweeping zoning ordinance changes to encourage people to develop more units close to town.
The overhaul would reduce minimum lot size requirements, allow small secondary units (such as an above-garage apartment or guest house) on lots and reduce setbacks and road frontage requirements.
However, some in the community have said the changes would lead to the construction of small out-buildings between homes, causing some neighborhoods to become congested and changing the feel and aesthetics of others. Others worry that these new units will only lead to more short-term rentals that might not be made available to hopeful residents.
Caler-Bell said the city has been trying to tailor existing programs to help people with housing projects, making about $25,000 available for renovation and weatherization efforts through its housing rehabilitation assistance program. Traditionally this is targeted toward multifamily housing, but the city is seeking potential first-time homebuyers who want to purchase and fix up a place.
In Belfast, Marshall and the city's planning board are vetting possible solutions as well and plan on bringing a detailed proposal to the city council in coming months. Among the changes they're considering is allowing property owners in certain parts of the city to convert existing single-family homes or duplexes into multifamily units. Marshall said the city hopes to continue to find ways to encourage new market-rate housing construction.
A few years ago, Belfast changed its zoning ordinances to allow people to build apartments in detached structures, such as above-garage apartments. Around the same time, the city decreased the minimum lot size required to have a duplex.
Caler-Bell said communities should start taking a broader, regional look at the issue across the midcoast. She said the Midcoast Economic Development District, a group of which she is a member, recently began discussing the rental shortage as a concern and could begin looking at fixes. For example, it could be easier for a regional group such as this to secure the necessary funding to launch residential development projects that would put a dent in the problem.
Still, she said, it's vital that towns continue to find ways to encourage private citizens to develop apartments on their own.
"Otherwise, our communities could fall victim to their own growth," Caler-Bell said.

Texto completo:   WESTBROOK, Maine -- Yassin Saker didn't meet his youngest daughter until her first birthday. They were outside a terminal at Boston's Logan Airport on Nov. 1 and the little girl took in her father with a long, uncertain gaze, Saker recalled.
"I knew she didn't know me," he said.
The child was born in Syria while her father was slicing deli meat at a Maine supermarket to raise money to get his family away from the brutal civil war that had overrun their home in Damascus.
Their first meeting marked the end of a years-long struggle to escape the war that destroyed their home and put an ocean between Saker and his family -- a plight he first shared with the Bangor Daily News in December 2015.
Saker, 60, emigrated to the United States from Syria in 1978. A gifted student, he came to study medicine in New Hampshire, but when the cost of medical school overwhelmed his family, he changed tracks and transferred to University of Maine at Presque Isle, where he'd won a scholarship.
By the time he graduated with a math degree in 1986, Saker had fallen in love with Maine, he said. Nine years later, he became an American citizen. He eventually got a job teaching math at Portland Arts and Technology High School. During summer breaks, Saker would return to Syria to visit his family. That's when he fell in love again, this time with a woman: Fadia al Shibbli.
They were married in 2003 and planned to return to Maine together. But things went awry two years later when Saker's father fell ill. Saker moved back to the Damascus suburbs to care for his parents. He and his wife had their first daughter, Raneem, in 2006, and son Mustafa three years later. Still planning to eventually return to Portland, Saker made sure that each of his children obtained the documents securing their American citizenship. But things went wrong again in 2012, while al Shibbli, now 38, was pregnant with their third child.
"Then the bad times came," Saker recalled.
As fighting between the forces of Syrian President Bashar al Assad and anti-government rebels mounted, bombs began falling in the Damascus suburbs. Like millions of other Syrians, the Saker family fled.
They sought safety in the government-held core of Damascus, but within a couple years, they were struggling to pay rent in the two-bedroom apartment that was shared with a dozen other people. The crush of refugees into the city had spiked rents by more than 500 percent and there was little work to be found, Saker said.
"We had no hope, no hope at all," he recalled. "When we moved we lost everything."
The family began looking for ways to return to the United States. As citizens, that would have been possible for Saker and his children alone. But al Shibbli needed a guarantee from an American sponsor who could provide financial support, and Saker did not have enough money.
By March 2015, they had already sold al Shibbli's jewelry for rent money, but Saker didn't want to leave his wife and children in a war zone. It was al Shibbli who eventually convinced him to return to the United States in the hope of finding work and bringing his family along after, the couple recalled.
Through begging and borrowing Saker rounded up the money to buy a plane ticket, he said. But just before he left, al Shibbli brought him news they weren't expecting: She was pregnant.
"We were not planning for it," said Saker. "Life was so difficult, and we had no money and, you know -- war time."
Jena was born on Nov. 1, 2015, after her father left. Al Shibbli recalled the world that her youngest daughter arrived into as terrifying. Outside Damascus, fighting between the government, the rebels, Islamic State and various militias was ferocious. Inside the city there were kidnappings, and government forces would raid people's homes looking for rebels or those suspected of supporting them, she said, speaking through her husband's translation.
"It was fear all the time," she said. "There was no safe place."
Saker arrived in the U.S. in late March 2015 with $300 and began frantically looking for a job, he said. He found a part-time position at the deli counter of the North Yarmouth Hannaford and took to work with the motivation of the desperate.
"I had three kids and a fourth one on the way," he said. "I was working so hard, and when you work hard anywhere in the world, but especially in the United States, they reward you."
At Hannaford, Saker moved quickly to a full-time position and then received a promotion to deli supervisor in Portland. But he was struggling to save while also sending money back to feed and house his family. And they were once again stymied by the intricacies of the immigration system. Now that Saker was in the United States, if he sponsored his wife, he'd need to sponsor each of their children, too, he recalled.
The reward for the Saker family came in the form of help. Over the last year, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project and Rep. Chellie Pingree's office helped them navigate the immigration process and arranged for Saker's American cousin to sponsor al Shibbli.
Finally this fall, after four risky trips from Damascus to Lebanon, al Shibbli heard from the American consulate in Beirut that she would be able to come to Maine.
For her first birthday Jena got a plane ticket, and 14 hours later, she was looking hesitantly into the dark eyes and soft face of a man she'd never met.
"I knew she didn't know me," said Saker. "But I knew she would know me."

Agriculture organizations reflect on 2016, look ahead to a new year

Texto completo:   Like everything else in 2016, agriculture in Maine faced a series of ups and downs, most notably because of a severe drought that posed a huge challenge for farmers in need of water for crops and livestock.
The drought left many midsize and small-scale farmers with parched fields and struggling harvests, having to select which crops to carefully irrigate.
However, the overall production rates of state's major crop areas, such as potatoes, apples, blueberries and diversified vegetables, were consistent, according to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, but questions linger about what the new year's growing season will bring.
"It seems like we always end up saying it was a challenging year," Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walter Whitcomb said. "I don't want to fly in the face of what was a huge problem for producers, which was the drought, but I think [the increased production] speaks to the resilience of farmers."
But statewide agriculture organizations say that despite challenging conditions, 2016 was an exciting year for the overall realm of local food and farming in Maine -- a year that gives hope to continued growth in the coming 365 days.
"There's a very positive attitude about food and agriculture. It's pretty exciting to be where we are," Whitcomb said.
Over the last year Whitcomb said the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry worked to figure out how to channel this positive attitude around local food into increasing access and promoting awareness of Maine's products.
In particular, the department spent 2016 in the development stages of a new labeling campaign that will focus around promoting and identifying products that are produced using sustainable farming practices, which many Maine producers are already using, Whitcomb said.
Participation in the labeling is voluntary, but Whitcomb said it's another tool they can offer farmers to help make the consumer aware they are using sustainable soil practices and animal care.
"This is to talk about the good things that are happening on the land and with the animals," Whitcomb said.
While the labeling is still in the development phase, the new marketing campaign will see growth in 2017.
Increasing exposure of Maine products was another goal that the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry tackled in 2016, including having a booth for Maine potato, apple and broccoli producers at the Produce Marketing Association's international trade show in Orlando, Florida. This opportunity allowed these producers to network with wholesale buyers from around the globe. The department will have a booth at the 2017 trade show as well.
"We want to encourage new farmers, but also help existing farmers sell what they produce and refine their techniques in a world that is very competitive," Whitcomb said.
Next month, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry will release its first official agritourism map, which Whitcomb says will increase the exposure of small-scale and midsize farms to not only tourists coming into the state but for Mainers who want to know where they can buy local products. The map is compiled as a standard road map of the state of Maine, but bulleted across the map are 263 Maine farms, farmers markets and farm stands.
The map will be unveiled at the Maine Agricultural Trades Show on Jan. 10 and made available at rest stops and tourism centers around the state.
This year, the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association turned 45 years old. Formed in 1971, the association is the oldest and largest state organic organization in the country.
"It was an exciting year in a lot of ways, and it was a challenging year," Heather Spalding, deputy director of the association, said. "Overall, we're very encouraged."
With a demand for organic food products on the rise in Maine, as well as nationally, Spalding said the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association was busy in 2016 working with Maine's community of organic farmers, gardeners and homesteaders, broadening its reach through county chapter development and increasing the association's presence in Portland.
Organic farms must be certified annually by the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association or another regional organic farming entity that is accredited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to certify organic farms. In 2016, the association certified 515 organic farms in Maine, slightly up from last year's certification total. Additionally, while not record breaking turnout, more than 60,000 visitors attended the 40th Common Ground Country Fair. The association also enrolled 50 new farmers in its two-year Journeyperson program, which provides new organic farmers with mentorship and technical assistance ranging from soil science to business planning.
Over the last year, the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association also worked toward helping consumers of organic products in terms of access and education. By managing the CSA aspect of Maine Harvest Bucks -- a program that offers matching funds for supplemental nutrition assistance program users who buy local food -- the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association helped low-income Mainers have access to organic products.
Spalding said consumer education has been a large focus in 2016 as far as helping consumers understand what the labels on products they buy actually mean and relaying the benefits of buying and eating organic food. The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association has compiled this information on its website.
While the association's reach seems sweeping already, looking forward to the new year it hopes to engage more individuals outside of the realm of organic farmers.
"We want to do more to help consumers, homesteaders, gardeners, people who aren't connected necessarily to large-scale farms find opportunities to engage and help the mission," Spalding said. "We want to have more events and opportunities for people to get together and share ideas."
Support for protecting the land from which agriculture sprouts also was on the up in 2016, with Maine Farmland Trust receiving its largest monetary donation to date, according to Maine Farmland Trust outreach coordinator Ellen Sabina.
For Maine Farmland Trust, the donation was a boost in the 17-year lifespan of the organization, which works to protect farmland and bolster farmers. The land trust purchases easements on farmland that permanently alter the legal deed of the land to protect it from future development or subdivision, ensuring that the acreage stays forever as farmland. Since the group's organization, it has protected 55,000 acres of farmland across the state. In the last year, it has worked with 27 farms to protect 4,000 acres.
Sabina called this year's large donation "transformative," though she could not disclose the donor or the number figure associated with the donation. The donation is seeding a $50 million fundraising campaign that Maine Farmland Trust launched this year to come up with the funding to protect 125,000 acres of farmland by 2020.
The original goal was to protect 100,000 acres by 2020, but with the recent donation, Maine Farmland Trust feels it can save even more land.
"It's a vote of confidence in the work that we're doing," Sabina said. "It's also reflective of how for the local food and agriculture movement has come. People are really thinking about land in relation to their food."
2016 was a year without Maine Farmland Trust's annual Maine Fare, a two-day event that brings people together to celebrate local food through tastings and discussion. Maine Farmland Trust attributed cancellation of the Maine Fare to the amount of time that went into putting on the event.
However, Sabina said 2017 will see the semi-return of the Maine Fare, which will be brought back as a small event that "will look much different than the original festival concept."
Meanwhile in 2016 Maine Farmland Trust expanded a program and began offering Maine Harvest Bucks at select retail locations. Like the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, Maine Farmland Trust is an coordinator of the Maine Harvest Bucks program, which give matching funds to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program shoppers who buy local food so they can purchase more local fruits and vegetables.
Presently, the Harvest Bucks are only offered at a handful of small markets and food co-ops around the state, but in 2017, Maine Farmland Trust hopes to expand the program to include some traditional grocery stores.
"In our minds, down the line, it would be really exciting to have [Maine Harvest Bucks] be more in the mainstream," Sabina said.
With a strong community of agriculture organizations and interest from consumers -- despite weather challenges and uncertainties -- there is a resounding sense of hope going into the new year surrounding the prospects of local food and farming.
"It's a really exciting time for agriculture in Maine," Sabina said.

Texto completo:   The Nor'easter that blew through southern Maine Thrusday night brought unexpected snowfall to areas of the state that were forcast to escape the brunt of the storm, leaving public works crews and others unprepared.
The deep and heavy blanket of fresh snow that caused widespread power outages and slowed travel Friday morning came as a surprise to many Mainers, including the forecasters who said the storm took an unexpected turn late Thursday.
Heavier-than-expected snowfall in southern Maine challenged crews trying to keep roads and highways clear, and it caused delays in air and train travel. And areas that expected little, if any snow, were hit with widespread power outages when wet snow combined with strong winds to weigh down or break off tree limbs and knock down power lines.
Warm temperatures and bright sunshine Friday brought a lot of melting, but a hard freeze Friday night was expected to create icy roads into Saturday morning.
The nor'easter had been predicted to pummel the western foothills and mountains, with smaller accumulations forecast in southern inland sections and mostly rain on the coast.
That scenario mostly played out as expected Thursday afternoon, but it abruptly changed in the evening when cold air unexpectedly moved into southern and coastal areas and rain switched back into heavy snow, said James Brown, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray.
"The track was a little farther east late in the game, (and) that made a huge difference," Brown said. "It turned fairly early. By 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. the cold air came in and it just snowed like crazy."
That meant coastal areas such as Saco, Portland and Brunswick that were supposed to get only a few inches of snow got closer to a foot. Inland parts of Cumberland and York counties that expected 6-8 inches got double that amount, or more. Some of those towns recorded more than 20 inches of snow by Friday morning.
Naples hit the jackpot with 27 inches of snow, said Andy Pohl, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray. Snow totals varied widely across Cumberland County, where 24 inches were reported in North Sebago and 8 inches in the North Deering section of Portland.
In York County, North Waterboro got 25.6 inches of snow, while 24 inches were reported in Alfred and Acton. In Hollis, 22.5 inches fell at the home of a weather service employee, who reported as much as 5.8 inches in one hour.
"That's a pretty crazy rate," Pohl said. "Cumberland and York counties took the brunt of it."
PLOW DRIVERS GOT STUCK, TOO
The storm's unexpected shift left some towns and cities scrambling to keep roads clear.
"We didn't put a full plow operation on because we didn't expect the amount of snow we got," Portland Public Works Operations Manager Steve Earley said. The city expected 2-4 inches overnight, Earley said. But by 11 p.m., it was clear the city would have to ramp up its operation to deal with the rapidly accumulating snow. That posed another problem, because plow truck drivers called into work were getting stuck on the way in, he said.
"By morning, we had a full plow complement, but at that point you are playing catch-up," Earley said.
The storm also put pressure on Maine Department of Transportation crews, department spokesman Ted Talbot said.
"I think it is fair to say we were prepared for lighter amounts in the southern region and heavier amounts in western region," Talbot said Friday. "It wasn't a matter of being surprised, it was us needing to do more rotations, making sure shifts are adhered to, just to be ready for a more challenging storm than what was originally forecast."
The snow also posed problems for road crews. "The roads are still snow covered. This is a tough type of snow. Very heavy, sticky," Talbot said.
Primary roads were mainly clear by midmorning Friday and public safety dispatchers reported minor crashes during the morning commute. No serious injuries were reported.
The storm might have contributed to a fatal fire in Pownal. Barry Cain, 65, had lost power, and investigators believe he was using an alternative heat source when the fire started early Friday.
DOWNED POWER LINES SLOW TRAVEL
Portland declared a citywide parking ban from 10 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday so city crews can finish cleanup. Main traffic arterials were plowed Friday morning, but crews still had to get to some secondary streets.
"Residential streets are kind of a mess. Some we haven't even gotten to yet," Earley said Friday.
In some cases, it was downed power lines and not snow that slowed travel.
A section of Route 22 in Gorham was closed early Friday while crews removed a fallen tree and repaired downed utility lines. And in Portland, downed power lines were reported on Riverton Drive.
Despite the unexpected snow, many Maine businesses reported that their operations continued as usual Friday.
"We do not anticipate any major impact on shipping or deliveries," L.L. Bean spokesman Mac McKeever said.
Bath Iron Works also reported minimal disruption as the facility observed a weeklong shutdown between Christmas and New Year's Day, company spokesman David Hench said.
UNUM's Portland office was open Friday, though spokeswoman Mary Fortune said the company put contingency plans in place in case some employees were unable to safely travel to work.
Gov. Paul LePage delayed the opening of state offices until 9 a.m. Friday.
Bridgton and Rumford district courts were closed.
1-3 INCHES OF SNOW LIKELY TODAY
The Portland International Jetport, where wind gusts topped out at 32 mph Thursday, reported multiple delayed and canceled flights Friday morning, but only a handful were canceled or delayed by late Friday afternoon. The Amtrak Downeaster reported that passenger trains would be delayed up to 90 minutes because of downed trees and other storm-related issues.
At the University of Maine in Orono, the combination of heavy snow and stiff winds collapsed the Mahaney Dome, an air-supported structure used for athletic training. There were no injuries and the university is assessing the extent of the damage, assistant athletic director Will Biberstein said.
Snow is back in the forecast for New Year's Eve, with 1 to 3 inches expected to fall.
The snow will come in after dark and end in early 2017, shortly after midnight, said Chris Legro, a meteorologist with the weather service in Gray.
The cloud cover associated with the snow will keep temperatures somewhat mild, with a low around 30 expected in Portland on Saturday night into Sunday morning. Skies should slowly clear New Year's Day, Legro said, and it will be mild, with a high around 40 in southern Maine.
The next storm system is forecast to come in Tuesday, Legro said, but it will still be warm enough to produce a mix of snow and rain. Other than that, the new year's first few days should be relatively mild and calm, he said.

Texto completo:   Sears, Roebuck & Co., the battered but longstanding retailer, got a cash infusion Thursday that it hopes will help stave off store closings and stabilize its finances.
But it will be too late for at least one Maine affiliate. The Kmart in Bangor is expected to close this coming spring, according to a statement from the company.
"We can confirm that we are making the difficult but necessary decision to close the Kmart store at 688 Hogan Road in Bangor," Kmart spokesman Howard Riefs said in a prepared statement. The store, which he described as unprofitable, is expected to close in March and liquidation sales will start Jan. 6.
Sears Holdings Corp., the corporate parent of Sears and Kmart stores, said Thursday it received a letter of credit for $200 million from a group of investors under ESL Investments Inc. Terms of the deal allow the credit to be expanded to $500 million if the lenders agree.
The letter of credit "demonstrates that Sears Holdings has numerous options to finance our business strategy," said Jason M. Hollar, Sears Holdings' chief financial officer, in a release announcing the deal. The corporation operates more than 1,500 stores nationwide.
The credit financing is being arranged through Sears CEO Edward Lampert, who manages the ESL Investments hedge fund. Lampert orchestrated the merger of Sears and Kmart in 2005 and has already loaned the holding company more than $800 million to revive the flagging retail chains.
Sears, a 123-year-old retailer, lost $9 billion over the last eight years, and has been shedding underperforming stores, including 200 in this fiscal year. Business Insider reported this week that 23 Kmart stores and seven Sears stores will close in early 2017. No Maine or New Hampshire stores were listed.
Riefs said the number of workers affected by the Bangor closure was not available, but that they would be eligible to receive severance packages and to apply for work at other Kmart or Sears stores.
Kmart operates five stores in Maine, according to its website. They are in Auburn, Augusta, Bangor, Madawaska and Waterville. Last year it closed a store in Presque Isle.
Sears operates regular department stores in Augusta, Bangor, Brunswick and South Portland and its smaller "Hometown" stores in Belfast, Biddeford, Caribou, Ellsworth, Farmington, Fort Kent, Houlton, Newport and Windham.

Texto completo:   Sears, Roebuck & Co., the battered but longstanding retailer, got a cash infusion Thursday that it hopes will help stave off store closings and stabilize its finances.
But it will be too late for at least one Maine affiliate. The Kmart in Bangor is expected to close this coming spring, according to a statement from the company.
"We can confirm that we are making the difficult, but necessary decision to close the Kmart store at 688 Hogan Road in Bangor," Kmart spokesman Howard Riefs said in a prepared statement. The store, which he described as unprofitable, is expected to close in March and liquidation sales will start Jan. 6.
Sears Holdings Corp., the corporate parent of Sears and Kmart stores, said Thursday it received a letter of credit for $200 million from a group of investors under ESL Investments Inc. Terms of the deal allow the credit to be expanded to $500 million if the lenders agree.
The letter of credit "demonstrates that Sears Holdings has numerous options to finance our business strategy," said Jason M. Hollar, Sears Holdings' chief financial officer, in a release announcing the deal. The corporation operates more than 1,500 stores nationwide.
The credit financing is being arranged through Sears CEO Edward Lampert, who manages the ESL Investments hedge fund. Lampert orchestrated the merger of Sears and Kmart in 2005 and has already loaned the holding company more than $800 million to revive the flagging retail chains.
Sears, a 123-year-old retailer, lost $9 billion over the last eight years and has been shedding underperforming stores, including 200 in this fiscal year. Business Insider reported this week that 23 Kmart stores and seven Sears stores will close in early 2017. No Maine or New Hampshire stores were listed.
Riefs said the number of workers affected by the Bangor closure was not available, but that they would be eligible to receive severance packages and to apply for work at other Kmart or Sears stores.
Kmart operates five stores in Maine, according to its website. They are in Auburn, Augusta, Bangor, Madawaska and Waterville. Last year it closed a store in Presque Isle.
Sears operates regular department stores in Augusta, Bangor, Brunswick and South Portland and its smaller Hometown stores in Belfast, Biddeford, Caribou, Ellsworth, Farmington, Fort Kent, Houlton, Newport and Windham.

Resumen: Oak Hill field hockey wins 1st state title When any high school sports program wins a state championship, that's more than enough reason to celebrate. [...]it was back in October for the Oak Hill field hockey team, when it won it the Class C state title.

Texto completo:   1. Even before the wins and championships, Paula Doughty was thinking big.
It was 1974, and Doughty was taking over a fledgling Skowhegan field hockey program, borne out of Title IX. The Indians had no clout within the state. Their coach sought to change that.
"I remember playing Cony and Gardiner, those teams that had big tradition," Doughty said. "I can remember thinking to myself 'That's my goal. To build a field hockey program that has the kind of tradition Cony does or Gardiner does.' "
Few coaches of any sport in Maine history could check off an objective so emphatically. Already an icon in the sport, Doughty added a glowing number to her resume this fall when she became the first coach ever to win 500 games, making it official with a 15-0 defeat of Lewiston on Oct. 4.
"I think it's a huge accomplishment for the field hockey program at Skowhegan in general," Doughty said. "I was really overwhelmed with that day. I'm not usually overwhelmed like that, but I think all the memories just came flooding back.
"I've had 20 coaches, thousands of kids and hundreds of parents. Skowhegan field hockey is a real community thing."
And the state's most decorated program. That Indians team that lifted Doughty to the milestone finished the way so many of her teams have, by winning the Class A state title. It's now 17 state championships for Skowhegan, including 14 in the last 16 years, but Doughty said there's no one stat, 500 wins included, she values most.
"It's one total picture," she said. "I've never been one to get involved in streaks or numbers, I'm not into the numbers game. Every year is its own challenge."
After the Lewiston win, Doughty and her players gathered for a photo, and she invited all her former players at the game to join in. Considering her approach to the job, it was a fitting gesture.
"Oh, definitely being with the kids" Doughty answered when asked about her favorite part of coaching. "I love the kids, all my coaching staff loves the kids, and I love the game."
2. Oak Hill field hockey wins 1st state title
When any high school sports program wins a state championship, that's more than enough reason to celebrate.
When that program wins at the hands of the team that ousted it from winning a state title the year before? Well, that's just a cherry on top of the sundae.
So it was back in October for the Oak Hill field hockey team, when it won it the Class C state title. Not only did the Raiders win the first field hockey title in school history, but it was a 2-0 victory over Maine Central Institute, beating the same team that had knocked Oak Hill out of the state title game last year, by the exact same score.
"In August, we put down what our goals were. And it was to get back," Oak Hill coach Betsy Gilbert said at the time. "They had their first taste of it, and they wanted to get back.... Our motto this year was 'all or nothing.' They were giving their all, and we really were not stopping until we got here."
The Raiders came back at a furious pace. Over 18 games, Oak Hill scored 87 goals, an average of almost five goals per game. Defensively, the Raiders allowed just seven goals for the entire season, posting 12 shutouts.
Still, the season didn't come without its challenges. Oak Hill slipped by with a 2-1 win over Winthrop on Oct. 5, and the Raiders edged St. Dominic 3-2 in the regional final. And the one blemish on Oak Hill's 17-1 record was a 1-0 loss to Dirigo on Sept. 19.
But the Raiders rose above it and returned to the Class C state title game a more seasoned squad, which showed when they took the field against the Huskies.
"(We) came in very headstrong, a lot different than what we did last year," Gilbert said. "This year, they knew what to expect. They knew it would be loud, they knew it was going to be intense. You couldn't let up for one second."
Lexi Fuller and Erika Hannigan each scored a goal for Oak Hill, and Mackenzie Thibeault had six saves to secure a place in school history.
3. Peter Del Gallo and his incredible run
There was no one left to beat, nowhere left to climb. Gardiner wrestler Peter Del Gallo knew what the victory meant, and more importantly, what it had given him the right to say.
"In this match, I showed I was the best 120-pounder in New England," Del Gallo said.
Whether he was just stating a fact or throwing a dash of chest-pounding in with it, Del Gallo had earned the right to do both. The victory was over Connor McGonagle in the New England Championships, completing both an astonishing senior season and stellar career for the Gardiner standout.
Del Gallo -- part of a prestigious wrestling family whose brothers, Matthew and Daniel, also won state titles for Gardiner -- won state championships in all four years, but was especially dominant in his senior campaign. After putting together an undefeated season (52-0) and rolling to the Maine state title, Del Gallo headed off to the New Englands, where he won a title at 106 pounds as a freshman, but where he had also suffered four of the five blemishes in what ended up a 185-5 career record.
Del Gallo made the most of his final crack at the regional spotlight, winning the first three matches without giving up a point, the last a 4-0 semifinal win over Alec Opsal of New Milford, Connecticut. That set up a final showdown with McGonagle of wrestling power Timberlane (N.H.), and Del Gallo didn't let his opponent get the upper hand. He earned a takedown and two more points for a 4-0 lead, and after McGonagle got two back for a reversal, Del Gallo countered with a takedown on his way to a 7-2 victory and an emphatic closing statement to his high school career.
"Today, I dominated," Del Gallo said after the match. "You always have to have the mentality that no one is better than you. ... This feels amazing, just amazing. I won it here as a freshman and won it here as a senior. I made a sandwich."
Peter was the third Del Gallo to come along, and his four state championships brought the haul to 11 for the family. But with two New England crowns to his name, there's no question he's done plenty enough to stand alone.
"I feel that Peter is one of the best high school wrestlers ever in the state," Tigers coach Matt Hanley said in April, "if not the best."
4. 1995 Cony High girls basketball inducted into Maine Basketball Hall of Fame
It was the highest honor the state could give, going to one of the best girls basketball teams it had ever seen.
The Cony girls basketball team that went 22-0 and won the Class A state championship in 1995 became the first girls team to be inducted into the Maine Basketball Hall of Fame during a ceremony at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor in August.
The players from the team, some traveling from as far as Louisiana, met up in Bangor to relive those days and celebrate the distinction.
"It's a great honor," said Cony athletic director Paul Vachon, who guided both that Rams team and the next year's to perfect 22-0 records. "It's pretty special, for us anyway. We were quite honored and humbled by it, for sure."
Once Cindy Blodgett left Lawrence, there was no stopping Cony in either 1994-95 or 95-96. The Rams had only one senior, Mary Beth Coughlin, but were wise beyond their years after tussles with Blodgett's Bulldogs, including a loss in the 1994 tournament.
"No doubt about it," Vachon said. "We got a lot of experience as a young age. ... (Lawrence was) better than we were, but we never backed down."
Once the 1994-95 season began, it became clear that the balance of power had shifted as Cony began burying the opposition.
"They never took anyone lightly, and they worked extremely hard," Vachon said. "They were special in that way. ... They had some experience with losses early in their careers, and they didn't like it."
The Rams were selfless and complementary on the court. Eventual University of Maine player Amy Vachon ran the show as the point guard, but in players like Christine Huber and Coughlin, Cony had the players to attack the way they wanted.
"Amy was the leader of the team," Coach Vachon said, "but they all knew their roles, so we really didn't have anyone that anyone could really try to shut down. Everybody knew their roles, and everybody played a special part in the team."
5. Richmond softball wins state title
It's slowly closing in on the same constant as death and taxes. The Richmond softball team continues to win games and rack up Class D state titles.
It happened again in June, when the Bobcats cruised to a 15-6 victory over Stearns to win its fourth consecutive state championship. Richmond also lengthened its win streak from 52 to 70 consecutive wins.
The win marked the eighth softball title in Richmond history. The Bobcats and Madison (1994-97) are the only schools that boast a stretch of four consecutive state titles.
There was one major difference during this particular championship run. It was the first time in 30 years someone other than Rick Coughlin served as the head coach of the program. During that period, Coughlin led the Bobcats to all seven of its previous titles, leading the squad to the first 52 wins of its current streak.
Tony Martin -- father of Meranda Martin, one of Richmond's top players -- stepped in and provided a steady hand to continue the program's winning ways. Martin dedicated the state title win over Stearns to Coughlin.
"We were planning to win this game for Rick. That's what we did," Martin said after the game.
Meranda Martin led the Bobcats with four runs and two RBIs during the state title game, and earned the win in the circle over a tough Stearns lineup that collected 12 hits during the contest. Sydney Tilton and Kalah Patterson each had three hits and three RBIs, while Caitlin Kendrick had three hits -- including a triple -- and two RBIs.
Needless to say, Richmond's achievements sets up pressure this spring for a possible record-breaking fifth consecutive title.
6. Amy Vachon inducted into Maine Sports Hall of Fame
As a player at Cony High School in the '90s, Amy Vachon was one of the top girls basketball players in state history. Now, Vachon is among the top athletes in Maine, with her induction this year to the Maine Sports Hall of Fame.
As a senior at Cony in 1996, Vachon was named Miss Maine Basketball. She went on to a standout career at the University of Maine, helping to lead the Black Bears to four straight appearances in the NCAA tournament and two America East titles. Vachon set Maine and America East records for assists.
Vachon is currently the associate head coach for women's basketball at her alma mater.
7. Erskine golf wins first state title
Erskine Academy golf coach Mark Bailey knew his team would be good. He remembers when he realized it could actually be great.
"The first match of the year, we went over to play Gardiner, and we'd had some really tough matches with Gardiner, had trouble beating them at their place," he said. "We shot 160 as a team for that particular match, and we'd never played well over there at all.
"I thought 'Wow.' And I didn't feel like a couple of the kids played their best. That's when it kind of fell together."
The year that started well ended perfectly for Erskine, as the Eagles fired a 317 at the Class B state championships to hold off defending champion Cape Elizabeth and win their first state golf championship.
"It was really hard for me to believe that it really happened," said Bailey, whose team didn't finish better than fifth the previous three seasons.
Bailey had a deep group, led by Kennebec Journal Golfer of the Year Aaron Pion as well as Justin Browne, Connor Paine and Robert Harmon. Erskine won the KVAC B Shootout to clinch a spot in the state championships, then, led by Pion's 77, shot three strokes better than Bailey's hopeful target of 320 at Natanis Golf Course.
Still, the Eagles had to find out if it was good enough.
"At the end of a basketball game, you know for sure that you've won," Bailey said. "We're sitting there watching these scores come in, and we knew who to watch for. (Cape Elizabeth) had one score that hadn't come in yet. We calculated it out and it was like 'This person's going to have to break par for us not to win.' "
The score came in and wasn't close to what the Capers needed, and the celebration could begin -- one the Erskine players had been telling Bailey they could win since before the season even started.
"From the outside, it was certainly an underdog-type situation," Bailey said. "But these guys had a lot of confidence in themselves, for sure."
8. MCI wins football state title
After back-to-back losses in the Class D state championship game, Maine Central Institute finally broke its title drought, with one of the most memorable finishes in Maine state championship game history.
Tied with Lisbon, 14-14, with 3 seconds to play in the state final at Portland's Fitzpatrick Stadium, the Huskies lined up for a potential game-winning 37-yard field goal. However, holder Eli Bussell dropped the snap, setting up a play built on instinct and football savy.
Bussell picked up the ball, yelled "fire!" and took off. He raced 20 yards down the right sideline, untouched, scoring the game-winning touchdown with no time left. MCI 20, Lisbon 14, and the Huskies were state champions for the first time since 1974.
"Pefect snap. Horrible hold," Bussell said in the moments right after the game. "I yelled 'Fire!', got around the corner, and Adam (Bertrand) gave me a great block that got me in the end zone."
The win capped a season in which the Huskies dominated the Little Ten Conference, going undefeated and outscoring conference opponents 468-100, including playoff wins over Bucksport and Dexter. It was thie third consecutive conference title for MCI.
Head coach Tom Bertrand won his 100th career game this season as well.
9. Closing of Sukee Arena
The season hadn't even started, and high school hockey in Maine had already been dealt a serious blow.
Due to problems with ice-making equipment, Sukee Arena in Winslow made the decision in November to remain closed for the winter, putting even further strain on a sport that has chronic problems with finding ice time and available arenas for its member schools -- not to mention the youth and adult leagues that called the rink home.
At the high school level, the decision took home ice away from the Winslow, Messalonskee and Lawrence/Skowhegan boys and Winslow/Gardiner girls teams, and forced other rinks in the area -- many already handling packed schedules of their own -- to try to accommodate the displaced squads. The Camden National Bank Ice Vault in Hallowell jumped into the fray, as did Kents Hill's Bonnefond Ice Arena and Colby College's Alfond Rink.
"The first thing we've tried to do is be as equitable as we can for all the high school teams, and that becomes a bit challenging," Colby men's hockey coach Blaise MacDonald said in November. "We've had Waterville in here for years, but we want to do our best for all the other teams, both boys and girls."
The surrounding arenas have made it work, but it hasn't been easy. The leftover time slots have required teams to cope with odd hours and late nights. Colby made its arena available at 5 a.m., for example.
"The goal of all three rinks is to try and make this work for everybody where it fits into our scheduling, while not disrupting the entire state of Maine," Ice Vault general manager Bill Boardman said in November. "Someone's probably going to have to do more early morning practices than they might like, and there will probably be some sharing of ice time and moving things around."
10. Nick Mayo's big year
A Messalonskee High School graduate, Mayo didn't waste any time getting used to playing Division I college basketball. As a freshman at Eastern Kentucky University, the 6-foot-9, 235-pound Mayo established himself as one of the top players in the Ohio Valley Conference.
Mayo averaged 14.5 points and 4.9 rebounds per game last season, starting all 31 games for the Colonels. Following the season, Mayo was named the OVC freshman of the year and earned first team all-conference honors.
Now a sophomore, Mayo has continued his strong play. Through the first 15 games of the season, Mayo averaged 18 points, 6.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game.

3. Waterville hockey wins state title
Andrew Roderigue's slapshot in the second overtime was the exclamtion point on the season for the Waterville Senior High School hockey team, which won the Class B state championship when Roderigue's blast found the back of the net, giving the Purple Panthers a 3-2 win over Yarmouth.
The state title was the 21st for the Waterville hockey program, first in Class B, and first since winning the Class A title in 2009.
The Panthers went 19-1-1, winning games over rivals Winslow and Messalonskee in the regional semifinals and finals. Roderigue's winning goal came with 2:47 left in the second overtime against Yarmouth, and capped a comeback from an early 2-0 deficit.
Waterville won with a deep, well-rounded team. Seven players scored 29 or more points, and Roderigue, a defenseman, led the Panthers with 28 goals. Goalie Nathan Pinnette posted a 2.13 goals against average and an .896 save percentage.

The surrounding arenas have made it work, but it hasn't been easy. The leftover time slots have required teams to cope with odd hours and late nights. Colby made its arena available at 5 a.m., for example.
"The goal of all three rinks is to try and make this work for everybody where it fits into our scheduling, while not disrupting the entire state of Maine," Ice Vault general manager Bill Boardman said in November. "Someone's probably going to have to do more early morning practices than they might like, and there will probably be some sharing of ice time and moving things around."
5. John "Jack" Kelley inducted into Maine Hall of Fame
It was a good year for Kelley, who not only was inducted into the Maine Sports Hall of Fame, but celebrated another Stanley Cup win with a member of his family.
Kelley had two stints as men's hockey coach at Colby, from 1955-62 and 1976-77. A member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, Kelley coached Boston University to a pair of national championships, led the Hartford Whalers to the AVCO Cup as champions of the WHL, and was president of the Pittsburgh Penguins. As a player at BU, Kelley played in the NCAA finals twice and was an all-ECAC selection.
In August, Kelley looked on as his grandson, Andy Saucier, brought the Stanley Cup to a public viewing at Colby College's Alfond Rink. As the video coach for the Penguins, Saucier was given one day with the cup. It was the fourth Cup celebration since 2010 for the Kelley family. Kelley's son, Mark Kelley, is the vice president of amateur scouting for the Chicago Blackhawks, and has been a part of three Cup wins for the Blackhawks in recent seasons.
6. Area stars inducted into Maine Basketball Hall of Fame
Mike McGee, Kevin Whitmore and Gregg Frame were inducted into the Maine Basketball Hall of Fame in August, in a ceremony at the Cross Center in Bangor.
McGee was a standout high school player at Lawrence High School, before going on to play at Colby College and Clark University. McGee coached boys basketball at Lawrence for 31 years, winning 350 games and two state championships, before retiring after the 2013 season.
Whitmore played at Waterville Senior High School before a college career at Colby. Playing for his father, Dick Whitmore, Kevin scored 1,357 for the Mules and was an All-American in 1991.
Also a Waterville High grad, Frame went on to score more than 1,000 points at Dartmouth College.
7. Nick Mayo's big year
A Messalonskee High School graduate, Mayo didn't waste any time getting used to playing Division I college basketball. As a freshman at Eastern Kentucky University, the 6-foot-9, 235-pound Mayo established himself as one of the top players in the Ohio Valley Conference.
Mayo averaged 14.5 points and 4.9 rebounds per game last season, starting all 31 games for the Colonels. Following the season, Mayo was named the OVC freshman of the year and earned first team all-conference honors.
Now a sophomore, Mayo has continued his strong play. Through the first 15 games of the season, Mayo averaged 18 points, 6.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game.
8. Madison softball wins state title
The Madison softball team is on a roll, and it's a roll that is wakening the echoes of the 1990s.
In June, the Bulldogs wrapped up a 20-0 season with a 3-1 victory over Bucksport for the Class C state championship. It's the second state title within the past three years in Madison, and the eighth overall softball championship in school history.
The current success of the Bulldogs harkens back to their dynasty period of 1994-1997, when Madison won four consecutive state championships. Only Richmond (2013-2016 in Class D) can lay such a claim in state history.
The Bulldogs won their current state title in dramatic fashion. Tied 1-1 going into the sixth inning, Madison catcher Aly LeBlanc -- daughter of head coach Chris LeBlanc -- belted a triple down the right field line, scoring Madeline Wood all the way from first base. LeBlanc later scored on a sacrifice fly from Erin Whalen for the final 3-1 score.
It was a huge at-bat for LeBlanc, who had missed out on hits in her previous two at-bats
"I just told (Aly) to relax, do what she needs to do, and hit the ball," Chris LeBlanc said. "We talked to (the team) outside before the game and just told them it doesn't matter what you do the at-bats before. When you get up there, you're 0-0 every time you get up to bat. It was great for her to hit that ball."
Wood struck out seven to earn the win in the circle for the Bulldogs.
"I think her and Aly have a great rapport," Chris LeBlanc said. "As I've always said, you've got to be mentally tough to (pitch), and Madeline Wood is. And we've got one more year with her."
Indeed, Wood returns and leads a talented group that will be a favorite to once again claim the Class C crown.
9. Erskine golf wins first state title
Erskine Academy golf coach Mark Bailey knew his team would be good. He remembers when he realized it could actually be great.
"The first match of the year, we went over to play Gardiner, and we'd had some really tough matches with Gardiner, had trouble beating them at their place," he said. "We shot 160 as a team for that particular match, and we'd never played well over there at all.
"I thought 'Wow.' And I didn't feel like a couple of the kids played their best. That's when it kind of fell together."
The year that started well ended perfectly for Erskine, as the Eagles fired a 317 at the Class B state championships to hold off defending champion Cape Elizabeth and win their first state golf championship.
"It was really hard for me to believe that it really happened," said Bailey, whose team didn't finish better than fifth the previous three seasons.
Bailey had a deep group, led by Kennebec Journal Golfer of the Year Aaron Pion as well as Justin Browne, Connor Paine and Robert Harmon. Erskine won the KVAC B Shootout to clinch a spot in the state championships, then, led by Pion's 77, shot three strokes better than Bailey's hopeful target of 320 at Natanis Golf Course.
Still, the Eagles had to find out if it was good enough.
"At the end of a basketball game, you know for sure that you've won," Bailey said. "We're sitting there watching these scores come in, and we knew who to watch for. (Cape Elizabeth) had one score that hadn't come in yet. We calculated it out and it was like 'This person's going to have to break par for us not to win.' "
The score came in and wasn't close to what the Capers needed, and the celebration could begin -- one the Erskine players had been telling Bailey they could win since before the season even started.
"From the outside, it was certainly an underdog-type situation," Bailey said. "But these guys had a lot of confidence in themselves, for sure."
10. Valley boys get back on top
Last winter, the Valley boys basketball team partied like it was 2003.
That was the last time the Cavaliers won a Class D state championship -- the last of a string of six consecutive titles. The win was a monkey-off-the-back moment for Valley, which lost three state championships (2004, 2005, 2014) before defeating Easton 55-44 to claim the school's seventh title.
"We finally ended the drought," Cody Laweryson said after the game. "We finally got the state championship we've been looking forward to since this summer."
Laweryson was a major reason why the Cavaliers made their way back to glory. The now-graduated 6-foot-4 swingman had averaged 24 points per game entering the contest, and led Valley with 18 points in the state championship game. But Laweryson wasn't alone in the offensive output, as Collin Miller added 16 points and eight rebounds. Austin Cates chipped in with 11 points.
"The state game two years ago against Hodgdon was a huge difference in our team this time," Valley coach Luke Hartwell said. "We didn't get rattled, we didn't get scared. We embraced the moment."
Hartwell said the Cavaliers had success using their 10 spread-out play, a scheme designed to get the ball in Laweryson's hands. Needless to say, the strategy worked, and history was once again made for the Bingham-based school.
"It's amazing," Miller said. "Our whole team is going to be part of that tradition now. Just bringing the Gold Ball back to make it seven now is huge for the community. It's a great community and they all have our backs and that's what we love about playing for Valley."

Texto completo:   Longtime Portland Press Herald editor and columnist Michael D. Harmon died of a single gunshot wound to the neck, the state medical examiner's office said Friday.
Harmon was killed Wednesday at his Sanford home. He was showing a handgun to a teenage visitor when it went off as the 16-year-old boy handled it, police said.
The boy and his father, who was present at the time of the shooting, are not related to Harmon, Maine State Police spokesman Stephen McCausland said Friday. Harmon knew both of them "for many years," McCausland said. The shooting will be reviewed by the Maine attorney general's office.
McCausland said the boy and his father, both from North Berwick, have been cooperating with the investigation. Their names and details about the incident are not being released because of the ongoing investigation, he said.
A relative reached on Friday at Harmon's home said the family would have no comment on the shooting. On Thursday, Harmon's wife, Margaret Harmon, declined to discuss details of the shooting, calling it an "accidental tragedy."

Court revives guilty verdict in Skakel case

Texto completo:   Connecticut's highest court on Friday reinstated the murder conviction of Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel for the 1975 slaying of 15-year-old Martha Moxley, paving the way for his possible return to prison in a closely watched saga that has played out for decades.
A majority of the Connecticut Supreme Court rejected Skakel's claims that his former lawyer, Michael Sherman, provided inadequate representation during the high-profile 2002 trial.
Skakel's appellate lawyers argued that Sherman failed to fully investigate and implicate Skakel's brother in the crime and did not call a key alibi witness. They also said he failed to call additional witnesses to discredit prosecution testimony that Skakel implicated himself in the murder while he was at a treatment center in Maine, among other missteps.
"We conclude . . . that Sherman's performance was not deficient and thus could not have deprived the petitioner of a constitutionally adequate defense," Justice Peter T. Zarella wrote in the 69-page majority opinion.
Neither Skakel's appellate lawyers nor state prosecutors in Connecticut could be reached for comment Friday night.
But Sherman said in a brief phone interview that he takes no satisfaction from the ruling.
"I know I'm supposed to feel vindicated," said Sherman, who argued at the trial that a live-in Skakel family tutor may have committed the crime. "But honestly, I don't. The bottom line is that Michael Skakel was wrongfully convicted on my watch."
But John Benedict, the prosecutor who tried the case 14 years ago, said by phone that he never doubted Skakel's guilt and praised the high court justices, who he said "made what we thought was the correct decision" after careful consideration.
"We're not surprised," said Benedict, who is now retired. "It was obviously a difficult situation for the Supreme Court, and I feel that we presented a really, really strong argument."
Skakel, now in his mid-50s, could not be reached for comment. He has been living in Westchester County, New York, with a GPS ankle bracelet, since a lower court judge freed him in 2013 after ruling that he did not receive a fair trial.
It was not clear Friday when, or if, Skakel will be sent back to prison.
His appellate lawyer, Hubert Santos, told the Hartford Courant that he has 10 days to ask the Connecticut high court to reconsider the decision, and if that fails, he will seek a review by the US Supreme Court.
Skakel will appear for a hearing in Superior Court to determine whether he will be sent back to prison immediately or remain free on bond while his lawyers pursue further appeals.
The decades-old murder in one of Connecticut's wealthiest towns has drawn celebrity-like attention with its links to the Kennedy family. Skakel is the nephew of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy.
Numerous books and documentaries chronicling competing legal theories of Moxley's murder have been made.
Moxley was pummeled with a golf club and stabbed repeatedly with its broken shaft in the yard of her family's Greenwich home, after spending time at the neighboring Skakel estate on the evening of Oct. 30, 1975.
Skakel, who was also 15 at the time and whose father was Ethel Kennedy's brother, was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. In 2013, an appellate judge overturned the conviction on the grounds that Skakel received an inadequate defense.
Though Skakel was long considered a suspect in the murder, he was not formally charged for nearly 25 years, as prosecutors built a case mainly on circumstantial evidence and "numerous, incriminating statements made by [Skakel] himself" a few years later at the Elan School in Maine, a treatment center for troubled adolescents, Zarella wrote.
The high court's ruling could prompt a new round of theories about Moxley's murder.
Four justices sided with prosecutors, two sided with Skakel, and one justice published a split opinion, concurring with the majority in part and dissenting in part.
In the main, 61-page dissenting opinion, Justice Richard N. Palmer wrote that Sherman's representation fell "far below the range of competence necessary to satisfy [Skakel's] right to the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution."
Among Sherman's miscues was his "manifestly incompetent" handling of Skakel's alibi defense that he was with friends at a separate location at the time of the murder, Palmer wrote. Moxley's family could not be reached for comment.
One of Skakel's prominent backers is his cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who earlier this year published "Framed," a book about the case alleging that Moxley's killers were two Bronx youths who traveled to Greenwich for pre-Halloween mischief and were never pursued seriously by authorities.
State criminal justice officials have derided the book as "baseless," but Kennedy, a former prosecutor, told the Globe in July that the investigation was flawed. "No one was asking the right questions," Kennedy, the son of the US senator and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, said when the book was published.
According to witness testimony, Skakel told a fellow resident of the Elan School that he "killed a girl with a golf club," Zarella's ruling said.
However, witnesses also testified that he at other times denied involvement in the killing.

While they are allowed to possess marijuana for medical purposes, patients or their families must figure out how to bring the drug into Georgia because efforts have failed so far to expand the law to allow marijuana cultivation in the state.

To get more information, see the state Department of Public Health's registry web page: www.dph. georgia.gov/low-thc-oilregistry. State Rep.Allen Peake, who led the effort to pass Georgia's medical marijuana law in 2015, has indicated that he will push during the coming legislative session for an expansion of the d
Seven states passed marijuana initiatives on Nov. 8, which ordinarily would have injected new life into the push to expand Georgia's tiny medical cannabis program.
But those advocates must now wonder whether the incoming Trump administration will quash their enthusiasm. While the president-elect himself has said marijuana policy should be left up to the states, his nominee for attorney general, U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., has been a fierce critic of the drug, which remains federally classified as a harmful and illegal substance.
State Rep.Allen Peake, R-Macon, the driving force behind the 2015 creation of Georgia's limited marijuana operation, said he will ask lawmakers in 2017 to at the very least expand the number of conditions that qualify for the state's program.His "home run"scenario is for his legislative colleagues and Gov. Nathan Deal to agree to a narrowly tailored in-state program to grow and cultivate cannabis for medicinal purposes.
Peake said more than 1,000 Georgians are now registered to legally possess cannabis oil to treat one of eight conditions that qualify for the program. The positives of the program far outweigh any negative, he said.
"The sky has not fallen," Peake said. "We've not seen a significant uptick of people driving while intoxicated with medical cannabis oil. It hasn't become a public health hazard."
It's not just the governor who opposes expanding the program. Many prosecutors and law enforcement agencies have, too. The Faith and Freedom Coalition, a Duluth-based group that advocates for social conservative causes, has made blocking expansion of the program a top goal for the coming legislative session.
In 2015, the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police opposed the original bill that created the state's current medical marijuana law, calling it the "camel's nose in the tent" toward full legalization. Many states that now allow recreational use of the drug first legalized it for medicinal purposes.
Frank Rotondo, the executive director of the police chiefs' organization, said his board will wait to see any new legislation before taking a position. But, he said, their past concerns remain unchanged. For example, states have yet to find safe, accurate and efficient ways to test whether a motorist is under the influence of marijuana, he said.
"From a law enforcement perspective, it's a public

safety issue," Rotondo said.
For patients already in the state program, the largest impediment, however, remains where to get the oil. While Deal and the General Assembly agreed to allow Georgians to legally possess the oil, they did not agree to allow it to be produced here.
So families and patients on the state's medical marijuana registry must buy it and have it delivered, or they can travel to other states to buy it and risk arrest while transporting it home. Peake said he's not aware of any Georgian who has been arrested for doing so. The oil that is available via mail is less potent than what Georgia law allows and what many patients need.
Blaine Cloud, a leading advocate for expanding Georgia's program and the father of a child on the registry, said many families are turning to a third, more dangerous way to get the oil: cooking it themselves.
Cloud, in a letter to lawmakers, said some Georgians are buying marijuana illegally and turning it into cannabis oil in their own kitchens.
"We knew some people would have to resort to this," he said, "but more people are doing it than we initially thought."
Cloud vowed to return to the state Capitol in January when lawmakers convene to fight "to get actual access to the medicine we're allowed to possess."
Peake said he hopes to convince Deal that enough states have adopted medical marijuana laws that the risk is worth it, something he's been unable to do the past two years.
"The issue is coming across the country," Peake said, noting that 28 states and the District of Columbia now allow the use of marijuana for medical or recreational purposes. "Access and cultivation in the state is coming to Georgia."
The question, he said, is whether Deal wants to tackle it or let the next governor, elected in 2018, address it.
Jen Talaber Ryan, Deal's communications director, said the office does not comment on pending legislation.
JJ McKay, the publisher of the Fresh Toast, a news and lifestyle website with a focus on cannabis, said 60 percent of Americans now live in a state where a form of marijuana is legal.
"Look at the people it helps," McKay said. "Opioids is a raging national problem. Marijuana, if done correctly with the right supervision, is a better alternative and less harsh on both the system and the person."
McKay does not believe, meanwhile, that Sessions, if he's confirmed as attorney general, will necessarily be an impediment to expansion of marijuana laws in the states.
"Jeff Sessions is anti-marijuana," McKay said. "But Jeff Sessions is anti many things. He has a full plate, and you're walking into a system where it would be very difficult to overturn things in 28 states."
Legal marijuana is a $7.1 billion industry that produces hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue for states, McKay said. Florida, which voted for a medical marijuana program in November that includes the in-state cultivation Peake wants, is expected to see a $1 billion tax benefit, McKay said.
Plus, he said, President-elect Donald Trump has said marijuana policy should be left to the states.
"Will Sessions make it harder? Maybe," McKay said. "Will he be able to overturn it? Doubtful."

Texto completo:   Bank goes here and here and here and also on a third line here pleasexy
The perennial national title contender from Durham, N.C., is 12-1 as it enters its ACC opener at Virginia Tech on Saturday. It is loaded with talent, even by its own lofty standards. Its only loss came by two points on a neutral court against another blue blood (Kansas).
And yet the question seems to persist, especially after lethargic victories over capable, veteran, well-coached mid-majors Elon and Tennessee State last week: What's wrong with Duke?
On the surface, this seems almost laughable. Yes, there's star guard Grayson Allen's habit of tripping opponents, and his latest transgression earned him an indefinite suspension. The No. 5 Blue Devils will miss him, but they enjoy enough options to withstand his absence.
There are 350 other Division I programs, and the number that would trade their problems for Coach Mike Krzyzewski's might reach double figures. Maybe. It isn't a long list.
Then again, there is this:
The Fayetteville (N.C.) Observer's Stephen Schramm dug a little deeper into Duke's concerns, and one thing stands out. The Blue Devils' rotation development was stunted by injuries to freshmen Marques Bolden, Harry Giles and Jayson Tatum, and Allen's looming absence doesn't help.
Tatum missed eight games but seamlessly fit into Duke's operation when he returned for victories over Maine, Florida and UNLV. Bolden and Giles have made modest on-court contributions since their respective returns.
It was only too easy to assume some simple math would occur. Take an exceptional team, add two really talented freshmen to the post rotation and - voila! - the Blue Devils would be an unstoppable force.
That might end up being the long-term outcome for Duke, but it also ignores the difficulty of adding pieces to a rotation on the fly and hoping they can stick. When those pieces are freshmen, there isn't even some measure of familiarity from a previous season to fall back upon.
Little wonder, then, that two returnees have provided much of Duke's stability in the opening six weeks of the season. Sophomore guard Luke Kennard has gone from useful sixth man to efficient star, shooting 52 percent from the field while averaging 20.4 points. There's a case to be made he's playing even better than Allen did last year.
Fifth-year senior Amile Jefferson is once again among the country's most reliable post players, averaging 14.2 points and 10.8 rebounds after playing only nine games last season because of a broken right foot.
Entering Friday, Duke ranked third in the country in adjusted offensive efficiency according to KenPom.com and eighth in defensive efficiency. The Blue Devils figured to be an offensive monster, and they are. Defensively, they're not Louisville nor Virginia, but they're considerably better than last season (when they were shorthanded) and the 2013-14 season (when Duke was an offensive juggernaut but rarely stopped good teams and paid the price when it lost to Mercer in the first round of the NCAA tournament).
It all looks good, but at some point Duke is going to have to mesh all of its pieces together. At this point, that means three players have to progress from their current situations.
Marques Bolden: The 6-foot-11, 245-pounder returned at the same time Tatum did, a Dec. 3 rout of Maine. But in the five games since Bolden debuted after missing eight contests with a leg injury, he has averaged 2.6 points, 1.2 rebounds and 7.2 minutes.
Jefferson's presence (and efficiency) is a clear obstacle to greater playing time for the freshman. In the two games last week, Bolden played nine minutes total and had a missed shot, an assist and a foul. Duke has the luxury of bringing him along at a judicious pace.
Harry Giles: The 6-10, 240-pounder from Winston-Salem, N.C., was always going to be a wild card this season. He tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in 2013, and then suffered the same injury in his right knee in November 2015. Then came arthroscopic knee surgery this fall.
It delayed Giles's college debut until December; unlike Bolden, Giles didn't get in a month or so of practice before the season, so there could be an even greater adjustment period. He logged 10 minutes combined last week, managing a point and two rebounds in the victory over Elon. How soon Duke can expect him to be a steady contributor remains to be seen, but he is available to help.
Grayson Allen: With the junior, there are two variables. One, how long will his suspension last? Two, how will he respond when he is reinstated?
There are no hints yet as to when Allen will be back. Duke opens conference play against Virginia Tech on Saturday, followed by home games against Georgia Tech and Boston College and road games against Florida State and Louisville. A cynic might suggest the guard will be in the lineup by the time the Blue Devils face Louisville. At the same time, less than a year ago, a high-major player (Oregon State's Jarmal Reid) earned a four-game suspension for tripping an official. That's hardly a binding precedent, but it is an example of how a similar situation was handled.
However long Allen's absence is, he will return to a team that has further incorporated Bolden and especially Giles. At that point, the Blue Devils will adjust again and perhaps finally start to figure out just what they will be once they're fully whole. Mid-January is a bit late for a national title contender to develop rotational continuity, but that's the fate that befalls Coach K's team this season.

Texto completo:   Trump's nuclear threat
As a grandfather and someone who grew up during the Cold War, I was amazed to see the "Tweeter in Chief" going off about nuclear weapons. A year ago, he didn't even know what the nuclear triad was.
I knew early on about that triad, as I grew up near a submarine base, along with General Dynamics Electric Boat, where nuclear submarines were made. I can still remember the fear I felt every time the sirens went off. The U.S. and Russia have almost 15,000 nuclear warheads combined, and that is already too many. A dozen a piece would end life as we know it.
So why would any rational president-elect go against the progress made by every president since Richard Nixon in reducing these weapons? Donald Trump's erratic behavior has already destabilized the world, and he is not even president.

Invest in broadband to help rural towns
Maine is already a wonderful state, but it has enormous untapped potential. With smart policies, we can leverage our human and natural resources to build a stronger economy and better jobs for generations to come.
I was honored to be named House chair of the Energy, Utilities, and Technology Committee. As chair, I'll be especially interested in working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help create good jobs, increase our energy independence and increase rural broadband access.
Due to our powerful potential for solar, wind, tidal, efficiency and other forms of clean energy, as well as strong and increasing demand for renewable energy from our neighbors to the south, Maine is in a strong position to create more good jobs for Maine workers. To replace the good manufacturing and mill jobs we've lost in recent years, we need to seize every one of these opportunities.
Another opportunity is high-speed internet. Broadband penetration today is a fundamental economic and educational gatekeeper -- and at present, ours is ranked 49th among the 50 states. Far too many Maine businesses cannot access important markets. Far too many Maine children cannot access powerful new online learning tools. Just as we once invested in rural electrification or in interstate highways, today we must boost our investments in rural broadband.
Our economy and our children are waiting. It's time we get to work on the future we all want, and the opportunities we all have.
Rep. Seth Berry

Democrats will fight for rural Maine
This year, I will join my colleagues embarking on a new legislative session and my first as House majority leader. I ran for office because I had seen too many friends, family and former Belfast High School classmates leave the state to seek better jobs and better opportunities for their growing families. It shouldn't be that way.
We all see that our world is developing rapidly. The rise of technology, trade and Maine's ever changing economy will continue to challenge us. Too many Mainers and too many rural Maine towns have been left behind by these changes. That is unacceptable.
It's time we started meeting those challenges head on by knocking down the barriers that block success for rural Maine, so we can keep our best and brightest right here at home.
My priority for this legislative session is empowering rural communities to build independent, long-lasting infrastructure that will bring back some of the Maine families we've lost.
I am proud of my Waldo County roots and the community that raised me. That's a way of living worth fighting for. That's a fight Democrats are going to lead. Over the next two years, Mainers are going to know that it is the Democratic Party that fights for them.

Measuring snow isn't so easy

Texto completo: By the time you read this, the first heavy storm of the winter will be on its way out to sea and you will have one question on your mind: How much snow did I get?

I hate to break it to you, but if by “how much” you mean “how deep,” nobody really knows for sure.
Measuring depth of snowfall is the hardest thing weather observers do. Wind blows snow around, piling it into mounds or scouring it away. Trees grab snow from the air and hold it, then let go all at once. And small changes in temperature or humidity can alter flakes' size after they fall: waiting a couple hours to measure the storm can lower the depth on the ground.
So where and when should you make a measurement to find the “real” depth of snow? In my yard, that depth can change by 6 inches within a few yards, and it's not obvious which, if any, of these accurately reflects what happened during a snowstorm.
If you're bragging/complaining to relatives in Florida, just measure in the deepest spot you can find. But if you want a meteorologically absolute number, there's no easy answer. (Yes, those town-by-town numbers on TV should be taken with a grain of white stuff.)
Weather observers have developed a system that at least produces relatively consistent results. It involves something called a snowboard, which isn't what The Flying Tomato thinks it is.
“An observer will have a flat board, maybe a foot by 3 – that's what they measure on. An official observer, every six hours – they take snowfall, clean the board off, then take the measurement again in six hours,” said James Brown, a hydrometeorological technician with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, the office that covers most of New Hampshire. The snowboard should be white, to minimize the chance that any after-storm sunshine will heat it up and cause excess settling.
There are a handful of official observers for this NWS office, including one in Concord. They get official equipment, including rain gauge and training. The office also has about 100 cooperative observers through New Hampshire and Maine, many associated with a crowd-sourced program called CoCoRaHS, which asks people to measure rain, hail and snow totals every morning.
I have been one of those CoCoRaHS people for years, an experience that has led me to regard snowfall depths as estimates rather than exact measurements, because placement of the snowboard makes all the difference.
“It's supposed to be twice the distance from the highest object, but that's hard to do in New England. We have a lot of trees,” Brown said.
Indeed. My snowboard should be 100 feet from the nearest 50-foot maple, but I don't have that much open space in my property. And if I owned a big open hayfield and tromped into the middle of it every morning to take my measurement, I'd face a different problem.
“If it's in the middle of the field and you get the wind blowing, and it blows everything off the snowboard,” said Brown. Not good.
The best situation, he said, is to put the snowboard near – but not too near – a stand of deciduous trees. In winter they've lost their leaves, so they don't hold back large amounts of snow, but they do slow the wind.
That doesn't sound terribly exact, does it?
“It's a difficult thing. You have to use your head about it,” Brown said.
In other words, snow depth observers look around their property and try to judge whether the snowboard location appears typical. That's what I do, although I'll admit there are times when it feels like I'm measuring a non typical spot.
(As a side note, I have discovered one thing over the years: People consistently over estimate how much snow fell in their property. Nobody, it seems, wants to have to have the smallest total on their block.)
The real problem with snow depth is that it doesn't measure what happened – the volume of precipitation that fell. It only measures a secondary characteristic: The volume occupied by this precipitation at a certain moment under changing circumstances.
They aren't the same thing, and we all know by experience.
Compare 2 feet of light, fluffy snow that you can push off the walkway with a broom, versus 6 inches of heavy, hard-to-shovel snow that has chiropractors rubbing their hands in anticipation of more customers. The former is reported as being a lot more more snow but we know it isn't really “more” – especially if we're worried about our roof caving in. The meteorological way around this problem is to use “snow-water equivalent” a measure how much water is contained in the snow.
It's simple. Collect a column of the snowfall in a calibrated receptacle – usually a foot-tall rain gauge that is 4 inches in diameter – and melt it down, reporting the result as if it had been rain.
When you do this, you find that the ratio between the depth of snow and the depth of melted water varies enormously. It can be as low as 3-to-1 (which would be brutally heavy snow, indeed) and as high as 15-to-1 (which would blow away if you sneezed).
Even more confusing, a warm day will turn one morning's 15-to-1 ratio into tomorrow's 3-to-1 ratio.
And you'll notice that the snow-water equivalent still faces the location problem. I gather the snow off my snowboard to melt it, but if my board doesn't provide an accurate reflection of what fell in my yard, this water figure will also be inaccurate.
There is a serious side to this question, too: Dealing with drought. Snowmelt is a contributor to New England's water table, so it behooves planners to know how much water exists in the snow that will cover the North Country in early spring. Taking snow-water measurements all throughout Coos County is easier said than done, however.
Out west, where snowmelt is far more important to water supplies, a system called Snowtel is often used. It involves “pressure pillows” on the ground, which measure the weight of a given area of snow atop them and thus its water equivalent, and sends the data out automatically via satellite. But those systems are expensive and still suffer from the problem that you have to choose one spot to measure and estimate what it tells about all the surrounding area.
When all is said and done, lots of estimates over large distances will give you a decent idea of what happened, and lots of snow-water-equivalent measurements will probably even out the errors and provide an accurate picture on a country wide basis.
As for answering the question “exactly how much snow fell in my yard?” – relax. It's virtually impossible to say precisely, so put the yardstick somewhere obvious and consider the result a intelligent estimate. Then go play in the snow, because that's the best way to judge how big this storm was.

Texto completo:   In his commentary on the Electoral College, Randy Lynch asserts that the Electoral College is undemocratic and that it's good, because it protects the minority from the "tyranny of majority rule." In every state, except for Maine and Nebraska, the electors of the college are selected by a winner-take-all procedure. No matter how close or lopsided the presidential vote, all of the state's electors are selected by the statewide winner's party.
This process of one-party rule will never result in national coalition government. On election day, 46 percent of Americans voted for Donald Trump. Because of the count of state electors, he will decide domestic and foreign policy for 100 percent of Americans. How can the Constitution protect the majority from the tyranny of minority rule?
In the election of 1800, only 40 percent of all white men owned enough land to qualify to vote; zero percent of everybody else qualified. I've had a hard time finding a Founding Father who supported universal suffrage. Perhaps Benjamin Franklin would have voted for my suffrage despite my land-poor status.
But the Founding Fathers let their American children correct their undemocratic thinking, by providing for amendments to the Constitution. In 1869, Americans passed the 15th Amendment allowing men who were former black slaves to vote. In 1919, the 19th Amendment allowed black and white women to vote, and in 1971 Americans passed the 26th Amendment giving the right to vote to 18-year-olds, many of whom who were already exercising their right to fight and die for America.
The Electoral College is a bad idea because it is undemocratic and it is not un-American to think about changing it.

Deming residents need access to Gila meetings
As a Deming resident, I am very concerned about the Gila River diversion project and would like to attend the CAP meetings. Unfortunately, the meetings are usually held in Silver City at times that are not good for people who work. I think it is important for Deming residents to have better access to these meetings, as Deming is the largest community with CAP representation, and so should have knowledge of what board members are planning to do. A lot of money is at stake, as well as the future of water in southern New Mexico.

Texto completo:   WESTBROOK, Maine -- Yassin Saker didn't meet his youngest daughter until her first birthday. They were outside a terminal at Boston's Logan Airport on Nov. 1 and the little girl took in her father with a long, uncertain gaze, Saker recalled.
"I knew she didn't know me," he said.
The child was born in Syria while her father was slicing deli meat at a Maine supermarket to raise money to get his family away from the brutal civil war that had overrun their home in Damascus.
Their first meeting marked the end of a years-long struggle to escape the war that destroyed their home and put an ocean between Saker and his family -- a plight he first shared with the Bangor Daily News in December 2015.
Saker, 60, emigrated to the United States from Syria in 1978. A gifted student, he came to study medicine in New Hampshire, but when the cost of medical school overwhelmed his family, he changed tracks and transferred to University of Maine at Presque Isle, where he'd won a scholarship.
By the time he graduated with a math degree in 1986, Saker had fallen in love with Maine, he said. Nine years later, he became an American citizen. He eventually got a job teaching math at Portland Arts and Technology High School. During summer breaks, Saker would return to Syria to visit his family. That's when he fell in love again, this time with a woman: Fadia al Shibbli.
They were married in 2003 and planned to return to Maine together. But things went awry two years later when Saker's father fell ill. Saker moved back to the Damascus suburbs to care for his parents. He and his wife had their first daughter, Raneem, in 2006, and son Mustafa three years later. Still planning to eventually return to Portland, Saker made sure that each of his children obtained the documents securing their American citizenship. But things went wrong again in 2012, while al Shibbli, now 38, was pregnant with their third child.
"Then the bad times came," Saker recalled.
As fighting between the forces of Syrian President Bashar al Assad and anti-government rebels mounted, bombs began falling in the Damascus suburbs. Like millions of other Syrians, the Saker family fled.
They sought safety in the government-held core of Damascus, but within a couple years, they were struggling to pay rent in the two-bedroom apartment that was shared with a dozen other people. The crush of refugees into the city had spiked rents by more than 500 percent and there was little work to be found, Saker said.
"We had no hope, no hope at all," he recalled. "When we moved we lost everything."
The family began looking for ways to return to the United States. As citizens, that would have been possible for Saker and his children alone. But al Shibbli needed a guarantee from an American sponsor who could provide financial support, and Saker did not have enough money.
By March 2015, they had already sold al Shibbli's jewelry for rent money, but Saker didn't want to leave his wife and children in a war zone. It was al Shibbli who eventually convinced him to return to the United States in the hope of finding work and bringing his family along after, the couple recalled.
Through begging and borrowing Saker rounded up the money to buy a plane ticket, he said. But just before he left, al Shibbli brought him news they weren't expecting: She was pregnant.
"We were not planning for it," said Saker. "Life was so difficult, and we had no money and, you know -- war time."
Jena was born on Nov. 1, 2015, after her father left. Al Shibbli recalled the world that her youngest daughter arrived into as terrifying. Outside Damascus, fighting between the government, the rebels, Islamic State and various militias was ferocious. Inside the city there were kidnappings, and government forces would raid people's homes looking for rebels or those suspected of supporting them, she said, speaking through her husband's translation.
"It was fear all the time," she said. "There was no safe place."
Saker arrived in the U.S. in late March 2015 with $300 and began frantically looking for a job, he said. He found a part-time position at the deli counter of the North Yarmouth Hannaford and took to work with the motivation of the desperate.
"I had three kids and a fourth one on the way," he said. "I was working so hard, and when you work hard anywhere in the world, but especially in the United States, they reward you."
At Hannaford, Saker moved quickly to a full-time position and then received a promotion to deli supervisor in Portland. But he was struggling to save while also sending money back to feed and house his family. And they were once again stymied by the intricacies of the immigration system. Now that Saker was in the United States, if he sponsored his wife, he'd need to sponsor each of their children, too, he recalled.
The reward for the Saker family came in the form of help. Over the last year, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project and Rep. Chellie Pingree's office helped them navigate the immigration process and arranged for Saker's American cousin to sponsor al Shibbli.
Finally this fall, after four risky trips from Damascus to Lebanon, al Shibbli heard from the American consulate in Beirut that she would be able to come to Maine.
For her first birthday Jena got a plane ticket, and 14 hours later, she was looking hesitantly into the dark eyes and soft face of a man she'd never met.
"I knew she didn't know me," said Saker. "But I knew she would know me."

Nor'easter blankets Maine, collapses UMaine's Mahaney Dome

Resumen: The Mahaney Dome, an 8,000-square-foot structure erected in 2006 adjacent to UMaine's field house, buckled under the weight of the snow that fell Thursday night, Will Biberstein, UMaine's senior associate athletic director for internal operations, said Friday.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- The heavy, wet snow that fell Thursday night made for great snowballs, but it also caused damage and travel problems all over the state, some parts of which saw up to 2 feet. The snow knocked out power to more than 100,000 residents, brought down utility lines and even caused the University of Maine's Mahaney Dome to collapse.
But the snowfall for 2016 isn't over yet, as a fast-moving storm system is forecast to pass through the state as revelers prepare to welcome in the new year on Saturday.
"We have an 'Alberta clipper' that is heading our way," meteorologist Priscilla Farrar of the National Weather Service in Caribou said Friday. "It's going to bring snow to the area late Saturday. On New Year's Eve night, it's going to be snowing down there [in downtown Bangor]."
Bangor should get 3 to 5 inches of snow between Saturday night and Sunday morning, but only 2 to 4 inches are predicted in Down East areas and 1 to 3 inches are expected to fall up north in Aroostook County, Farrar said.
The low-pressure system heading toward Maine formed in Alberta in western Canada and is expected to cause temperatures to plunge, the meteorologist said.
"It looks like on New Year's Eve night it's going to be in the mid-20s, which is 5 to 10 degrees lower than normal for the Bangor area," she said.
Mainers were busy Friday digging out from the Thursday night storm, but officials at UMaine had an even bigger headache to deal with than a plowed-in driveway.
The Mahaney Dome, an 8,000-square-foot structure erected in 2006 adjacent to UMaine's field house, buckled under the weight of the snow that fell Thursday night, Will Biberstein, UMaine's senior associate athletic director for internal operations, said Friday.
"It's fortunate that it happened in the middle of the night and there was nobody in the dome at the time," he said of the multipurpose dome, which includes FieldTurf artificial grass and is the indoor practice home for several Black Bear sports teams. "It's kind of a slow season before everybody returns from winter break, so hopefully we can make our assessments and try to move forward as soon as possible."
Biberstein said it was not clear when the dome will return to operation.
"We're currently in the evaluation process," he said. "We'll turn to that and see what the next steps are going to be."
Biberstein said he could not say whether the dome would be ready in time for UMaine's baseball and softball teams to kick off preseason practices.
"We haven't figured that out," he said.
The Mahaney Dome was made possible by a $1 million donation from Kevin Mahaney on behalf of his father, the late Larry Mahaney, a longtime benefactor of UMaine athletics.
A January 2007 winter storm also brought down the air-supported indoor practice facility, temporarily closing it when a large tear developed in the building's fabric covering after substantial snowfall and heavy rains blanketed the area.
The combination of warm ocean air clashing with arctic cold from the north and west created the "first strong nor'easter New England has seen this season," according to Todd Foisy, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Caribou.
Much of Maine received double-digit snowfall, the National Weather Service said, with Oxford County in southern Maine reporting 27 inches in some locations.
There were reports in the Portland area of thundersnow, a rare meteorological event in which thunder and lightning accompany a snowstorm.
As Mainers awoke Friday, more than 100,000 discovered they were without power. Central Maine Power listed about 91,000 outages early Friday, and Emera Maine had an estimated 22,492 customers without power as of 9 a.m. Friday.
"Penobscot and Hancock counties have been hardest hit overnight, with additional customers out in Washington County," an Emera press release stated. "The combination of wet snow, sleet and strong, gusty winds has brought trees and tree limbs down onto electrical lines."
Emera Maine's Storm Response Team had been preparing for the storm for several days.
CMP brought in crews from other states and Canada to work on restoring power and by 4:30 p.m. Friday had reconnected about half of its customers. Restoring power to everyone could take several days in some areas, officials said.
Bangor Public Works had to delay plowing on Kenduskeag Avenue and Center Street because of downed lines, but otherwise, snowplow crews were able to keep the roadways clear, director Dana Wardwell said Friday morning.
"This is Maine," he said.
In eastern coastal Maine, the storm was primarily a wind event, with precipitation limited to mostly rain and about an inch of snow.
Despite the shoveling required, some outdoor enthusiasts were excited about the snow.
"WOW! What a way to start the season!" the Maine Snowmobile Association, which described the storm as a "whopper," said on its Facebook page.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- One of the first items of business for the new Maine Legislature when lawmakers return to Augusta on Wednesday is a joint committee hearing on a proposed psychiatric treatment unit.
But Gov. Paul LePage said his administration has abandoned plans to build the unit in Augusta, making the scheduled hearing unnecessary.
T he struggle between the LePage administration and lawmakers, primarily Democratic legislative leaders, over a new, 22-bed mental health facility to house forensic patients or those deemed not guilty of criminal acts because of a mental illness or unfit for trial has simmered for months. The administration has identified funding for the building, which will cost between $3 million and $5 million.
Everyone agrees that a new facility is needed to regain federal certification at Riverview Psychiatric Center, but its location and how it will be run and overseen remain causes of conflict within the State House.
The governor originally wanted to build the new facility next to Riverview in Augusta, but the plan was blocked twice by Democratic legislative leaders who wanted more information about it. LePage now says he's putting it on state-owned land in Bangor.
On Thursday, the Legislature announced that its Appropriations and Financial Affairs and Health and Human Services committees will hold a joint hearing on the originally proposed Augusta facility on Jan. 5 -- a day after lawmakers return in earnest for the 2017 session.
Senate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, and House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, requested the hearing to ask the committees to report back with recommendations to the Legislative Council, the panel of 10 legislative leaders that must approve new construction on the Capitol complex in Augusta.
But LePage called the Bangor location "a done deal" on WLOB on Wednesday, saying his administration won't be participating in any legislative hearing on the matter.
"They can have the meeting, but the executive branch will not be present. It's over," he said. "We're done. We're moving on. We're not reopening this."
That doesn't bode well for the committee members who want new information. But Rep. Patricia Hymanson, D-York, the health committee's new House chairwoman, said the hearing is still worth having and that LePage "has been known to change his thinking from minute to minute and day to day."
"Maine people deserve to have a lot of questions asked about this facility and we are up to the task of asking these questions," she said.

Resumen: National Weather Service officials said they couldn't guarantee the realization of Meyers' hopes, but Maine's 282 snowmobile clubs -- the backbone of a snowmobile industry that draws revenues of $300 million to $350 million to the state annually -- are off to a good start with the snow that's fallen and with its timing. According to the weather service office in Caribou, as of Dec. 22, 49.2 inches of snow had fallen so far this winter in Caribou.

Texto completo:   CARIBOU, Maine -- Three days before Christmas, Gary Marquis was grooming a snowmobile trail. The superintendent of the Caribou Parks and Recreation Department was just outside town filling a mudhole on Interconnected Trail System 90 near Woodland.
"We've got almost three feet of snow on the ground and the ground never had a chance to freeze with all the snow that has fallen so far. That's what the clubs are fighting right now," Marquis said on Dec. 22. "Anything in the swamps is very hard to get through right now. [Snowmobile riders] have to be very careful."
Not that Marquis was complaining. He said he and other Aroostook County snowmobilers were experiencing what Maine Snowmobile Association Executive Director Bob Meyers was hoping the rest of Maine would soon see -- a good old-fashioned winter. That means temperatures of zero to 20 degrees Fahrenheit and deep, powdery snow that melts little until springtime.
"It means cold the way we remember. It means a lot of snow and having it stay. That's the thing. When you get a great snowstorm and then it's 45 degrees and raining, it's sad," Meyers said. "Last year it never got cold, we never got much snow. There was nothing there."
National Weather Service officials said they couldn't guarantee the realization of Meyers' hopes, but Maine's 282 snowmobile clubs -- the backbone of a snowmobile industry that draws revenues of $300 million to $350 million to the state annually -- are off to a good start with the snow that's fallen and with its timing.
"To have groomed trails since two weeks ago is very rare. That is the old-style winters we used to have and to have those kinds of snow on the ground is very good," Marquis said. "It means we could have a very good season."
According to the weather service office in Caribou, as of Dec. 22, 49.2 inches of snow had fallen so far this winter in Caribou. That's about 16.6 inches above normal. Last year at this time, only 16.3 inches had fallen in Caribou, a good indication of how abysmal the season was, said Tim Duda, a meteorologist with the Caribou office.
"We are well ahead of where we were last year at this time," Duda said prior to the late December storm.
Perhaps most revealingly, the snowpack -- the amount of snow remaining on the ground after storms -- was about 18 inches in Caribou, and 15 to 20 inches across Aroostook on Dec. 22, said Rich Norton, meteorologist at the weather service in Caribou. Fort Kent had a 12-inch snowpack and Van Buren had 13 inches.
"The best snowmobiling is obviously in Aroostook County right now," Norton said.
The hard reality for snowmobilers in the last few decades has been that winter doesn't really get going in Maine until Jan. 1 or later, and a real winter for snowmobilers is typically the kind that buries Bangor or the Maine coast in snow as well as Aroostook County.
The last good season for snowmobiling statewide, the winter of 2014-15, featured a February 2015 that was among the coldest on record.
Duda said the weather service hadn't any predictions for the amounts of snowfall expected this month or in February. So for now, snowmobilers, particularly those in Caribou, were happy to get on the trails while the snow was still there.
Snowmobiler Paul Henry Lessard of St. Francis said he had already put 500 miles on his new sled in just the past two weeks.
"There's not much room for improvement," Lessard said recently of trail conditions in the St. John Valley.
The New Hampshire native who now lives in St. Francis was in Fort Kent to pick up a new "Bigfoot" decal at Precision Printing and Design, which will go on his Arctic Cat sled. An avid snowmobiler, Lessard said he has ridden every winter since 1971, including many trips from Pittsburg, New Hampshire, all the way to Fort Kent.
Bob Plourde, owner of the snowmobile dealer Plourde & Plourde in Caribou and Madawaska, said people seem to be looking forward to good snowmobiling this winter.
"The main conversation last year was that we had no snow, and that it came very late," Plourde said, "but the people are very happy this year."
Meyers said the state's snowmobile trails would be impossible to maintain without the efforts of the volunteers who belong to the association's clubs -- plus 2,200 businesses that are also MSA members. The volunteers groom the state's 14,500 miles of Interconnected Trail System trails and lesser arteries. Their efforts receive about $4 million in state grants generated annually by snowmobile registry fees and a small percentage of state gas tax funds, Meyers said.
All snowmobilers, Meyers said, "should always be mindful that 95 percent of our trails are on private land. They should be respectful of that. When we have the weather, the clubs do a remarkable job doing beautiful trails."
The clubs' efforts support most all forms of Maine businesses, Meyers said, and are very well-known. His office in Augusta receives calls regularly from around North America from tourists looking to come to Maine to ride.
"I had a man from West Virginia call and Christmas morning he and his wife are hooking up the trailer and heading to Maine to go snowmobiling for a week. That's a serious commitment and it speaks volumes to the quality of the trails we offer," he said.

Texto completo:   BELFAST, Maine -- Heightened demand for affordable places to live, sluggish housing development and an increase in recent years of seasonal and short-term rentals have combined to create to an apartment crunch along much of the Maine coast.
Recognizing the shortage, midcoast communities are looking for ways to convince more property owners and developers to bring new apartments and ease the strain.
"We're all in the same boat," Audra Caler-Bell, Rockland's community development director and acting city manager, said. "There's an increasing shortage of affordable housing, and that extends into workforce housing. We're talking about people who are gainfully employed -- teachers, shipyard workers -- who are struggling to find and afford a decent place to live."
When an apartment comes up for rent in the $600 to $900 range -- what generally is considered an "affordable" rate -- the response is frenzied. Landlords field dozens of calls, set up multiple walkthroughs and take their pick of tenant, often in the span of just a few days.
Those who miss out either get in line for the next one or settle for a less-than-ideal living situation. It's a game that's becoming all too familiar to current and hopeful renters in Belfast, Rockport, Camden, Rockland and elsewhere along the coast.
Kate Pendleton has settled into her new apartment, a nicely renovated one-bedroom unit in Belfast built above a converted two-bay garage next to her landlord's home. It was a fight to get it but at $725 per month, heat included, it was a steal compared to others she'd seen.
"This was the first time I'd ever looked for a place in town -- normally I'm out in the boonies," the 21-year-old said during an interview at her apartment, a Charlie Brown-style Christmas tree perched in a nearby corner.
When her lease ended on her former apartment in Jackson, Pendleton decided she wanted to move closer to Belfast, where she works at the athenahealth call center -- the city's largest employer. After more than a month of searching, she ran out of time and had to move home temporarily with her mother, resulting in a 45-minute commute.
She said she wasn't confident her wages -- about $15 per hour -- would allow her to comfortably afford the rents she was seeing during her lengthy apartment search. Rent ranged from $800 to over $1,000, and heating costs often weren't included. Apartments that were affordable were in rough shape, she said.
Her search continued for two more months, until she heard a co-worker was eyeing a place a few miles from downtown. More than a dozen others had lined up to look at it. Pendleton got together a stack of papers including references, a resume, financial information, set up a meeting with the landlord and swept in to snatch the place up.
"I was sure that if I didn't grab this one, another nice, affordable place might not come up for months," Pendleton said, adding that she's still on good terms with her co-worker. "The competitiveness of trying to find an apartment is one of the most stressful factors. It's like a battle of the fittest."
Pendleton isn't alone in her struggles. Other friends of hers are in the midst of monthslong searches for places in the midcoast. Some are living with relatives while others have moved into apartments they can't afford long term or run-down places with lower rents.
Jason Doppelt, 31, first moved to Maine from Kansas City there years ago. Back home, he rented a small studio apartment near the heart of the city for just $450 per month, complete with air conditioning and onsite laundry. He was easily able to afford it with wages he earned as a cook.
Three summers ago, he visited Maine in his travel trailer and fell in love, but he struggled to find year-round work as a chef and struggled even harder to find a place that cost roughly the same as what he had in Kansas City.
"I thought I could find something comparable," he said. "Well, it didn't work out that way."
After living in his travel trailer for a summer, he went back to Missouri for the winter with his "tail tucked between his legs." The next summer, he returned, living in a van during the warmest stretch of the year so he could afford rent at a friend's cabin for the winter.
"Just coming up with first and last month's rent for some of these places is incredibly tough, let alone keeping up with monthly rent and heat bills," Doppelt said.
This year, he's more settled, living in the basement of a house that he rents along with three friends, though he'd rather have his own place. But by settling for a basement room and living with roommates, he's able to have a roof over his head year-round for just $300 per month.
When he first moved to Maine, he earned minimum wage in a kitchen job, bringing in about $250 per week. He made a little more cooking on schooners in the summer. Now, as a mechanic, he's bringing in $450 per week. He says the wages in area just aren't enough to support the types of rental prices he saw.
"I really like Maine, and I really want to stay here," he said. "I want the midcoast to be my home, and I just have to find a way to make it work."
In demand
Caler-Bell said this is a problem more municipal leaders along the midcoast are recognizing and starting to grapple with.
Caler-Bell said Rockland started looking at the issue after several local employers, notably Fisher Engineering, reported that employees were struggling to find decent places to rent in the area so they could start work. Some resorted to living out of their cars or commuting long distances, Caler-Bell said. Fisher officials declined to comment for this story.
"Pickings are slim. You're paying a premium sometimes for housing that might not meet your needs," Caler-Bell said.
Apartment unit prices in Waldo and Knox counties have long outpaced the earnings of many people who call the area home, according to annual reports from the Maine Housing Authority.
In Belfast, the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment in 2015 (the most recent report available) was $831 including utilities, according to Maine Housing. To afford that rent comfortably, a person should be making about $33,232, but the median income in Belfast is $23,689.
In Rockland, the average rent is higher -- $1,007 per month -- which a renter would need to earn $40,260 per year to afford, according to the housing agency. The median income among Rockland renters, however, is just over $30,000. Camden's average two-bedroom rental runs around $925 per month. The median renter earns about $35,700, which is closer to the $37,000 income recommended to afford that rent.
Midcoast communities have become more of a draw in recent years, with a revival of downtowns and new industries popping up across Belfast, Rockland and Camden.
"We're seeing an influx of new people, and we want more of these folks to be able to call Belfast home," Wayne Marshall, Belfast's city planner, said. Unfortunately, many are having to settle outside town or in rental situations that are less than ideal.
Marshall has been working for the city for 18 years, but in all that time he said he hasn't seen a single market-rate, multifamily housing structure go up. Years ago, MBNA built a 46-unit housing complex off Crocker Road so its employees would have places to live. After that center closed about a decade ago, the apartments were sold and converted into condominiums.
Why the shortage?
Bennett Bricker, a Camden-based real estate broker, believes a big contributor is the fact that people in their 20s and 30s can't afford to buy homes like they used to. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, many lenders wouldn't giving out mortgages unless the person had 20 percent down available before signing on to a mortgage.
"Many younger professionals don't have $6,000 to $8,000 in the bank to make that first payment on a house anymore," Bricker said.
In addition, some older homeowners are downsizing, selling their homes in favor of renting smaller properties.
"That creates much more demand than we've ever had," Bricker said, and contributes to a frantic rental market, in which hopeful renters are climbing over one another to secure apartments.
It also stems from the number of people who only live in these towns for part of the year. If you're looking to live in Belfast, for example, there are dozens of properties ranging from downtown lofts to entire furnished homes up for rent during winter months while the owners are away. But come spring, you have to search for another place, and competition among prospective renters gets intense.
Some property owners are repurposing former apartment units, rooms and rental homes, taking them off year-round listings and advertising them as weekly summer rentals, often using internet-based services such as Airbnb.
This causes concern for town officials, who worry that if the practices continue, some parts of town could become largely abandoned for chunks of the year.
"We don't want Belfast to go dark," Marshall said. "It's critical that Belfast remains what it always has been -- a community that has a wide range of people living and working here."
Bricker said municipal policies also have played a role. Local zoning ordinances setting minimum lot sizes for multiunit housing has been a significant impediment to potential apartment developments in communities across the state, Bricker argued.
If an apartment developer can't fit enough units on a lot to make the project economically feasible, they're not going to move forward with a construction or redevelopment effort, he said.
"Some towns are starting to realize this is holding things back and making the rental situation more difficult," Bricker said.
Encouraging expansion
Rockland has been focusing on finding solutions to the shortage. The city council is considering a series of sweeping zoning ordinance changes to encourage people to develop more units close to town.
The overhaul would reduce minimum lot size requirements, allow small secondary units (such as an above-garage apartment or guest house) on lots and reduce setbacks and road frontage requirements.
However, some in the community have said the changes would lead to the construction of small out-buildings between homes, causing some neighborhoods to become congested and changing the feel and aesthetics of others. Others worry that these new units will only lead to more short-term rentals that might not be made available to hopeful residents.
Caler-Bell said the city has been trying to tailor existing programs to help people with housing projects, making about $25,000 available for renovation and weatherization efforts through its housing rehabilitation assistance program. Traditionally this is targeted toward multifamily housing, but the city is seeking potential first-time homebuyers who want to purchase and fix up a place.
In Belfast, Marshall and the city's planning board are vetting possible solutions as well and plan on bringing a detailed proposal to the city council in coming months. Among the changes they're considering is allowing property owners in certain parts of the city to convert existing single-family homes or duplexes into multifamily units. Marshall said the city hopes to continue to find ways to encourage new market-rate housing construction.
A few years ago, Belfast changed its zoning ordinances to allow people to build apartments in detached structures, such as above-garage apartments. Around the same time, the city decreased the minimum lot size required to have a duplex.
Caler-Bell said communities should start taking a broader, regional look at the issue across the midcoast. She said the Midcoast Economic Development District, a group of which she is a member, recently began discussing the rental shortage as a concern and could begin looking at fixes. For example, it could be easier for a regional group such as this to secure the necessary funding to launch residential development projects that would put a dent in the problem.
Still, she said, it's vital that towns continue to find ways to encourage private citizens to develop apartments on their own.
"Otherwise, our communities could fall victim to their own growth," Caler-Bell said.

Texto completo:   Phil Gouzie remembers the afternoon he came home from high school football practice and learned his father had lost his job. It was 1938, and Gouzie was 16 years old.
"I could hear my mother crying in the other room," Gouzie, who is now 94 and lives in South Portland, recalled. "She was a really tough woman. She was raising eight children during the [Great] Depression. She never cried."
Listening through the wall, he learned the reason for his mother's distress. Gouzie's father, whose job in the dye room at the Haskell Silk Mill in Westbrook kept his large, French-Catholic family fed and clothed during the earlier years of the Great Depression, had come home at midday with the bad news.
"The mill is closing. He's lost his job. There's no chance of getting another job. And there's eight children in the house," Gouzie said, counting off the points on his fingertips. Although he was the youngest of the eight, he knew he had to act.
"I had a friend who had gone into the Civilian Conservation Corps," he said. "He told me, 'They give you $5 a month to spend, they feed you, they give you clothes and they send $25 a month home to your family.' So I left Westbrook High School in my sophomore year, and I joined the CCC."
Countering poverty and shame
The CCC was a federal work-relief program launched in 1933, one of several programs known collectively as the New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's farsighted response to the national shame and despair of the Great Depression.
From 1933 through 1942, the CCC provided government-paid public works jobs to about 3 million young men in all 50 states -- including Hawaii and Alaska, which were U.S. territories at the time -- as well as in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Most projects were aimed at developing and conserving the nation's parks and forests. In addition to earning room, board, clothing and a solid monthly paycheck, the "CCC boys" were trained in practical trades such as construction, excavation, masonry, surveying and radio transmission. They were encouraged to finish their high school diplomas using onsite teachers and classrooms. They learned independence, teamwork and leadership skills that stood them in good stead throughout their adult lives.
In Maine, 28 CCC camps were established, primarily in the heavily forested northern and western counties. But the CCC was active in many other areas of the state as well, including two camps on Mount Desert Island. In addition to forestry projects, the CCC boys on MDI built the Blackwoods and Seawall campgrounds in Acadia National Park, the day-use picnic area at Pretty Marsh and miles and miles of the park's iconic trails and footpaths.
About 16,700 young men from Maine worked at CCC camps in Maine, along with more than 1,600 supervisors and staff. An additional 1,136 enrollees from other states served in Maine camps. The families of these men received a total of about $4 million over the life of the program.
'We ate very well'
The CCC was originally open to unemployed, unmarried young men ages 18 to 25. Later, it expanded to include men from ages 17 to 28. Phil Gouzie was 16 when he joined.
"I went down to City Hall to sign up," he said. "They all knew I was only 16. But they knew me, and they knew my father. They knew we had eight children and that my dad had lost his job. They just waved me through."
Many underage Maine boys entered the program under similar circumstances, he said.
Gouzie reported to Fort Williams in South Portland for his induction physical and basic training before being assigned to a CCC camp in Bridgton. It wasn't far from his family's home in Westbrook, but he didn't have the time or transportation to see them often. Buried in deep woods, the camp consisted of four large barracks, a mess hall and some outbuildings. About 200 CCC boys lived and worked there, Gouzie said, along with supervisors from the Maine Forest Service, assigned to protect the valuable forest resource from insect damage.
"We were saving the trees from gypsy moths," Gouzie said. "We would take a can of creosote and paint the egg casings. That would kill the moths."
As a "spotter," Gouzie stayed on the ground and directed a creosote-wielding coworker high up in the branches. The teams of boys and young men covered large parcels of forested land, marking the areas they already treated to make sure they didn't miss any.
In the evenings, they returned to camp for a hot meal and a solid night's sleep before beginning all over the next day. It was hard, dirty work, Gouzie said, but the food was good and plentiful. "We ate very well," he said.
For many of the boys at the camp, the CCC provided the best meals they had ever eaten. One boy he became friends with weighed less than 100 pounds when they met, Gouzie said, but gained about 30 pounds over the months they worked together.
Proud service
Gouzie lived and worked at the Bridgton camp for two years. By then, the national economy was emerging from its long crisis, and he was offered a job at a Portland meat-packing plant. From there, with World War II looming, he worked transporting troops to Fort McKinley on Great Diamond Island in Casco Bay for training.
Before the United States entered the war, Gouzie joined the U.S. Navy himself and was assigned to the submarine tender USS Proteus. He rose to the level of Mortar Machinist Mate, 2nd Class and served at Pearl Harbor, Midway and Guam during the war. He was on board and on deck in Tokyo Bay on Sept. 2, 1945, when Japan formally surrendered to the U.S. and its allies.
After WWII ended, Gouzie met and married his wife, Grace. He ran as a Democrat for the Maine House in 1948, losing the district to his Republican competitor but proudly carrying his home town of Westbrook. He and Grace bought the cozy bungalow where he still lives now and raised one daughter, who lives nearby. He took a job delivering bottled gas to homes and businesses in the Portland area, retiring in his late 60s. Grace died in 2012. Gouzie cared for her at home until the end.
But despite important life events and the passage of time, Gouzie has never lost touch with his CCC roots. Until quite recently, he met other former CCC boys in the Portland area monthly for breakfast. Now, he says, their ranks are fewer and most are getting too old to drive -- though he still does.
He speaks about the CCC to Rotary and other local groups, trying to keep history alive for future generations. Participating in meetings via his iPad, he serves on the board of CCC Legacy, a national organization dedicated to documenting and preserving the program's impact on American culture.
Back in 2013, Gouzie and two other CCC boys from Maine were honored at a celebration in recognition of the program's 80th anniversary, receiving the President's Call to Service Award and a congratulatory letter from the White House, signed by President Barack Obama.
But Phil Gouzie is most proud of a very tangible and enduring symbol of the program's impact in Maine. In 1999, the Maine Legislature voted to establish a CCC memorial in Augusta, including a bronze statue on the grounds of the Capitol and a public repository for photographs, personal stories and other related information to be maintained at the State Archives. Gouzie worked closely with then-Rep. Robert Duplessis of Westbrook to draft the language of the bill, which included a $10,000 budget appropriation, and supported its unanimous passage at the State House. He also engaged in additional fundraising for a total of $18,000 to fully cover the cost of purchasing, installing and dedicating the statue, which stands on the Capitol grounds.
Gouzie said it's important that the lessons of the Civilian Conservation Corps not be lost as the CCC generation ages. For him, those lessons are twofold: "If you don't take care of your natural resources, you'll lose them," he said. "What the CCC did was vital to keeping the forests growing and the rivers running."
Even more essential was President Roosevelt's wisdom in establishing the program in the first place. "Congress had the money; they didn't want to spend it because they thought the country would go bankrupt," he said. "But FDR knew that if we didn't give the people jobs, we wouldn't have a country at all."

I am currently harboring secret fantasies of hiding away to a cabin in Maine (Maine is nice, right?) and spending 2017 under a chunky-knit blanket with a good book. Even if hiding in a cabin won't actually prevent 2017 from happening, at least I can enjoy plenty of great literature from my tiny apartment in Manhattan.
In no particular order:
Universal Harvester by John Darnielle (February 7, Farrar, Straus and Giroux)
Darnielle
Darnielle
Since 2015's Wolf In The White Van , I've been anxiously waiting for the followup from The Mountain Goat's John Darnielle. Apparently he's just one of those guys that's so good at so many thing at this point he's basically rubbing it in our faces.
Woman No. 17 by Edan Lepucki (May 9, Hogarth)
A sexy, noir thriller set in the Hollywood Hills. This one had a lot of recommendations from Twitter,
Perfect Little World by Kevin Wilson (January 24, Ecco)
I adored The Family Fang, Kevin Wilson's delightfully weird, often times laugh-out-loud novel. Perfect Little World promises to be just as strange and great.
Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders (February 14, Random House)
If there is an American writer to be obsessed with in 2017, when our president is a reality TV star and the world seems disastrous and upside down, it's George Saunders. Now, the master of short stories is giving us the gift of his first novel and his timing couldn't be better.
Difficult Women by Roxanne Gay (January 3, Grove Press)
Speaking of timing, we could always use more wisdom from the hilarious and brilliant Roxanne Gay.
All The Lives I Want by Alana Massey (February 7, Grand Central)
Alana Massey is rightfully hailed as one of the sharpest voices today. When she's writing about women and pop culture, there's no one I'd rather read.
Everyone's a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too: A Book by Jomny Sun (June 27, Harper Perennial)
Twitter's favorite alien (well, aliebn) is here with a full length book. Jonny Sun is brilliant and insightful, kind and creative, and a thousand other adjectives that are always so desperately needed.
Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman (February 7, W. W. Norton and Co.)
For those of you who, like me, spent your childhood pouring over a copy D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths , Neil Gaiman's newest book is a gift. It's pure magic and brilliant storytelling from one of the world's best storytellers.
Feminist Baby by Loryn Brantz (April 11, Disney-Hyperion)
God bless any book called "Feminist Baby."
One Day We'll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter: Essays by Scaachi Koul (May 2, Picador)
From following Scaachi on Twitter, I'm already 110% this book will be brilliant
Final Girls by Riley Sager (July 11, Dutton)
If it's good enough for Stephen King, it's good enough for me.
Oola by Brittany Newell (April 25, Holt)
Oola is so good it makes me slightly less infuriated that its author, Brittany Newell, doesn't even graduate college until 2017.
South and West by Joan Didion (March 7, Knopf)
What else needs to be said?
And -- SORRY! -- And We're Off by Dana Schwartz (May 2, Razorbill)
Okay, yes, this one is mine. But, in my defense, I am looking forward for it to come out. This is the first book I've ever written. It's a YA novel about a girl who goes to an arts camp in Ireland and she kisses a boy with an accent and those are both good and fun things.

Texto completo:   Sign up for the Talking Points newsletter, a carefully curated recap of the most important business news, delivered fresh each afternoon, Monday through Friday.
Happy New Year from Talking Points! Here's your recap of the most important business news for Friday, Dec. 30. Financial markets are closed Monday. We'll see you Tuesday.
Chesto Means Business
Maxx-imizing success: No matter what the economy throws at TJX, it keeps winning. And that success is apparently translating into 600 new jobs at the Framingham headquarters of the discount retailer.
While others struggle as consumers do more shopping online, the parent of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains continues its forward march. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 5 percent in the most recent quarter from the same time a year ago; Bloomberg reports that same-store sales have risen every year at TJX since 1999. TJX's stock price has more than doubled in five years to about $75, easily outpacing the broader market.
Shareholders in the No. 1 off-price apparel retailer aren't the only ones reaping the rewards: In a recently filed document with state environmental regulators, TJX discussed plans to increase employees as part of a headquarters expansion, growing from 2,400 to 3,000 over several years. The company will build a 990-space parking garage and put a new conference center on top, replacing existing conference spaces that will be converted to offices. (In the meantime, hundreds of workers will be relocated during the multiyear construction project, which starts in the spring.)
CEO Ernie Herrman's long-term vision calls for adding at least 1,800 stores to the company's base of nearly 3,800 locations. It's an ambitious plan, but one that should ensure more jobs back home.

Market Wrap
Executive Summary
Cheer lift: A storm that dumped up as much as two feet of snow in ski country has mountains from Vermont to Maine expecting a flurry of activity this weekend.
The Globe's Matt Pepin writes that ski resorts were reporting huge crowds of skiers and snowboarders ready to hit the slopes Friday morning. Loon Mountain in New Hampshire was out of parking spots by 10 a.m., and Shawnee Peak in Maine was reporting 100 percent of its trails open.
At Stowe in Vermont, the white stuff was still falling. All of which makes for an uplifting vibe in northern New England.
Something's brewing: A local brewer is expanding for the second time, an indication that the business is growing faster than the head on a freshly poured pint.
Trillium Brewery Company is moving its popular craft brewing operation, but staying in Canton, the Globe's Christina Prignano reports.
That means "more beer, (way) more space, and more fun," Esther Tetreault, the brewery's cofounder, wrote in a letter posted on Trillium's Web site.
Is a gym contract the right fit?: While you're making those New Year's resolutions that include joining a local gym, you might also want to tack "reading the fine print" onto your list.
Globe consumer correspondent Sarah Shemkus writes that gym contracts can be a "complex and restrictive legal contract." That's why it's important to take time before signing on the dotted line.
Among the things you'll want to read carefully is the contract term, how you'll be billed, and the perks and promises being made to you in the name of fitness.
Trending Pick
Tough way to end year: Reports of a growth hormone deficiency drug failing its clinical trial is getting a healthy amount of clicks for the Wall Street Journal, South Florida Business Journal, and other publications. The news sent shares in OPKO Health tumbling.

Peacock flocks to different station: The dress rehearsal for NBC Boston is just about over and coming on Sunday the new station will go live , the Globe's Shirley Leung writes. The station has been putting its staff through "real-time rehearsals."
The change in NBC affiliates has been documented for months, but now it's happening. Even with all the advance warning, there will no doubt be people tuning into WHDH-TV (Channel 7) looking for NBC's Sunday Night Football or their other favorite peacock network shows. Here's a primer on what you need to know.
If your cable company is Charter Spectrum, you may have a hard time tuning into NBC Boston, as well as other related networks such as MSNBC, New England Cable News, and Bravo. Charter Spectrum and NBCUniversal have been unable to reach a new national agreement to carry more than a dozen of the media giant's channels.
WHDH is becoming an independent news station that will also air syndicated shows.

Resumen: To the surprise of advocates and protestors alike, after hours of objections from animal-rights advocates and support from hunters, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission at a June meeting here in the county narrowly voted down, 4-3, a staff recommendation to hold a second bear hunt in October. On arriving at the gymnasium of the Franklin County School, attendees were confronted by an area the size of a baseball diamond reserved for protestors, and...

Texto completo:   Sign up for It's All Downhill, the Globe's skiing and snowboarding newsletter sent every Friday in the winter.
At 7:50 a.m. on Friday, Mount Snow in Vermont tweeted a photo of a fairly sizable group of skiers and snowboarders already lined up to ride the chairlifts that would open at 8 a.m.
At 9:52 a.m., Loon Mountain in New Hampshire announced that it had reached capacity in its parking lots, although lift tickets were still available and shuttle buses from area lodging locations were still running.
At 10:02 a.m., Katie Fogel at Jiminy Peak in the Berkshires region of Massachusetts reported this: "Conditions are powder and packed powder today and the conditions are awesome! We opened one of our most popular trails today -- Jericho."
At 10:05 a.m., Greg Keeler at Cannon Mountain in New Hampshire sent this message: "We're likely going to have one of the busiest days in recent Cannon history."
And at 10:15 a.m., this came in from Rachel Wilkinson at Shawnee Peak in Maine: "We're 100 percent open at Shawnee Peak. 18-20 inches received. Epic day!"
There was euphoria Friday all across New England's ski country following a storm that dropped as much as 2 feet of snow, paving the way for a true powder day that had skiers and snowboarders flocking to the slopes.
"This morning's numbers are above the six-year average we use to gauge visits," said Jennifer Karnan of Gunstock Mountain in New Hampshire. "We were directing guests to our farthest parking lot by 9 a.m. today, which usually doesn't happen until 10. We're expecting record numbers for tomorrow."
In Vermont, the storm allowed for a 15 percent increase in open skiing terrain in the Green Mountain State, according to Ski Vermont's Sarah Wojcik, and allowed several resorts to reach fully open status.
The best part was more snow was falling.
"The real story is that it is snowing harder now than it did yesterday, with [about] 3 inches already down this morning," said Sugarbush representative John Atkinson.
And at Stowe: "It has really been snowing hard this morning," said Scott Braaten. "We had some snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour. As of 11 a.m., our storm total is 9-11 inches and climbing."
But enough words. See for yourself in the photos below, provided by New England ski area representatives at the Globe's request.

Firms that sell off manufacturing gear buy shuttered Maine mill

Resumen: The new owners said they plan to sell off some assets and demolish some structures that are obsolete, but one member of the partnership said the relatively new mill has promise. "Because most of the mill was built in 1980, both the buildings and equipment assets are among the newest of any shuttered paper mill in the Northeast," David Goodman, executive vice president of Perry Videx, said in a prepared statement.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Three industrial asset liquidators have purchased UPM-Kymmene Inc.'s shuttered Madison Paper mill for an undisclosed price, saying they plan to sell off some assets and later market the property to industrial users.
Mill owners UPM and New York Times Co. subsidiary Northern SC Paper Corp. announced the sale Friday to a joint venture of New Mill Capital Holdings of New York, Perry Videx of New Jersey and Infinity Asset Solutions of Toronto. The sale of the mill equipment and land closed Dec. 29.
"We are excited to be the new owners of the Madison mill and look forward to working with local and state officials to identify new uses for the mill site," Gregory Schain, principal of New Mill Capital Holdings, said in a prepared statement. "Bringing new economic life to the property is a key component to this investment for us, and we feel the site's ample infrastructure and the strong area labor force will be attractive for new industries."
The mill stopped production in May, laying off 214 workers, and was Maine's fifth major paper mill closure in three years.
The new owners said they plan to sell off some assets and demolish some structures that are obsolete, but one member of the partnership said the relatively new mill has promise.
"Because most of the mill was built in 1980, both the buildings and equipment assets are among the newest of any shuttered paper mill in the Northeast," David Goodman, executive vice president of Perry Videx, said in a prepared statement. "Additionally, they have been maintained extremely well over the years."
After the sales and demolition process, representatives of the group said they plan to market the property for "alternative industrial uses," noting the site has desirable attributes for heavy industry, such as natural gas connections and nearby electricity generation.
The Madison mill owners said they are still marketing two connected hydropower plants that are capable of generating 27 megawatts of power.
New Mill Capital said it has acquired over 11 million square feet of vacant industrial plants since 2011, "with the vast majority being put back to productive use."
The company handled the auction of the shuttered Old Town Fuel and Fiber plant in April 2015 and bought and remarketed a shuttered Hostess Bakery site in Biddeford, bringing in a FedEx distribution facility.

NCQA's Care Management Accreditation recognizes the best programs in patient care coordination. For more than two decades, the council has driven quality improvement in the American health care system and has set the standard for case management through its health plan accreditation program.
NMMC participates in the Beacon Health program through the Eastern Maine Healthcare System, and as a participant, the facility must meet NCQA care management guidelines to maintain annual recertification. NMMC was the first hospital in Maine to become accredited in November 2015 with its first annual accreditation earned last month.
Tori Gaetani, vice president of care coordination and chief nursing officer for population health was onsite for the first annual survey. Gaetani was joined by survey team members Renae Rice, quality coordinator for Beacon Population Health, and Irene Bouchard, regional manager, north, for care coordination, based out of Beacon Health.
Located in Brewer, Beacon Health is one of 21 Medicare Next Generation accountable care organizations (ACOs) in the country. They are the largest statewide accountable care network in Maine. ACOs are groups of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers who unite voluntarily to give coordinated high-quality care to their Medicare patients.
In order to participate in Beacon's program, NMMC had to demonstrate its ability to meet best practices in coordinated care. According to The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the goal of coordinated care is to ensure that patients, especially the chronically ill, get their right care at the right time, while avoiding unnecessary duplication of services and preventing medical errors.
NMMC's care management program is managed by two part time registered nurses. Both completed the initial training offered through Beacon continuing education, and they receive continuing education via online modules. These care managers are responsible for following best practice protocols defined by NCQA. Between Fort Kent and Madawaska, there are currently 68 active patients enrolled in the program, which implements best practice protocols for specified chronic diseases and for those patients who may need closer follow-up of their health condition.
According to Sandra San Antonio, director of NMMC's medical practices, more than 50 providers, care coordinators, practice managers and clinical data analytic experts throughout the state of Maine meet monthly to discuss and implement the highest standards of care across the Beacon Health network. The quality indicators include patient and family engagement, nurse care coordination, patient self-management education, informed decision making, coordinated chronic disease and preventative care and seamless care for those in hospitals or long-term and skilled nursing facilities.
Beacon Health has documented cost savings while improving the quality of care and quality of life for patients. They began with 9,000 patients benefiting from the model of care and have since grown to more than 125,000 patients across the state.
Patients are referred to the Care Management program through a formal referral process.

Texto completo:   Like everything else in 2016, agriculture in Maine faced a series of ups and downs, most notably because of a severe drought that posed a huge challenge for farmers in need of water for crops and livestock.
The drought left many midsize and small-scale farmers with parched fields and struggling harvests, having to select which crops to carefully irrigate.
However, the overall production rates of state's major crop areas, such as potatoes, apples, blueberries and diversified vegetables, were consistent, according to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, but questions linger about what the new year's growing season will bring.
"It seems like we always end up saying it was a challenging year," DACF Commissioner Walter Whitcomb said. "I don't want to fly in the face of what was a huge problem for producers which was the drought, but I think [the increased production] speaks to the resilience of farmers."
But statewide agriculture organizations say that despite challenging conditions 2016 was an exciting year for the overall realm of local food and farming in Maine -- a year that gives hope to continued growth in the coming 365 days.
"There's a very positive attitude about food and agriculture. It's pretty exciting to be where we are," Whitcomb said.
Over the last year Whitcomb said the DACF worked to figure out how to channel this positive attitude around local food into increasing access and promoting awareness of Maine's products.
In particular, the department spent 2016 in the development stages of a new labeling campaign that will focus around promoting and identifying products that are produced using sustainable farming practices, which many Maine producers are already using, Whitcomb said.
Participation in the labeling is voluntary, but Whitcomb said it's another tool they can offer farmers to help make the consumer aware they are using sustainable soil practices and animal care.
"This is to talk about the good things that are happening on the land and with the animals," Whitcomb said.
While the labeling is still in the development phase, the new marketing campaign will see growth in 2017.
Increasing exposure of Maine products was another goal that DACF tackled in 2016, including having a booth for Maine potato, apple and broccoli producers at the Produce Marketing Association's international trade show in Orlando, Florida. This opportunity allowed these producers to network with wholesale buyers from around the globe. DACF will have a booth at the 2017 trade show as well.
"We want to encourage new farmers, but also help existing farmers sell what they produce and refine their techniques in a world that is very competitive," Whitcomb said.
Next month, the DACF will release its first official agritourism map, which Whitcomb says will increase the exposure of small-scale and midsize farms to not only tourists coming into the state but for Mainers who want to know where they can buy local products. The map is compiled as a standard road map of the state of Maine, but bulleted across the map are 263 Maine farms, farmers markets and farm stands.
The map will be unveiled at the Maine Agricultural Trades Show on Jan. 10 and made available at rest stops and tourism centers around the state.
This year the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association turned 45 years old. Formed in 1971, MOFGA is the oldest and largest state organic organization in the country.
"It was an exciting year in a lot of ways, and it was a challenging year," Heather Spalding, deputy director of MOFGA, said. "Overall we're very encouraged."
With a demand for organic food products on the rise in Maine, as well as nationally, Spalding said MOFGA was busy in 2016 working with Maine's community of organic farmers, gardeners and homesteaders, broadening its reach through county chapter development and increasing the association's presence in Portland.
Organic farms must be certified annually by MOFGA or another regional organic farming entity that is accredited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to certify organic farms. In 2016, MOFGA certified 515 organic farms in Maine, slightly up from last year's certification total. Additionally, while not record breaking turnout, more than 60,000 visitors attended the 40th Common Ground Country Fair. MOFGA also enrolled 50 new farmers in its two-year Journeyperson program, which provides new organic farmers with mentorship and technical assistance ranging from soil science to business planning.
Over the last year, MOFGA also worked toward helping consumers of organic products in terms of access and education. By managing the CSA aspect of Maine Harvest Bucks -- a program that offers matching funds for supplemental nutrition assistance program users who buy local food -- MOFGA helped low-income Mainers have access to organic products.
Spalding said consumer education has been a large focus in 2016 as far as helping consumers understand what the labels on products they buy actually mean and relaying the benefits of buying and eating organic food. MOFGA has compiled this information on their website.
While MOFGA's reach seems sweeping already, looking forward to the new year they hope to engage more individuals outside of the realm of organic farmers.
"We want to do more to help consumers, homesteaders, gardeners, people who aren't connected necessarily to large-scale farms find opportunities to engage and help the mission," Spalding said. "We want to have more events and opportunities for people to get together and share ideas."
Support for protecting the land from which agriculture sprouts also was on the up in 2016, with Maine Farmland Trust receiving its largest monetary donation to date, according to Maine Farmland Trust outreach coordinator Ellen Sabina.
For Maine Farmland Trust, the donation was a boost in the 17-year lifespan of the organization, which works to protect farmland and bolster farmers. The land trust purchases easements on farmland that permanently alter the legal deed of the land to protect it from future development or subdivision, ensuring that the acreage stays forever as farmland. Since the group's organization they have protected 55,000 acres of farmland across the state. In the last year they have worked with 27 farms to protect 4,000 acres.
Sabina called this year's large donation "transformative," though she could not disclose the donor or the number figure associated with the donation. The donation is seeding a $50 million fundraising campaign that Maine Farmland Trust launched this year to come up with the funding to protect 125,000 acres of farmland by 2020.
The original goal was to protect 100,000 acres by 2020, but with the recent donation MFT feels it can save even more land.
"It's a vode of confidence in the work that we're doing," Sabina said. "It's also reflective of how for the local food and agriculture movement has come. People are really thinking about land in relation to their food."
This year, however, MFT canceled its annual Maine Fare, a two-day event that brings people together to celebrate local food through tastings and discussion. MFT attributed cancellation of the Maine Fare to the amount of time that went into putting on the event.
Meanwhile in 2016 MFT expanded a program and began offering Maine Harvest Bucks ,at select retail locations. Like MOFGA, MFT is an coordinator of the Maine Harvest Bucks program, which give matching funds to SNAP shoppers who buy local food so they can purchase more local fruits and vegetables.
Presently, the Harvest Bucks are only offered at a handful of small markets and food co-ops around the state, but in 2017, MFT hopes to expand the program to include some traditional grocery stores.
"In our minds, down the line, it would be really exciting to have [Maine Harvest Bucks] be more in the mainstream," Sabina said.
With a strong community of agriculture organizations and interest from consumers -- despite weather challenges and uncertainties -- there is a resounding sense of hope going into the new year surrounding the prospects of local food and farming.
"It's a really exciting time for agriculture in Maine," Sabina said.

Texto completo:   Public needs to see tax returns
I strongly support Rep. Seth Berry's proposal to require presidential candidates to release their tax returns in Maine. It would be similar to a bill proposed in New York, which would prohibit electors from casting votes for candidates who didn't release their returns.
A bill is not enough, of course, but it's absolutely important and necessary to bring about more transparency and honesty. It should be a truly bipartisan cause, despite the fact that it is in reaction to the incoming Republican president.
True democracy requires that the people have all the facts before them, especially the facts about a candidate's finances, business interests and charitable contributions.

Legalizing pot a bad choice
As a former user when I was young and stupid, I can attest to the euphoria felt when under the influence of pot. This drug was just a platform to the next drug.
Police will now have more then they can handle with drivers under the influence of this controlled substance now that the state has voted to legalize it. Let's not forget to mention the effect it will have on the public.
Yes, it will bring in revenue, but at what cost? We have opened up Pandora's Box, and we may not like what we find in it.

Trump bullies manufacturers
Earlier this month, President-elect Donald Trump made news by bullying an American manufacturer, Boeing, over the cost of designing and producing aircraft made for use by sitting presidents. Trump could save thousands of dollars per hour for American taxpayers by booking flights with commercial airlines or, possibly, even flying on his own plane. But that would be neither practical nor safe, given the needs for the safety and security of sitting presidents.
He also is attacking Lockheed Martin over the cost of producing military aircraft. By extension, might he decide to bully General Dynamics and Bath Iron Works into lowering the cost of producing effective and sophisticated Navy ships here in Maine? We expect our fellow citizens to provide us with durable, dependable, adaptable, long-lasting military aircraft and ships. Would anyone here in Maine care to look a Bath Iron Works employee in the eye and say, "You're not worth what you're getting paid?"

Bigotry has no place in school
From 2012 to 2014 I attended the Maine Academy of Natural Sciences. The academy's unique educational model stimulated my intellectual curiosity and permitted the pursuit of my desires. This model is predicated on the idea that schooling should be tailored to the interests and experiences of individual students. This is in stark contrast to our society that instills senses of entitlement or worthlessness on the basis of one's race, class, gender identity, sexuality, ability. So it is insulting that Gov. Paul LePage, who exhibits oppressive behavior with astounding frequency, was chosen to speak at the academy's charter renewal ceremony earlier this month.
From making blatantly racist statements and calling and leaving a voice message for a state legislator laced with obscenities and intensifying the poverty suffered by Maine's youth, including students who may attend the academy, LePage's bigotry and incompetence are clear.
Social and economic equality are preconditions for success in public education. Students fearing deportation or racist attacks from vigilantes and police can't be expected to succeed in school. Teachers can't adequately perform their jobs while their salaries and pensions are decimated by budget cuts. Nor can students focus on homework on empty stomachs. LePage's personal viewpoints and public policies perpetuate racism, xenophobia, misogyny and poverty. These dynamics manifest within classrooms, undermining the function of public education.
The decision to allow LePage to speak at the academy is an effective endorsement of his bigoted and oppressive policies and views.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- Thanks to a fast-moving storm system, New Year's Eve revelers in Bangor can expect to see snow when the beach ball is thrown off the top of Paddy Murphy's at midnight to welcome in the new year.
"We have a fast-moving low-pressure system, an 'Alberta clipper,' that is heading our way," meteorologist Priscilla Farrar said Friday. "It's going to bring snow to the area late Saturday. On New Year's Eve night it's going to be snowing down there."
Bangor should get 3 to 5 inches of snow between Saturday night and Sunday morning, but only 2 to 4 inches are predicted in Down East areas and 1 to 3 inches are expected to fall up north in The County, the forecaster said.
The low-pressure system heading toward Maine formed in Alberta in western Canada and is expected to cause temperatures to plunge, Farrar said.
"It looks like on New Year's Eve night it's going to be in the mid-20s, which is 5 to 10 degrees lower than normal for the Bangor area," she said.
Bangor's ball drop is the finale of the daylong Downtown Countdown, Bangor's signature New Year's Eve event, which features a 5K run, facepainting for kids, poetry, a vintage burlesque show, music, dancing and more.

Texto completo:   ORONO, Maine -- For nine years, Denise Card has kept a small flock of chickens in the backyard of her home in the Tough End neighborhood of Orono.
She loves "her girls" and tries to keep them safe and happy in the cold weather, which recently dipped to well below zero degrees Fahrenheit. Card provides them with high-calorie chicken scratch to help her backyard flock stay a little warmer. She has a heated water bucket and has been known to put petroleum jelly on the birds' combs, which can help prevent frostbite. She also strives to keep away the winter blues by giving them more things to do -- for example, she will hang two apples in an onion bag up high, which the birds jump up and peck at, like a pinata.
But one thing many Mainers do to keep their poultry warm in the winter -- install heat lamps in their coop -- scares her.
"There's so many people who want to heat with lights. It's just really dangerous," Card said. "Heat lamps are so dangerous. They fall over. Chickens can fly into them. Dust can get into them and can ignite. Heat lights can burn down farm buildings all the time."
Although it may be a temptation to use a heat lamp, she and other poultry aficionados say it isn't worth it. Scott DeMoranville of 4Ds Farm in Bradford has raised poultry for more than 40 years and enjoys educating others about the joys and challenges of raising backyard chickens and other birds on the Facebook page Maine Poultry Connection. During Maine's recent deep freeze, many concerned chicken owners used the page as a forum to share their concerns, tips and even photos of chickens with frostbitten combs among other things.
On the Facebook page, DeMoranville tries to make it clear that chickens are born wearing warm down coats and that responsible chicken owners don't actually need to do much more to make sure they stay safe in the winter.
"Nature has provided for those birds," he said. "You give them adequate housing and bedding for the roosts, and they don't need any heat. I tell people all the time: Think of the wild birds. They roost in a big tree. They don't have a roof over their heads. They do fine."
A 250-watt heat lamp bulb can get so hot that it can ignite an errant pine shaving or plywood, especially if a 4-plus pound chicken accidentally flies up toward it and knocked it down.
"We have a couple members of the Maine Poultry Connection that in the last five years have lost their homes to heat lamps. There's already been barn fires this year because of them."
DeMoranville recommends never using anything with a heat source in a henhouse, including a water heater.
"If people want to heat it, I suggest they put heated water outside," he said.
As for frostbite on chicken's combs, he said the best thing is to have a well-ventilated henhouse. People should clean chicken droppings out of the henhouses, with a focus on changing heavily soiled bedding. That will help reduce moisture in the coop, he said.
"For a chicken to be breathing moist air constantly is a recipe for illness," he said.
Finally, if people use artificial light in the coops to encourage their hens to lay, DeMoranville recommends waking the birds up with the artificial light but letting them go to bed with the sun. Otherwise, the plan can backfire. That's because the chickens' metabolism slows down when the sun starts to set. The birds "eat ferociously," he said, so they fill their crops to digest overnight.
"With artificial light, chickens don't know enough to fill their crops. They don't know enough to get on their roosts. It stresses them out. They go to bed hungry and ill-prepared," he said. "A bird that is stressed tends not to lay eggs."

Resumen: Game wardens responded to 182 reports of snowmobile-related incidents last season, which ran from Nov. 1, 2015, to April 10, 2016, including 12 search-and-rescue operations. MacDonald said technology like cellphones and GPS has helped reduce the number of rescue operations in the last several years, but Meyers cautioned that cellphone reception can be spotty around Maine, so it's best not to rely solely on smartphone GPS trackers.

Texto completo:   Live coverage of annual warden service reminder about safety on the trails this snowmobile season.
AUGUSTA -- Maine snowmobile season unofficially kicks off this weekend, and officials expect thousands of people to hit the 14,500 miles of trails across the state.
The Maine Warden Service and Maine Snowmobile Association held a news conference at the North Augusta Trailblazers clubhouse Thursday to highlight the need for snowmobile safety as the season gets underway.
"Everybody is excited because we didn't have a lot of snow last year to snowmobile," said Cpl. John MacDonald, public information officer for the warden service. "We want to make sure we don't have incidents this weekend that we need to report on Monday."
Maine was expected to receive heavy snowfall Thursday, with some portions on northern and western Maine predicted to get more than a foot. MacDonald said the snowfall is great news for snowmobilers, but it could create problems on lakes and ponds.
"Our greatest fear from a search-and-rescue standpoint is heavy snow obscuring the ice and what the condition of the ice might be underneath (the snow)," he said. "We've had good weather for this time of year and the ice has done pretty well, but the snow is going to obscure just how safe some of the ice might be."
MacDonald and Bob Meyers, executive director of the Maine Snowmobile Association, said there are several simple things snowmobilers can do that might end up being the difference between life and death.
Drinking and driving a snowmobile doesn't mix, MacDonald said, and it's important always to stay on marked trails and operate the snowmobile at a safe and reasonable speed. The most common factors in snowmobile crashes, according to Maine Warden Service data, are driving too fast for conditions, beyond the effectiveness of headlights and beyond the operator's abilities.
Meyers said New Year's weekend is traditionally a big weekend for snowmobiling, and he expects many of the 75,000 or so registered snowmobiles to be out on the trails. He reminded everybody to have a good time while being safe and cautious.
"Always keep your sled under control, be aware of your surroundings and don't ride alone," Meyers said. "Keep an eye out for everybody when you're out there, and we'll have a terrific season."
One of the things Meyers said people could do to help officials in the event of a problem is to leave a note on the dashboard of their car or truck saying who they are, where they are going and what time they expect to return. It gives rescuers a better idea of where to look for someone who's lost.
Game wardens responded to 182 reports of snowmobile-related incidents last season, which ran from Nov. 1, 2015, to April 10, 2016, including 12 search-and-rescue operations. There were 97 crashes, including 67 involving injury and five fatalities.
MacDonald said technology like cellphones and GPS has helped reduce the number of rescue operations in the last several years, but Meyers cautioned that cellphone reception can be spotty around Maine, so it's best not to rely solely on smartphone GPS trackers.
Snowmobile operators should bring a small survival pack with them that contains essentials such as dry socks, gloves, a hat, a flashlight and matches to light a fire. MacDonald's pack also had ice pick awls for self-rescue for someone who has fallen through ice.
"If you go through the ice, it's almost impossible to get back on the ice, especially if you're wearing all this snowmobile gear," MacDonald said. "The Picks of Life will save your life, because when you slam them into the ice, they deploy a little pick that goes into the ice, and they allow you to drag yourself up. They are the key to keeping you alive."
On Christmas Day, two women were stranded overnight in subzero weather when their snowmobiles got stuck. A third woman went to get help, but her snowmobile ran out of gas and she ended up spending the night in a stranger's cabin.
MacDonald said it's common for at least one snowmobile in a group to carry extra gas, but he recommends everybody have the necessary emergency supplies in case of an unexpected overnight stay in the woods.
"Knowing where you're going can be a significant factor in getting lost, so familiarize yourself with the terrain and the area," he said. "Usually you're better off to stay together as a group until somebody else comes to help. We don't generally favor any party splitting up."
MacDonald said snowmobilers can expect to see random checkpoints on trails this weekend, and because Saturday is New Year's Eve, he urged people to be even more cautious and responsible when it comes to drinking and driving a snowmobile.
"It's likely to cause some issues for us, but we hope that it doesn't," he said. "We hope that if people have been drinking, they'll stay home and don't hit the trails."

Texto completo:   Vehicle rollover leaves passengers with serious injuries
The Somerset County Sheriff's Office is investigating a single-vehicle rollover crash Thursday morning in New Portland that sent two people to the hospital with serious injuries.
The crash happened at 11:14 a.m. on Route 27 in New Portland. A passing motorist called police, saying the occupants of the overturned car were trapped inside, according to a news release from the sheriff's office.
The driver, Robert Bernier, 47, of New Vineyard, and the passenger, Stacy O'Neal, 41, of New Vineyard, were trapped in the wreckage and gas was leaking from the car, police said.
The pair were freed from the vehicle, but they suffered serious injuries including cuts. The LifeFlight helicopter service was contacted but was unable to provide help because of the snowstorm moving into Maine.
Sugarloaf Rescue had responded as well, and both were taken initially to Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington.
Bernier stayed at Franklin Memorial; O'Neal was found to have possible life-threatening injuries and was taken to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston.
Bernier was driving with a conditional license, which was for a previous conviction of operating under the influence.
Speed and alcohol are being investigated as possible factors contributing to the accident, further charges are possible, and the accident remains under investigation, the sheriff's office said.
The New Portland Fire Department and a state game warden were on the scene first, and Kingfield Fire Department also was dispatched to assist. Somerset County Sheriff's Deputy Toby Blodgett, Cpl. David Cole and Deputy Craig Dyer responded as well.

Texto completo:   National Weather Service says 5 to 8 inches expected in Waterville at storm's end
As the season's first nor'easter swept across Maine on Thursday, forecasts called for warmer temperature, rain and lower predicted snowfall amounts in some areas of central Maine.
At the National Weather Service office in Gray, meteorologist James Brown said 5 to 8 inches is predicted in the Augusta/Waterville area as the storm winds down this morning, with greater amounts expected north and west to Skowhegan and Farmington. The rain-snow line also was expected to creep farther inland than initially thought -- that was the case in Belfast by late afternoon -- and the farther west the warm air travels, the better the chance of a switchover from snow to rain, Brown said.
Another weather service meteorologist, Chris Kimble, said Thursday evening that Waterville probably would be the northern extent of where the rain-snow line will reach. But he said if that line didn't make it, the area could be blanketed by "well more than a foot" of snow -- exceeding the 5-to-8-inches forecast.
With heavy, wet snow, the chance for downed trees and power lines also increases.
"The storm is actually going to move up through about Boothbay or so and straight north through Maine and right up into Canada, and that means anything to the east is going to probably get a pretty good surge of warm air, changing things over pretty far inland," Brown said.
The weather service was predicting 12 to 20 inches of snow in the Farmington area, with 10 to 13 inches possible in the Skowhegan area and most of Somerset County. The snow started in central Maine just after noon Thursday, leaving about 2 inches in Kennebec County areas after a few hours, and was expected to intensify rapidly overnight.
A winter storm warning was in effect for central Maine until this morning. In anticipation of the season's first big storm, Central Maine Power Co. is offering a link to the forecast office for a statewide view of storm warnings and advisories.
"The other problem that's going to happen is we're going to see cold air flow in behind the system, with some snow in behind it during the early morning hours Friday after that changeover occurs," Brown said.
Wind gusts could reach 20 to 30 mph away from the coast, Brown said.
CMP spokesman John Carroll said crews were bracing for the worst and reinforcements were called in from Canada, Connecticut and New York state. They were prepared to hit the ground running at 5 a.m. today, he said.
"The forecast that we've seen is really for a mixed bag, so several aspects of it will be difficult," Carroll said. "There's going to be a band of some pretty wet, heavy snow, and that is going to cause problems with trees and limbs. Along the coast we're also expecting some pretty high winds -- gusts into the 50s."
Deep snow and high wind in central Maine also will be challenging, he said.
Carroll said 100 CMP crews would be ready to go at daybreak today, with 125 contract crews from Quebec, New Brunswick, New York and Connecticut also ready to be dispatched to problem areas. About 100 tree crews also are standing by for duty. Carroll said CMP serves about 610,000 business and residential customers from the New Hampshire border in York and Cumberland counties, up to Bucksport, Bangor and across to Jackman and the rest of Somerset and Franklin counties.
He said in the event of power outages, customers can go to the company's website and sign up for outage alerts either by text, by email or by phone. There also is an "outage central" link on the website for up-to-the-minute information about power outages and estimated restoration times.
In Waterville, Mark Turner, director of public works, said his 13 trucks and crews went on duty at 7 a.m. Thursday preparing for whatever the storm throws at them.
"The rain and snow line is going to be right on us, but I think we're going to end up with the majority of it being snow and mix," Turner said. "We're ready with our trucks right now, all loaded and ready to go, and we're probably going to be plowing and sanding."
Turner said his department will have a crew of 18 to 20 people, with some on the ground clearing sidewalks and other areas downtown and mechanics who will be on duty all night.
"We'll stay right through the night if we have to," he said.
At the Department of Public Works in Augusta, Director Lesley Jones said updated weather forecasts are showing the storm could end up being all snow in the capital city by the time it winds down Friday.
Jones said her department has about 40 employees with 21 plow routes for 350 lane miles of road and another 150 miles of sidewalks.
"We have about 10 people out now," Jones said Thursday afternoon as intermittent snow continued to fall. "We have a crew home resting. If we need them, the crew that worked last night will come back in at some point. Right now we're doing the main arterials and the country roads and just the trouble spots on the city runs."
Jones, with 30 years in the Public Works Department, six of those as director, said her crews are ready to hit the streets with equipment for as much as is needed for as long as it takes to get the job done.
"We're ready to tackle whatever we get for snow, rain," she said. "We're geared up for 5 to 10 inches or whatever Mother Nature brings us."
In Skowhegan, Road Commissioner Greg Dore said he thinks the storm will bring mostly snow to the area, an estimated 12 to 16 inches, depending on the coastal track of the storm.
"We've been spending the morning getting their chains ready and going through their equipment, making sure they don't have any breakdowns during the storm, doing whatever we can to prevent that from happening," Dore said.
Dore said he will have 13 people working in nine trucks, including a sidewalk plow; two in loaders; and one in a grader.

Texto completo:   Live coverage of annual warden service reminder about safety on the trails this snowmobile season.
AUGUSTA -- Maine snowmobile season unofficially kicks off this weekend, and officials expect thousands of people to hit the 14,500 miles of trails across the state.
The Maine Warden Service and Maine Snowmobile Association held a news conference at the North Augusta Trailblazers clubhouse Thursday to highlight the need for snowmobile safety as the season gets underway.

"We're ready to tackle whatever we get for snow, rain," she said. "We're geared up for 5 to 10 inches or whatever Mother Nature brings us."
In Skowhegan, Road Commissioner Greg Dore said he thinks the storm will bring mostly snow to the area, an estimated 12 to 16 inches, depending on the coastal track of the storm.
"We've been spending the morning getting their chains ready and going through their equipment, making sure they don't have any breakdowns during the storm, doing whatever we can to prevent that from happening," Dore said.
Dore said he will have 13 people working in nine trucks, including a sidewalk plow; two in loaders; and one in a grader.

Texto completo:   The Somerset County Sheriff's Office is investigating a single-vehicle rollover crash Thursday morning in New Portland that sent two people to the hospital with serious injuries.
The crash happened at 11:14 a.m. on Route 27 in New Portland. A passing motorist called police, saying the occupants of the rolled-over car were trapped inside, according to a sheriff's office news release.
The driver, Robert Bernier, 47, of New Vineyard, and the passenger, Stacy O'Neal, 41, of New Vineyard, were trapped in the wreckage and gas was leaking from the overturned car, police said. The pair were freed from the vehicle, but they suffered serious injuries including cuts. The LifeFlight helicopter service was contacted but was unable to provide help because of the snowstorm moving into Maine.
Sugarloaf Rescue had responded as well, and both were taken initially to Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington. Bernier stayed at Franklin Memorial; O'Neal was found to have possible life-threatening injuries and was taken to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston.
Bernier was driving with a conditional license, which was for a previous conviction of operating under the influence. Speed and alcohol are being investigated as possible factors contributing to the accident, further charges are possible, and the accident remains under investigation, the sheriff's office said.
The New Portland Fire Department and a state game warden were on the scene first, and the Kingfield Fire Department also was dispatched to assist. Somerset County Sheriff's Deputy Toby Blodgett, Cpl. David Cole and Deputy Craig Dyer responded as well.

Texto completo:   Mike Harmon, former city editor and conservative columnist for MaineToday Media, has died.
A few days before he died, Michael D. Harmon accomplished something that made him stand tall and proud. A newly ordained priest, the 71-year-old led the Christmas service at the Church of the Prince of Peace in Sanford, a small congregation that he helped establish more than a decade ago. He performed the ceremony in a vestment sewn by his wife, Margaret.
"It was such an important moment for him," said the Rev. John Clifton. "It was such an accomplishment."
A conservative columnist for the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, Harmon was killed Wednesday when a handgun discharged at his home in Sanford while it was being handled by a 16-year-old visitor, police said. State and local police are investigating and have released few details. Harmon's family has described the shooting as accidental and declined to discuss it further.
Harmon, who was born in Buffalo, New York, grew up in Pennsylvania and came to Maine to study at Bowdoin College, graduating in 1967. After serving in the Army in Vietnam, he returned to Maine in 1969 and began working at the newspaper soon after, moving up the ranks from reporter. His opinion columns, which he began writing in the 1990s, elicited strong reader response, often on the issue of gun control.
"He was an opinionated man and a good man," said his wife, Margaret Harmon. "People liked him. They might not agree with him, but they liked him."
In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children from a previous marriage and two stepchildren, as well as several grandchildren and two siblings.
Harmon became an ordained priest this year, fulfilling a long-held goal that allowed him to take his passion for Christian teaching to a different level, Clifton said.
"Mike was a man who believed with all his heart that God gives you talents and abilities, and he gives you them for a reason. He gives them to you to serve, and your greatest fulfillment is to offer them to others," Clifton said. "That's what Mike did. He threw himself into everything he did, and everything he did, he did diligently and enthusiastically."
TOUGH DEBATER, EFFECTIVE COLUMNIST
Friends, colleagues and idealogical adversaries remembered Harmon as a man of principle and commitment, who consistently advanced Christian and conservative themes and opinions in his weekly newspaper column, which continued after his retirement in 2011. Over a 41-year career at the paper, he served in various roles, including city editor and editorial writer.
Tom Allen, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maine, remembered Harmon as a college friend and political sparring partner. They met in an English class at Bowdoin and remained friends. When Allen met with the newspaper's editorial board as a lawmaker, he always knew Harmon would challenge him.
"We wound up disagreeing on our interpretation of Chaucer and we wound up disagreeing politically the rest of our lives, but I always thought Mike was a very decent human being," Allen said. "Mike asked good questions and he took his job very seriously. I always enjoyed our conversations, and I always thought he was a thoughtful and intelligent person who grappled with the issues of the day."
In his writing, Harmon returned to several topics consistently. He supported pro-Christian causes and was a staunch defender of the First Amendment. He was against gay marriage, doubtful of the science behind global warming and a strong supporter of gun rights.
Harmon was effective as a columnist because he argued his positions based on principle, not politics, said Portland Press Herald Editorial Page Editor Greg Kesich.
"He was not politically active and didn't particularly care who won elections," Kesich said. "He was more interested in what happened between elections. He spoke to a number of people in the readership who may have otherwise been left out of the conversation. He was a very strong national security conservative, he was a social conservative and he was an economic conservative. He did not waver on any of these things, and he would write strong, well-argued opinions."
Soon after becoming a columnist, Harmon arrived at work to find a spray-painted message - "Fire Mike Harmon" - on the side of the newspaper's former building at 390 Congress St.
"He was always quite proud of that," Kesich said. "He always got a strong response, because he argued in a strong way."
COMMUNITY LOSES AN ESTABLISHED VOICE
Carroll Conley Jr. was shocked when he encountered Harmon for the first time in 2010. Conley had just become director of the Christian Civic League of Maine, and Harmon called requesting an interview. Conley, who lived in northern Maine and was not familiar with Harmon's writing, was surprised to find such a conservative voice in the community. They became friends, and Conley supported Harmon in his effort to become ordained. "From a human perspective, what I feel now is just sadness," Conley said.
Ideologically, it will be difficult to replace such a respected and established voice in the community, he said. "He was an asset to the state and to the kingdom of God. We will miss Mike's voice," Conley said.
Tom Waddell, director of the Maine chapter of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, met Harmon at a rally in Augusta where the Rev. Franklin Graham was speaking. Waddell was there to protest Graham's appearance. Harmon was writing about the rally and interviewed Waddell for his column.
"Although we were on opposite sides, as was usually the case, Mike was upfront and honest about his perspective and accurately quoted my dissenting opinion in his column," Waddell said. "I feel Mike was a man of solid character who had no hidden agendas and reported on events the way he saw them. He will be missed."
He will be missed in ways that most people won't see, Clifton said. At least once a year, Harmon went to the state prison in Warren to "share the message of God and offer hope and a chance for renewal," he said. And most Saturdays, Harmon would sit on a park bench in Sanford with a sign that read, "Father Michael Will Talk for Free." He wanted people to come to him with their problems, his wife said.
"He met a lot of interesting people with a lot of different problems," she said. "He would pray with them and try to help them out."
Harmon also taught English and history at his church school, and he was thrilled at becoming ordained because it allowed him to reach people in new ways through the ministry, Clifton said.
"Mike took his faith seriously," he said. "It was a fundamental part of his life. His death is a loss not just to our church, but to the entire Christian community." Bob Keyes can be contacted at 791-6457 or at: bkeyes@pressherald.com Twitter: pphbkeyes

Texto completo:   fund details and list of donors
The Portland Press Herald Toy Fund's annual monthlong raffle generated $2,690, as of Thursday, to help buy toys for children.
And it's not too late to pitch in and get a shot at winning the grand prize: a package of nine lift tickets to Maine ski resorts.
The raffle has been running all month with daily drawings for donated prizes that have included gift certificates to a variety of restaurants, a photography package, a portrait of your pet and a Kindle Fire. The winner of the most valuable prize - a package of ski passes worth $500 - will be drawn Saturday.
It costs $10 to buy one raffle ticket, $50 for 6 entries and $100 for 15 entries. All the proceeds go to the toy fund.
To enter the raffle Friday, go to pressheraldtoyfund.org, make a donation and type "raffle" into the dedication line.
The Portland Press Herald Toy Fund in the Spirit of Bruce Roberts uses donations from readers to provide holiday toys to thousands of Maine children who might otherwise not receive holiday gifts because of hardships faced by their parents.
The fund - now in its 67th year - provided gifts during this holiday season to needy families in Cumberland, York, Sagadahoc, Lincoln and Knox counties.
Donations to help buy the toys can be made on the website or by writing checks to the Portland Press Herald Toy Fund and mailing them to the fund at P.O. Box 7310, Portland, ME 04112. The fund continues to raise money toward its goal of $200,000.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- Maine officials expect thousands of snowmobilers to head out to the 14,500 miles of trails across the state this weekend.
Snow cover is already better in many areas of Maine than it ever got last winter.
The Maine Warden Service and Maine Snowmobile Association held a news conference at the North Augusta Trailblazers clubhouse Thursday to highlight the need for snowmobile safety as the season gets underway on the holiday weekend.
"Everybody is excited because we didn't have a lot of snow last year to snowmobile," said Cpl. John MacDonald, public information officer for the warden service. "We want to make sure we don't have incidents this weekend that we need to report on Monday."
Heavy snowfall was forecast for much of the state Thursday and Friday, with some portions of northern and western Maine likely to get more than a foot. MacDonald said the snowfall is great news for snowmobilers, but it could create problems on lakes and ponds.
"Our greatest fear from a search-and-rescue standpoint is heavy snow obscuring the ice and what the condition of the ice might be underneath (the snow)," he said. "We've had good weather for this time of year and the ice has done pretty well, but the snow is going to obscure just how safe some of the ice might be."
MacDonald and Bob Meyers, executive director of the Maine Snowmobile Association, said there are several simple things snowmobilers can do to reduce risk.
Drinking and driving a snowmobile don't mix, MacDonald said, and it's important always to stay on marked trails and operate the snowmobile at a safe and reasonable speed. The most common factors in snowmobile crashes, according to warden service data, are driving too fast for trail conditions and the operator's abilities, and failing to slow down when riding at night.
"Always keep your sled under control, be aware of your surroundings and don't ride alone," Meyers said. "Keep an eye out for everybody when you're out there, and we'll have a terrific season."
One of the things snowmobilers should do is to leave a note on the dashboard of their vehicle saying who they are, where they are going and what time they expect to return. It gives rescuers a better idea of where to look if someone gets lost, Meyers said.
New Year's is traditionally a big weekend for snowmobiling, and Meyers said he expects many of the state's 75,000 or so registered snowmobiles to be out on the trails.
Game wardens responded to 182 reports of snowmobile-related incidents last season, which ran from Nov. 1, 2015, to April 10, including 12 search-and-rescue operations. There were 97 crashes, 67 involving injury, and five fatalities.
On Christmas Day, two women were stranded overnight in subzero weather when their snowmobiles got stuck. A third woman went to get help, but her snowmobile ran out of gas.
MacDonald said technology like cellphones and GPS has helped reduce the number of rescue operations in the past several years, but Meyers cautioned that cellphone reception can be spotty around Maine, so it's best not to rely solely on smartphone GPS trackers.
Snowmobile operators should bring a small survival pack with them with extra dry socks, gloves, a hat, a flashlight and matches. MacDonald's pack also contains ice pick awls.
"If you go through the ice, it's almost impossible to get back on the ice, especially if you're wearing all this snowmobile gear," MacDonald said. "The Picks of Life will save your life, because when you slam them into the ice, they deploy a little pick that goes into the ice, and they allow you to drag yourself up. They are the key to keeping you alive."
MacDonald said at least one snowmobile in a group should carry extra gas, but he recommends everybody have the necessary emergency supplies in case of an unexpected overnight stay in the woods.
MacDonald said snowmobilers can expect to see random checkpoints on trails this weekend, and because Saturday is New Year's Eve, he urged people to be even more cautious and responsible.
"It's likely to cause some issues for us, but we hope that it doesn't," he said. "We hope that if people have been drinking, they'll stay home and don't hit the trails." Jason Pafundi can be contacted at 621-5663 or at: jpafundi@centralmaine.com Twitter: jasonpafundiKJ

Since the election, news reports indicate that national organizations like the ACLU have received more than $7 million in increased donations.

Texto completo:   More than 30 LGBTQ and allied teens from Mount Desert Island and Blue Hill down to Boothbay Harbor recently gathered with OUT Maine at the First Universalist Church in Rockland for a retreat to talk about their fears and challenges in their schools over the last month. The stories were very disturbing, as it appears that some Mainers now feel emboldened to express their hateful and discriminatory perspectives in the new national climate, according to a news release from OUT Maine.
"We think that what we are seeing on the national news isn't happening here in Maine," said Jeanne Dooley, executive director of OUT Maine, according to the release. "But that couldn't be farther from the truth." Too many attending youth were dealing with increased bullying and harassment since Nov. 7.
The retreat, led by OUT Maine staff and volunteers, as well as teachers from Mount Desert Island and Blue Hill, gave youth the opportunity to talk about ways to address these issues in their schools. Perhaps even more important, they were heard and supported in this increasingly vulnerable time.
OUT Maine supports, educates and empowers rural LGBTQ youth by providing community safe spaces, changing school climate through education and the building of Gay/Straight/Trans Alliances (school clubs), building a strong provider safety net by training health and mental health providers, school staff, clergy and other youth service organizations, and supporting parents and families of these at-risk youth to reduce homelessness.
Since the election, news reports indicate that national organizations like the ACLU have received more than $7 million in increased donations. Dooley shares that OUT Maine has not seen any increase in its donations. "While the work of the ACLU is critical at the national level, OUT Maine's work directly influences our local climate, for youth and our communities," Dooley said. "We would love to see local people who feel energized by the election and want to help make the choice to support OUT Maine."

Texto completo:   A few days before he died, Mike Harmon accomplished something that made him stand tall and proud. A newly ordained minister, the 71-year-old led the Christmas service at the Church of the Prince of Peace in Sanford, a small congregation that he helped establish more than a decade ago. He performed the ceremony in vestments sewn by his wife, Margaret.
"It was such an important moment for him," said the Rev. John Clifton. "It was such an accomplishment."
A conservative columnist for the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, Harmon died Wednesday in a shooting at his home in Sanford. State and local police are investigating and have released few details.
Harmon was showing a gun to a 16-year-old, who was handling it when it discharged, police said. Harmon's family has described the shooting as accidental and declined to discuss it further.
Harmon, who was born in Buffalo, New York, grew up in Pennsylvania and came to Maine to study at Bowdoin College, graduating in 1967. After serving in the Army in Vietnam, he returned to Maine in 1969 and began working at the newspaper soon afterward, moving up the ranks from reporter. His opinion columns, which he began writing in the 1990s, elicited strong reader response, often on the issue of gun control.
"He was an opinionated man and a good man," said his wife, Margaret Harmon. "People liked him. They might not agree with him, but they liked him."
In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children from a previous marriage and two stepchildren, as well as several grandchildren and two siblings.
Harmon became an ordained minister this year, fulfilling a long-held goal that allowed him to take his passion for Christian teaching to a different level, Clifton said.
"Mike was a man who believed with all his heart that God gives you talents and abilities, and he gives you them for a reason. He gives them to you to serve, and your greatest fulfillment is to offer them to others," Clifton said. "That's what Mike did. He threw himself into everything he did, and everything he did, he did diligently and enthusiastically."
Friends, colleagues and idealogical adversaries remembered Harmon as a man of principle and commitment, who consistently advanced Christian and conservative themes and opinions in his weekly newspaper column, which continued after his retirement in 2011. Over a 41-year career at the paper, he served in various roles, including as city editor and editorial writer.
Tom Allen, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maine, remembered Harmon as a college friend and political sparring partner.
They met in an English class at Bowdoin and remained friends. When Allen met with the newspaper's editorial board as a lawmaker, he always knew Harmon would challenge him.
"We wound up disagreeing on our interpretation of Chaucer and we wound up disagreeing politically the rest of our lives, but I always thought Mike was a very decent human being," Allen said.
"Mike asked good questions and he took his job very seriously. I always enjoyed our conversations, and I always thought he was a thoughtful and intelligent person who grappled with the issues of the day."
In his writing, Harmon returned to several topics consistently. He supported pro-Christian causes and was a staunch defender of the First Amendment. He was against gay marriage, doubtful of the science behind global warming and a strong supporter of gun rights.
Harmon was effective as a columnist because he argued his positions based on principle, not politics, said Portland Press Herald Editorial Page Editor Greg Kesich. "He was not politically active and didn't particularly care who won elections," Kesich said. "He was more interested in what happened between elections. He spoke to a number of people in the readership who may have otherwise been left out of the conversation. He was a very strong national security conservative, he was a social conservative and he was an economic conservative. He did not waver on any of these things, and he would write strong, well-argued opinions."
Soon after becoming a columnist, Harmon arrived at work to find a spray-painted message -- "Fire Mike Harmon" -- on the side of the newspaper's former building at 390 Congress St.
"He was always quite proud of that," Kesich said. "He always got a strong response, because he argued in a strong way."
Carroll Conley Jr. was shocked when he encountered Harmon for the first time in 2010. Conley had just become director of the Christian Civic League of Maine, and Harmon called, requesting an interview.
Conley, who lived in northern Maine and was unfamiliar with Harmon's writing, was surprised to find such a conservative voice in the community. They became friends, and Conley supported Harmon in his effort to become ordained. "From a human perspective, what I feel now is just sadness," Conley said.
Ideologically, it will be difficult to replace such a respected and established voice in the community, he added.
"He was an asset to the state and to the kingdom of God. We will miss Mike's voice," Conley said.
Tom Waddell, director of the Maine Chapter of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, met Harmon at a rally in Augusta where the Rev. Franklin Graham was speaking. Waddell was there to protest Graham's appearance.
Harmon was writing about the rally and interviewed Waddell for his column.
"Although we were on opposite sides, as was usually the case, Mike was upfront and honest about his perspective and accurately quoted my dissenting opinion in his column," Waddell said.
"I feel Mike was a man of solid character who had no hidden agendas and reported on events the way he saw them. He will be missed."
He will be missed in ways that most people won't see, Clifton said. At least once a year, Harmon went to the state prison in Warren to "share the message of God and offer hope and a chance for renewal," he said. And most Saturdays, Harmon would sit on a park bench in Sanford with a sign that read, "Father Michael Will Talk for Free." He wanted people to come to him with their problems, his wife said.
"He met a lot of interesting people with a lot of different problems," she said. "He would pray with them and try to help them out."
Harmon also taught English and history at his church school, and he was thrilled at becoming ordained because it allowed him to reach people in new ways, through the ministry, Clifton said.
"Mike took his faith seriously," Clifton said. "It was a fundamental part of his life. His death is a loss not just to our church, but to the entire Christian community."

Resumen: OUT Maine supports, educates and empowers rural LGBTQ youth by providing community safe spaces, changing school climate through education and the building of Gay/Straight/Trans Alliances (school clubs), building a strong provider safety net by training health and mental health providers, school staff, clergy and other youth service organizations, and supporting parents and families of these at-risk youth to reduce homelessness. Since the election, news reports indicate that national organizations like the ACLU have received more than $7 million in increased donations.

Texto completo:   More than 30 LGBTQ and allied teens from Mount Desert Island and Blue Hill down to Boothbay Harbor recently gathered with OUT Maine at the First Universalist Church in Rockland for a retreat to talk about their fears and challenges in their schools over the last month. The stories were very disturbing, as it appears that some Mainers now feel emboldened to express their hateful and discriminatory perspectives in the new national climate, according to a news release from OUT Maine.
"We think that what we are seeing on the national news isn't happening here in Maine," said Jeanne Dooley, executive director of OUT Maine, according to the release. "But that couldn't be farther from the truth." Too many attending youth were dealing with increased bullying and harassment since Nov. 7.
The retreat, led by OUT Maine staff and volunteers, as well as teachers from Mount Desert Island and Blue Hill, gave youth the opportunity to talk about ways to address these issues in their schools. Perhaps even more important, they were heard and supported in this increasingly vulnerable time.
OUT Maine supports, educates and empowers rural LGBTQ youth by providing community safe spaces, changing school climate through education and the building of Gay/Straight/Trans Alliances (school clubs), building a strong provider safety net by training health and mental health providers, school staff, clergy and other youth service organizations, and supporting parents and families of these at-risk youth to reduce homelessness.
Since the election, news reports indicate that national organizations like the ACLU have received more than $7 million in increased donations. Dooley shares that OUT Maine has not seen any increase in its donations. "While the work of the ACLU is critical at the national level, OUT Maine's work directly influences our local climate, for youth and our communities," Dooley said. "We would love to see local people who feel energized by the election and want to help make the choice to support OUT Maine."
OUT Maine sends special thanks to the First Universalist Church in Rockland for its continuing support of OUT Maine and the work toward welcoming and affirming communities.

Medical marijuana sees growth, challenges

Texto completo: Monitor staff
Nearly three years after the New Hampshire legislature legalized medical marijuana, terminally ill cancer patient Linda Horan was able to take her first legal puff to ease her pain. But not in New Hampshire.

Horan successfully sued the state for the right to use her therapeutic cannabis card to travel to neighboring Maine and buy different strains of marijuana buds, tinctures and edibles at a Portland dispensary to help stimulate her appetite and relieve pain.
Others followed her. After Horan won her lawsuit in late 2015, the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office told the state's Department of Health and Human Services it needed to start issuing cards to qualifying patients, even though the in-state dispensaries would not open until months later.
Horan died in February in her Alstead home.
After her death, four alternative treatment centers opened their doors this spring and summer, providing a legal option for patients looking to get off strong opioids. New Hampshire moved slowly on the issue of medical marijuana; it was the last state in New England to implement its program.
State officials and alternative treatment center heads have spoken highly of their new working relationship, but the program has seen some bumps along the way.
In September, state officials said they were dealing with a backlog of therapeutic cannabis cards, with some patients waiting 40 days or more for their application to be approved. That's twice as long as the waiting period mandated by law.
Department of Health and Human Services officials said a lack of dedicated staff was contributing to the problem. In late September, state officials estimated they were getting about 20 applications per day, a drop from 35 applications per day at the busiest time.
“With the additional resources, I think by early October we'll eliminate the backlog and it will be easier to stay caught up,” John Martin, chief of the DHHS Bureau of Licensing and Certification, said at the time.
A lingering problem with the program is the refusal of some doctors to certify their patients who have a condition that qualifies them for medical marijuana. Doctors don't technically prescribe the drug to patients, but with little research on its health effects, medical experts in New Hampshire said some providers are hesitant to sign off.
For doctors accustomed to prescribing medications with exact dosages for their patients, the idea of therapeutic cannabis dispensaries can be a new frontier.
After certifying a patient has a qualifying condition, doctors are essentially putting patients in charge of their own treatment under the guidance of alternative treatment center staff.
Dispensaries offer a wide array of cannabis strains and consistencies for a range of different medical conditions.
“You're not going to have any way of knowing that before they go and pick it out,” said Dr. Stuart Glassman, physiatrist and the New Hampshire Medical Society physician representative to the state's Therapeutic Cannabis Advisory Council, in a January interview.
Another contributing factor is the fact that many New Hampshire doctors have little formal training on therapeutic cannabis.
“You have to make sure you know all the issues for a patient you might certify,” Glassman said. “We want to help our patients but not do any harm.”
In addition to the barriers some patients face accessing therapeutic cannabis, the nation's veterans face even higher hurdles.
With marijuana still illegal at the federal level, veterans who receive medical care at the VA also must jump through extra hoops to use therapeutic cannabis, needing to see other providers who can certify their conditions.
New Hampshire patients who qualify for therapeutic cannabis must be certified by a physician they've seen for at least three months, meaning veterans need to pay out of pocket to get certified.
Veterans using marijuana cannot be denied VA services after a policy directive was passed in 2011. Before then, vets who were caught using marijuana risked being kicked out of the program.
Marijuana Policy Project New Hampshire Director Matt Simon said he's been contacted by several veterans who say that getting an outside doctor is “not worth the bother, not worth the expense.”
“I think most veterans go to the VA and that's their primary source of health care,” he said.

Texto completo: On New Year's Day, I'll be packing up my car and moving out of Savannah after nearly 15 years. For the past three of those, I've been truly fortunate to get to share my experiences in Savannah's bar scene. Here are a few final recollections and recommendations from my seat at the bar.
Writing this column allowed me to meet fantastic people such as Matt Garappolo and Scott Marshall, both of whom made the switch from bartender to bar owner in 2016.
Matt and company spruced up the old Pinkie Master's location and opened The Original, re-establishing the space's rightful place as Savannah's premier neighborhood dive. There's no place I'd rather sit with friends at the end of the day, and with Evan Williams as the well bourbon, I never have to think about what I'll order.
After a series of delays, including Hurricane Matthew, Scott put the finishing touches on Alley Cat Lounge late this year, and it's already the best cocktail bar in Savannah. Featuring a virtual encyclopedia of variations on classic cocktails, Alley Cat offers a relaxed atmosphere for those who want to linger over a well-mixed drink. My favorite cocktail there so far is Remember the Maine, a fresh take on the classic Manhattan.
For every new bar that's opened, I've had to bid farewell to an old favorite. The original Pinkie's went by the wayside. Hang Fire was forced to close after complaints from Savannah's most-hated condo owners. On the corner of MLK and Congress alone, both Sparetime and Ampersand have come and gone.
Fortunately, Hang Fire's owner Wes Daniel and friends picked up shop and moved a block to the south on Whitaker Street, opening the retro-chic El-Rocko Lounge. El-Rocko continues Hang Fire's live music tradition and makes a great happy hour spot for downtown workers.
Sparetime's Jane Fishel took over as food and beverage manager at 22 Square in the Andaz Hotel on Ellis Square, where she continues to make the bar Savannah's preferred spot for high-end cocktails.
When I move, I'll miss Abe's on Lincoln and O'Connell's Irish Pub, two of my favorite places to meet up with friends. I drank too many glasses to count of Famous Grouse Scotch at Circa 1875 and Cutty Sark at Churchill's. I sampled dozens of single malt Scotches at Molly MacPherson's, which stocks one of the region's best selections. I spent too little time in new spots such as Cotton & Rye and The Vault.
Every night out downtown taught me something new about spirits. Every conversation brought me closer to the people who call Savannah home. As much as I enjoy a glass of whiskey, it's the latter that proved most important.
Savannah is my hometown, so I'll visit often enough. It's comforting to know I'll return to warm welcomes not just from family and old friends, but also to a good drink and friends I have yet to make.
Happy new year, and here's to many good years yet to come!
Zach Powers is a writer and novelist. When he's not busy imbibing, he helps run the literary arts nonprofit Seersucker Live. Get to know him at zachpowers.com.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- A shift in the track of this winter's first nor'easter was blanketed the Bangor area with up to 7 1/2 inches of snow -- nearly double an earlier prediction -- and buffeted coastal areas of Maine with winds up to 60 mph.
As the storm quieted Friday morning, approximately 114,000 homes in Maine were without power, the majority of which in York and Cumberland County. Some areas of Maine received over 20 inches of snow, according to multiple reports.
The weather service revised early snowfall predictions, which had up to 4 inches of snow falling in Bangor by noon Friday, to an expected 5 1/2 to 7 1/2 inches, said Rich Norton, a meteorologist with the weather service office in Caribou.
Bangor also was forecast to have temperatures topping out at 30 degrees and wind gusts of 30 to 35 mph before the storm passes over. The 60 mph gusts were expected in coastal areas east of Bangor, Norton said.
Snow started falling in Bar Harbor and Augusta about noon. Augusta was expected to get 2 to 4 inches of snow, with Bar Harbor's snowfall likely getting washed away by the rain expected later Thursday afternoon, Norton said.
Strong winds, with gusts of up to 60 mph, were expected to come with the storm as it barreled into coastal Hancock and Washington county areas. Some utility lines were likely to be taken out by the gusts, Norton said.
Lesser gusts of 50 mph were expected in Camden and farther south, Norton said.
The snowfall was expected to peak in colder areas as the storm tracked northwest from Bangor. Baxter State Park was forecast to get as much as 20 inches of snow. Greenville was slated for around 16 inches, and other parts of northwest Somerset and Piscataquis counties were forecast to top out at 13 inches, Norton said. Millinocket was expected to see 13 inches.
Northeastern and east central Maine, including Caribou, Dover-Foxcroft, Houlton and Lincoln, were likely to get 8 to 14 inches. Snowfall accumulations were expected to taper from that in the area from Bangor to the coast, with Washington County getting anywhere from no snow to 7 inches, officials said.
The heaviest accumulations, as much as 3 inches per hour, were expected about midnight and into early Friday.
The weather service's winter storm warning was set to expire at 11 a.m. State emergency planners warned motorists to stay off the roads and to yield to plows and emergency vehicles.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- The Kmart department store on Hogan Road is closing in mid-April as part of a company plan that "accelerated the closing of unprofitable stores," a company official said Thursday.
The number of employees to be laid off was not disclosed. A company spokesman, Howard Reifs, said that Illinois-based Kmart or parent company Sears Holdings Corp. will relocate or offer severance packages to eligible workers. Most are part-timers, Reifs said.
Reifs called the closing a "difficult, but necessary decision."
"We have been strategically and aggressively evaluating our store space and productivity, and have accelerated the closing of unprofitable stores as previously announced," Reifs said in a statement released Thursday.
The company told employees on Tuesday that it will close more than 30 Sears and Kmart stores in early 2017, starting in March, according to Business Insider. A partial list of the targeted stores compiled by the financial news website did not include the Bangor store or any other Maine Kmart or Sears locations.
Sears, which has posted a quarterly profit just once in the last four years, said in April it would close 68 Kmart discount stores and 10 Sears department stores to cut costs, according to Reuters. One of those closed Kmart discount stores was at a mall in Presque Isle.
Kmart has five stores in Maine, according to Kmart.com. They are in Auburn, Augusta, Bangor, Madawaska and Waterville.
Sears.com lists full-size department and automotive repair centers in Augusta, Bangor, Brunswick and South Portland, with Hometown stores in Belfast, Biddeford, Caribou, Ellsworth, Farmington, Fort Kent, Houlton, Newport and Windham. Hometown stores are smaller, locally owned establishments that offer many products and services, including home appliances, sporting goods, tools and consumer electronics, according to sears.com.
Kmart hopes to keep at least some of its Bangor customer relations intact with its Shop Your Way membership platform, websites and mobile apps, Reifs said.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- A group that studied Maine's biomass industry has recommended that lawmakers extend state renewable energy purchasing requirements and urged policymakers to take a broad view of the state's forest economy for ways to help.
That includes recommendations that call for broad changes to the state's energy policy that chip away at monopolies held by existing electric utilities, such as allowing permitting of electrical lines "for persons other than transmission and distribution utilities."
The broad 24-page study comes as a federal team also is studying and assessing ways to help Maine's forest products industry, which has been hit by several paper mill closures in the last five years. The biomass industry has provided loggers a market for some of their low-grade wood, while they send other wood fiber out to make into wood pulp or sawlogs.
The study urges waiting for the federal assessment team to take action, but its recommendations are specific in many parts.
The 13-member group suggested that the state both extend and expand its renewable energy purchasing requirements, adding a new class of renewable credits for heating systems. New Hampshire added renewable credits for thermal energy to its state program in 2012.
The report also suggests that lawmakers clearly extend the state's existing requirements for purchasing renewable electrical energy.
State law set a goal for 2017 and regulators expected the policy to continue indefinitely at those levels, but Maine Public reported the law does not specify that the program should continue. It also suggested the program should have incentives for electrical or thermal generation projects that have in-state economic benefits.
Those recommendations are just two of 15 from the group, which also suggested giving statewide clearance for "microgrids," which use local power generation or energy storage to prevent the need to increase the capacity of power lines delivering energy from more distant power plants.
State law and regulators have allowed such a pilot project to move ahead in Boothbay. State regulators are studying the use of microgrids to solve transmission and distribution problems in other parts of the state. Regulators have requested a law dealing with investigations of such "nontransmission alternatives" when it considers transmission line project proposals.
The report also called for encouraging installation of combined heat and power systems for schools and public institutions and for the private sector through the Efficiency Maine Trust.
The report developed five primary goals, which it identified as encouraging investment in the state's existing biomass facilities, encouraging combined heat and power installations, encouraging biomass generation on-site at manufacturing facilities, using federal grant programs and creating general policies that encourage biomass energy production.

Texto completo:   ORONO, Maine -- For nine years, Denise Card has kept a small flock of chickens in the backyard of her home in the Tough End neighborhood of Orono.
She loves "her girls" and tries to keep them safe and happy in the cold weather, which recently dipped to well below zero degrees Fahrenheit. Card provides them with high-calorie chicken scratch to help her backyard flock stay a little warmer. She has a heated water bucket and has been known to put petroleum jelly on the birds' combs, which can help prevent frostbite. She also strives to keep away the winter blues by giving them more things to do -- for example, she will hang two apples in an onion bag up high, which the birds jump up and peck at, like a pinata.
But one thing many Mainers do to keep their poultry warm in the winter -- install heat lamps in their coop -- scares her.
"There's so many people who want to heat with lights. It's just really dangerous," Card said. "Heat lamps are so dangerous. They fall over. Chickens can fly into them. Dust can get into them and can ignite. Heat lights can burn down farm buildings all the time."
Although it may be a temptation to use a heat lamp, she and other poultry aficionados say it isn't worth it. Scott DeMoranville of 4Ds Farm in Bradford has raised poultry for more than 40 years and enjoys educating others about the joys and challenges of raising backyard chickens and other birds on the Facebook page Maine Poultry Connection. During Maine's recent deep freeze, many concerned chicken owners used the page as a forum to share their concerns, tips and even photos of chickens with frostbitten combs among other things.
On the Facebook page, DeMoranville tries to make it clear that chickens are born wearing warm down coats and that responsible chicken owners don't actually need to do much more to make sure they stay safe in the winter.
"Nature has provided for those birds," he said. "You give them adequate housing and bedding for the roosts, and they don't need any heat. I tell people all the time: Think of the wild birds. They roost in a big tree. They don't have a roof over their heads. They do fine."
A 250-watt heat lamp bulb can get so hot that it can ignite an errant pine shaving or plywood, especially if a 4-plus pound chicken accidentally flies up toward it and knocked it down.
"We have a couple members of the Maine Poultry Connection that in the last five years have lost their homes to heat lamps. There's already been barn fires this year because of them."
DeMoranville recommends never using anything with a heat source in a henhouse, including a water heater.
"If people want to heat it, I suggest they put heated water outside," he said.
As for frostbite on chicken's combs, he said the best thing is to have a well-ventilated henhouse. People should clean chicken droppings out of the henhouses, with a focus on changing heavily soiled bedding. That will help reduce moisture in the coop, he said.
"For a chicken to be breathing moist air constantly is a recipe for illness," he said.
Finally, if people use artificial light in the coops to encourage their hens to lay, DeMoranville recommends waking the birds up with the artificial light but letting them go to bed with the sun. Otherwise, the plan can backfire. That's because the chickens' metabolism slows down when the sun starts to set. The birds "eat ferociously," he said, so they fill their crops to digest overnight.
"With artificial light, chickens don't know enough to fill their crops. They don't know enough to get on their roosts. It stresses them out. They go to bed hungry and ill-prepared," he said. "A bird that is stressed tends not to lay eggs."

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- A Connecticut man who escaped from a halfway house in order to sell crack cocaine in Maine got extra time tacked onto his federal sentence for his role as a "pimp" to drug-addicted Bangor women, who sold sex in exchange for drugs, U.S. Attorney Thomas Delahanty announced Thursday.
"It is bad enough to be selling drugs, but it is a different magnitude of evil to be involved in selling human beings," U.S. District Judge John Woodcock told D'Hati Coleman during his Thursday sentencing for drug dealing, according to a U.S. attorney's office press release.
Coleman, 38, of New Haven, Connecticut, sold crack cocaine to a Maine Drug Enforcement Agency informant in Bangor on Sept. 3, 2014, and was sentenced by Woodcock to two years and eight months in prison, as well as three years of supervised release once he gets out.
At the time of the Maine drug deal, which was recorded on video by Christopher Gardner, a special agent with MDEA, Coleman was a fugitive from Connecticut. He had escaped from a halfway house where he was being held on a previous drug arrest in his home state, court records show.
When Coleman sold the crack cocaine to the confidential informant in Bangor, he "spoke openly about his work as a 'pimp,'" Assistant Attorney General Joel Casey wrote in the prosecutor's version of the offense.
"The defendant went on to explain that the women did movies, pictures, sex games and that he is just trying to get 'his fair share,'" Casey states. "The defendant told the [undercover informant] that it was the world's oldest profession and most lucrative."
Also, when Coleman was arrested on Sept. 9, 2014, in New Haven, Connecticut, he was with a 28-year-old woman from Bangor who told investigators that she was selling her body for drugs.
"She admitted that she was addicted to crack cocaine and heroin," the prosecutor's version of the offense states. "She reported that [Coleman] supplied her with drugs and, in exchange, she had sex with other men who paid the defendant in cash. She was found in possession of a crack pipe."
Coleman's case is linked to another involving his cousin, Syriana Baldwin of Bangor, who was recently sentenced to 15 months in prison and three years of supervised release for his role in selling cocaine in the Bangor area. Baldwin also sold about three grams of crack for $300 to an undercover informant just two days after Coleman was recorded selling half a gram of crack to an undercover informant for $40, court records show.
A federal grand jury indicted Baldwin and Coleman for distributing crack cocaine in September 2015. Bangor attorney Charles Hodson represented both in court and did not return a message left for comment.
In addition to the MDEA, the two cases involved investigators from the New Haven, Connecticut Office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the New Haven Department of Police Services.
"Sadly, the facts described in the government's exhibits illustrate an increasingly close connection between the illegal distribution of narcotic drugs and prostitution," Casey states in the court documents.

Texto completo:   CARIBOU, Maine -- Three days before Christmas, Gary Marquis was grooming a snowmobile trail. The superintendent of the Caribou Parks and Recreation Department was just outside town filling a mudhole on Interconnected Trail System 90 near Woodland.
"We've got almost three feet of snow on the ground and the ground never had a chance to freeze with all the snow that has fallen so far. That's what the clubs are fighting right now," Marquis said on Dec. 22. "Anything in the swamps is very hard to get through right now. [Snowmobile riders] have to be very careful."
Not that Marquis was complaining. He said he and other Aroostook County snowmobilers were experiencing what Maine Snowmobile Association Executive Director Bob Meyers was hoping the rest of Maine would soon see -- a good old-fashioned winter. That means temperatures of zero to 20 degrees Fahrenheit and deep, powdery snow that melts little until springtime.
"It means cold the way we remember. It means a lot of snow and having it stay. That's the thing. When you get a great snowstorm and then it's 45 degrees and raining, it's sad," Meyers said. "Last year it never got cold, we never got much snow. There was nothing there."
National Weather Service officials said they couldn't guarantee the realization of Meyers' hopes, but Maine's 282 snowmobile clubs -- the backbone of a snowmobile industry that draws revenues of $300 million to $350 million to the state annually -- are off to a good start with the snow that's fallen and with its timing.
"To have groomed trails since two weeks ago is very rare. That is the old-style winters we used to have and to have those kinds of snow on the ground is very good," Marquis said. "It means we could have a very good season."
According to the weather service office in Caribou, as of Thursday, 49.2 inches of snow had fallen so far this winter in Caribou. That's about 16.6 inches above normal. Last year at this time, only 16.3 inches had fallen in Caribou, a good indication of how abysmal the season was, said Tim Duda, a meteorologist with the Caribou office.
"We are well ahead of where we were last year at this time," Duda said last week.
Perhaps most revealingly, the snowpack -- the amount of snow remaining on the ground after storms -- was about 18 inches in Caribou, and 15 to 20 inches across Aroostook on Thursday, said Rich Norton, meteorologist at the weather service in Caribou. Sangerville had 9 inch snowpack, Fort Kent had 12 inches and East Sangerville had 9 inches on ground. Van Buren had 13 inches.
"The best snowmobiling is obviously in Aroostook County right now," Norton said.
The Nor'easter expected to start Thursday afternoon and carry well into Friday, with accumulations of up to 16 inches expected in the northernmost parts of the state, will likely offset damage done to the snowpack by the warm weather.
Grooming in northern Penobscot County, which began last week, is off to a good start, particularly in the areas north and northwest of Millinocket, Meyers said. Areas south toward Lincoln and Bangor hadn't really gotten started with grooming yet due to minimal snow accumulations.
In Bangor, about 11.7 inches of snow had fallen as of Thursday. That's a typical amount, Duda said. Last year at this time, a piddling 4.5 inches had fallen. Much of what has hit the ground so far this year is gone, however, with the snowpack in the Bangor pretty much gone as of Thursday morning.
The hard reality for snowmobilers in the last few decades has been that winter doesn't really get going in Maine until Jan. 1 or later, and a real winter for snowmobilers is typically the kind that buries Bangor or the Maine coast in snow as well as Aroostook County.
The last good season for snowmobiling statewide, the winter of 2014-15, featured a February 2015 that was among the coldest on record. Snowfall records already had been set that month in Boston and in Eastport, and -- after tying a 46-year-old record on Feb. 9 of that year -- Bangor made the list with a new high mark for snowfall for that time of year.
Between Jan. 24 and Feb. 20 that winter, 60.8 inches fell in Bangor, surpassing the 59.4 inches that fell in Bangor between Feb. 1 and March 3, 1969. Snowfall records for Bangor have been kept since 1926, according to the National Weather Service.
Duda said the weather service hadn't any predictions for the amounts of snowfall expected next month or in February. So for now, snowmobilers, particularly those in Caribou, were happy to get on the trails while the snow was still there.
Snowmobiler Paul Henry Lessard of St. Francis said he had already put 500 miles on his new sled in just the past two weeks.
"There's not much room for improvement," Lessard said last week of trail conditions in the St. John Valley.
The New Hampshire native who now lives in St. Francis was in Fort Kent to pick up a new "Bigfoot" decal at Precision Printing and Design, which will go on his Arctic Cat sled. An avid snowmobiler, Lessard said he has ridden every winter since 1971, including many trips from Pittsburg, New Hampshire, all the way to Fort Kent.
Bob Plourde, owner of the snowmobile dealer Plourde & Plourde in Caribou and Madawaska, said people seem to be looking forward to good snowmobiling this winter.
"The main conversation last year was that we had no snow, and that it came very late," Plourde said, "but the people are very happy this year."
Plourde, who has owned the two shops since 1971, says snowmobilers were able to start riding six to eight weeks earlier this year than last.
"I think it's going to be an outstanding year for people in the snowmobile industry, motels, gas stations, and anything else associated with tourism," he said. "It affects the whole northern Maine economy since it's all we have in the winter. There's not much else going on during this time of year that generates tourism."
Meyers said the state's snowmobile trails would be impossible to maintain without the efforts of the volunteers who belong to the association's clubs -- plus 2,200 businesses that are also MSA members. The volunteers groom the state's 14,500 miles of Interconnected Trail System trails and lesser arteries. Their efforts receive about $4 million in state grants generated annually by snowmobile registry fees and a small percentage of state gas tax funds, Meyers said.
All snowmobilers, Meyers said, "should always be mindful that 95 percent of our trails are on private land. They should be respectful of that. When we have the weather, the clubs do a remarkable job doing beautiful trails."
The clubs' efforts support most all forms of Maine businesses, Meyers said, and are very well-known. His office in Augusta receives calls regularly from around North America from tourists looking to come to Maine to ride.
"I had a man from West Virginia call and Christmas morning he and his wife are hooking up the trailer and heading to Maine to go snowmobiling for a week. That's a serious commitment and it speaks volumes to the quality of the trails we offer," he said.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Opponents of the marijuana legalization initiative that passed narrowly on Maine's November ballot called Thursday on the Legislature to delay the law's implementation, leading to charges of obstructionism from legalization backers.
The call came a day after lawmakers in Massachusetts -- one of four states to vote to legalize marijuana this year -- passed a surprise six-month moratorium on its law, angering pro-marijuana forces there.
Maine's law will take effect in January and make it legal for adults 21 and older to possess 2.5 ounces of marijuana. The state will have nine months to develop rules to regulate a new market for recreational marijuana sales, which will be taxed at 10 percent.
Implementation of the law will be a signature issue for the Legislature when it returns to work next week for a session lasting through June. Legalization passed by just over 4,000 votes in November and survived a recount requested by Mainers Protecting Our Youth and Communities, the coalition of health, law enforcement and other groups that ran the anti-legalization campaign.
On Thursday, the coalition issued a statement urging lawmakers to adopt a moratorium similar to the one in Massachusetts, saying there are "many issues to grapple with when it comes to Question 1, particularly those concerning public health and the health of Maine youth" and that it may take two years to flesh out details.
"The reality is that our state and local systems are simply not prepared to regulate marijuana in a way that would truly protect our youth," said Scott Gagnon, a prevention specialist who serves as a coalition spokesman, in a statement.
But backers of the referendum said they'd oppose a moratorium. David Boyer, the Maine political director for the Marijuana Policy Project who managed the winning campaign, called the timeframe "achievable" for lawmakers and said opponents were trying to erect "roadblocks."
Paul McCarrier, president of Legalize Maine, a group that drafted the legalization bill, called it "an insult to the Maine voters and spirit of the Maine Constitution" indicating that opponents have "no interest in working with the advocates for a better cannabis policy and continue to be obstructionist."
Gov. Paul LePage, who opposed legalization, called for a delay in implementation in November and Senate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, supports a one-year moratorium.
But it's likely to run into opposition from Democrats, with House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, "not prepared to endorse a moratorium without further discussion," according to spokeswoman Mary-Erin Casale.
With or without a delay, setting rules for implementation and tweaking law around the new recreational program will be one of the biggest challenges for the new Legislature.
Attorney General Janet Mills has submitted legislation to create a "Cannabis Advisory Commission" and Thibodeau said Wednesday that he supports a new joint select legislative committee to tackle recreational marijuana in the new year.
"That is a big, big change in the culture of our state and what's acceptable, what isn't," he said.

Texto completo:   A stranger's kindness
Recently, a young man who noticed my Vietnam/Korea service hat -- that I always wear -- turned to me while standing in line at Wal-Mart and said, "Thank you for your service," and he shook my hand.
The next thing I know, after the associate bagged my purchases, I asked for the amount of the bill so I could pay. She told me, "It's all taken care of, sir." When I asked her how, she said, "The gentleman who just left paid all of it for you."
I was floored and amazed by this total stranger's kindness. I looked for him to thank him, but he was gone. I would like to thank that young man.

Drugs a societal problem
There are no words that I can utilize to inform people just how angry and frustrated I am about our attitude toward drugs. People need to open their eyes and take a stand.
I doubt there is a day that the news does not state who in the political realm is going to do this or that to rid our state of addiction. But the voters of Maine have legalized marijuana. As a very concerned Bangor resident, mom, grandma and a licensed alcohol and drug counselor, I marvel at and question our voters' choices.
It appears to me that since we cannot provide the help our society needs to rid itself of drug addiction, that we now legalize drugs, enabling the younger generation to become drug addicted as well. Instead of looking outside of ourselves for addiction solutions, let us try a little old-fashioned accountability and take control of ourselves, so we can rightfully become accountable for our societal woes.
Sherry Anderson

Fixing the criminal justice system
Eric Holder, former U.S. attorney general, once said, "I think there are too many people in jail for too long and for not necessarily good reasons."
As the newly appointed House chair of the Legislature's Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, I'm headed into the new session focused on ensuring that fewer Mainers enter the criminal justice system, and I also want to ensure that those who do enter the system get the tools they need to successfully exit it for good.
I'll work with committee members on both sides of the aisle to address the challenges that our state faces. That means providing responsible funding -- and common-sense policy -- for our criminal justice system. We need to address the fact that our county jails continue to struggle to find sustainable funding and that Maine taxpayers continue to shoulder that cost. I want to work with my colleagues to expand programs that help reduce recidivism by improving access to treatment for substance use disorder and job training opportunities to build the skills necessary to re-enter communities.
As chair of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, I will work to be a powerful force against any effort to bring back the failed war on drugs. We've come a long way in recognizing that we can't arrest our way out of the drug crisis. There is still work to do. Maine people are counting on us to protect them and their families. I look forward to the challenge and privilege of the work ahead.
Rep. Charlotte Warren
D-Hallowell
Hope is necessary
Elizabeth Printy in her Dec. 22 BDN letter to the editor missed the rest of Michelle Obama's comment about what it feels like to not have hope in her interview with Oprah Winfrey. In the same sentence, Obama went on to say that hope is necessary.
Obama closed the interview stating that her wish for the country is hope and that we find a place in our hearts to love one another. Obama does have hope, and she is encouraging all of us to have hope.

Bangor police suggest a folksy reaction to winter weather

Texto completo:   With snow falling across much of New England, police in Bangor, Maine, have some tips for locals -- but they aren't just about shoveling, keeping warm, and checking on neighbors.
A post on the department's Facebook page also outlines how locals can live up to outsiders' expectations of Mainers, should they be interviewed about the storm by reporters.
The post, which went up early Thursday morning and had been shared nearly 4,000 times by evening, includes suggestions for clothing: a hat with flaps and a sleeveless hoodie; scene setting: keep a snow shovel in the camera frame and stand near a wood pile; and diction: men should call their wives "Mother," but not pronounce the R, while women should refer not simply to "men" but to "the men-folk."
"Studies are believed to possibly show that one national interview, like that which I have described, is good for a higher percentage of tourists coming to Maine the following summer," it says.
The post was written by the department's public information officer, Sergeant Tim Cotton, who also attracted attention back in January for another witty post about winter weather.
Cotton said in an e-mail to the Globe that he wrote the lengthy post in about half an hour Wednesday night, doing it because some Facebook users check the department's page daily and send "hate mail" to him on days he doesn't post new content.
"I have found that humor is the best way to make people want to read or pay attention to anything," Cotton said. "Most of our posts are similar in nature. I call it 'kind sarcasm' (It's a thing. At least in my mind.)"
Cotton wants to make sure community members will be attentive when he has important information to share, he said, and indeed the winter weather post includes serious storm safety tips below the tongue-in-cheek advice.
"It's worked quite well and today we hit 190,000 followers on our page," Cotton said in the e-mail. "And the Chief has promised me a toaster when I hit 200 thousand. There is no better incentive than a new toaster. I think you know that."
Humor writing isn't just an unconventional facet of Cotton's police duties; he also contributes essays to CarTalk.com, the website of the long-running public radio show, including a recent piece on how to decide who gets to sit in the car's front passenger seat.
(It's a weighing of personal relationship to the driver, physical size, and the passenger's propensity for motion sickness, he suggests.)
Describing his avocation in comedy writing, Cotton was just as droll as he is in the posts he's written.
"I guess I am a wildly unsuccessful humorist," he said. "Maybe I will get that on a tattoo."

Texto completo:   SANFORD, Maine -- Maine State Police are investigating the shooting death of a well-known Maine political opinion writer at his home Wednesday evening.
Police said Michael Harmon, 71, died at his house on Brunelle Avenue when he was showing a teenage boy a handgun and the gun went off.
Harmon's daughter confirmed by phone Thursday morning that her father died Wednesday night.
The 16-year-old was handling the gun at the time, according to police.
An autopsy is scheduled at the state medical examiner's office, and the case will be reviewed by the attorney general's office.
The teenager and his father, both from North Berwick, were at the home at the time.
Detectives said everyone has been cooperating.
Harmon was employed by the Portland Press Herald for more than 41 years, beginning in 1970 as a reporter and later as an editorial writer and most recently a columnist. During his four decades, Harmon gained a reputation as one of Maine's most strident conservative voices.
Former Portland Press Herald editorial page editor John Porter said Thursday he started with Harmon as an editorial writer and later became his editor.
"Although Mike and I came from different parts of the political spectrum, we actually found a lot of common ground over the years," Porter said. "Mike liked to run up the volume on his column, as a conservative writer, but he was also very compassionate and could be a very pragmatic person as well. He always came from the right place in terms of his motives."
Harmon graduated from Bowdoin College, and served for 25 years in the U.S. Army Reserve, including two years of active duty in Vietnam. He retired as a lieutenant colonel.
Porter said Harmon was proud of his military service and "carried that part of his life with him always. When we would talk about issues, he would always talk about the importance of honoring veterans and making sure people understood how difficult it is for people to serve."
Harmon retired from journalism in 2011, but he continued to work as a freelance writer and speaker. As news of his death became public Thursday morning, messages of condolence to his family and colleagues at Maine Today Media poured in from throughout the state.
According to the Portland Press Herald, Harmon is survived by his wife, three children, two stepchildren and several grandchildren.

Texto completo:   Winter in Maine has started out with roller coaster temperatures, snow, rain and everything in between, which makes planning outdoor activities tricky, especially when it comes to anything involving ice. Skating, fishing, snowmobiling and skiing on ponds and lakes requires caution and know-how, especially early in the season, when ice is just starting to thicken.
"From year to year, especially with recent weather patterns, things are all over the place," Maine Game Warden Jim Fahey, who serves Greater Bangor, said. "Compared to a year ago, we are further ahead [in ice thickness throughout the state]."
But don't let this fact lull you into a false sense of confidence. Ice conditions vary throughout the state. To help people navigate these dangerous waters, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife releases monthly ice fishing reports throughout the winter, and these reports include firsthand knowledge from state biologists about ice conditions throughout the state.
Where to find ice
The first report of the season was released on Dec. 22. In it, the DIF&W announced that ice fishing was already underway throughout the state.
"There are a lot of people out already, and there is more than a couple of inches of ice on the smaller ponds," DIF&W fisheries biologist Jim Pellerin from the Sebago Lakes Region said in the report. "A lot of the bigger lakes are still open in the middle, but the shoreline and coves have frozen over."
The ice fishing report provides suggestions for specific bodies of water by region where fishing may be good and even provides information about the species and size of fish being caught in those places.
For example, if you're looking for trout in the midcoast area, DIF&W fisheries biologist Jason Seiders suggests ice fishing on Levenseller Pond in Searsmont or Dutton Pond in Knox, which are stocked with brook trout that range in size from 10 to nearly 20 inches. In the Moosehead Region, DIF&W fisheries biologist Tim Obrey suggests Fitzgerald, Prong and Shirley ponds for early-season fishing.
In general, warm, shallow ponds tend to ice over first, Fahey said, while the deep, cold lakes take longer. In Greater Bangor, for example, ponds such as Pushaw, Hermon and Perch were reported to have up to 10 inches of ice in mid-December, while big lakes including Phillips, Green and Branch had thinner ice and were still open water in some places.
"Every year can be different," Fahey said. "The rule of thumb is to not assume anything. Check for yourself. Certainly inquire about the ice at local bait shops and people who live around the body of water, welcome all resources, but it's your individual responsibility to check the ice."
Checking the thickness of ice with a chisel or ice auger is key to ensuring the ice is safe for walking, skiing, fat-tire biking, skating or driving on.
The Maine Warden Service provides the following ice thickness guidelines, which are for new, clear, solid ice:
-- If the ice is 2 inches thick or less, stay off it
-- 4 inches may allow ice fishing or other activities on foot
-- 5 inches often allows for snowmobile or ATV travel
-- 8 inches to 12 inches of good ice will support most cars or small pickups
-- 12 inches to 15 inches will likely hold a medium size truck
"If you don't see tracks across the lake, there's probably a reason why," Fahey said.
It's important to keep in mind that ice doesn't form uniformly across a body of water. The thickness of the ice can change dramatically in just a few feet for a variety of reasons. A water current, especially near streams, bridges and culverts, often makes ice thin and dangerous. Also, objects protruding from the water, such as large boulders and beaver lodges, can absorb and produce heat, causing the surrounding ice to be thinner. And perhaps most surprisingly, the movement of fish can actually stir up warm water from the bottom of a lake. In the past, this has opened holes in the ice that snowmobiles and cars have broken through, according to the DIF&W.
Breaking through ice
The Maine Warden Service responds to emergency calls every winter that involve people, pets and vehicles crashing through the ice and plunging into frigid ponds and lakes throughout the state. Often, these accidents could have been easily avoided.
"I heard there was a Subaru car on Plymouth Pond [in Penobscot County] the other day," Fahey said. "That's just not prudent. Even if they had cut and found sufficient ice, the ice wasn't uniform across the whole pond. That puts themselves at risk and puts everyone who is a rescue responder at risk."
In addition to offering ice thickness guidelines, the Maine Warden Service provides tips for rescuing people who've fallen through ice, as well as guidelines for escaping a vehicle that has crashed through ice. This information is available on the official State of Maine website, maine.gov, and includes the "preach, reach, throw, row, go" method of rescue.
"People have to use good judgment in how they approach someone that appears to be in distress," Fahey said. "Use what is at hand to reach them, like a tree branch or snow shovel, so you don't put yourself on the edge of the ice."
A throw-bag containing rope is one useful piece of gear that Fahey suggests people carry while on or near ice this winter. It could mean the difference between saving someone and waiting for helping to arrive.
Ice picks are also great tools for ice safety, especially self-rescue scenarios, when they can be used to grip slippery ice and pull yourself out of the water before the onset of hypothermia.
"I commonly carry mine in the front pocket and always in the same place," Fahey said. "I've made them before out of an old broom handle and a nail, but the commercial type has a plastic sheath that protects you from the pick."
A whistle can also be useful.
"You can blow a whistle longer and louder than you could ever yell," Fahey said. "And it's a universal sound of distress."
Before every outdoor adventure, Fahey suggest to leave an itinerary with someone at home telling them where you're going and when you plan to return. That way, if you don't return, wardens know where to start their search. This is even more important in the winter, when harsh weather conditions can make outdoor survival more challenging.

Texto completo:   THORNDIKE, Maine -- For years, John Palumbo and Nyla Bravesnow roamed around Maine, trying to find just the right place to set down their roots.
A decade ago, after many false starts and dashed hopes from southern Maine to the Down East coast, the couple, by then toting an infant son, finally found it: 8 acres of sloping, rocky former pasture land and a small stand of ash trees they have turned into Many Hands Farm. It was a relief, Bravesnow said.
"This was my 39th move," she said from inside her home on a bright and sunny December day. "It just felt so good to be here."
In the years since, the family and the farm have blossomed, though not entirely in the traditional ways people usually mark success.
Bravesnow and Palumbo have three mischievous, home-schooled sons -- Jonah, 9, Ara, 4, and Kai, 2 -- but they do not own a car, truck or tractor. In fact, they have lived without owning a vehicle for six years, which wasn't so hard in Portland, with its public transportation system, but has posed more of a challenge in rural Waldo County. At one point, Palumbo rode his bicycle nearly 20 miles to get to work at a downtown Belfast restaurant, even in the winter.
Now Bravesnow and Palumbo stay closer to home and said that while life at Many Hands Farm is busy and rewarding, those rewards usually are not the financial kind.
"We've been living on between $10,000 and $15,000 for 11 or 12 years," Palumbo said.
That small sum, which is largely generated by taking in Airbnb guests and selling vegetables, goats, flowers and the herbal remedies and other products sold on the family's Etsy store, is well below the federal poverty level. Yet they wouldn't change their lives, which they believe are rich in other ways than money.
"We really like to share," Bravesnow said. "We give food. We give time to other people. I believe in passing it on, and that is how we live. I think there's something about that that creates abundance."
Searching for their own 'good life'
On the farm, they have built several structures, including the cozy, 432-square-foot house where the five of them live. Entering their home felt a little like walking into a fairy tale or maybe a treehouse. It was full of a cacophony of good smells, including the homemade herbal tea Palumbo was brewing and the lard from the hog they slaughtered the day before that was gently rendering on their small, green woodstove.
As Palumbo, 39, worked in the small kitchen making apple and cheddar fritters, he was helped by Ara, who proudly grated fistfuls of cheese. Bravesnow, 42, cuddled Kai, as she and her husband talked about their long journey to find home.
Bravesnow grew up north of Caribou and Palumbo came from Long Island, New York. They met 18 years ago at the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies in Rhinebeck, New York. After living in California, they slowly made their way back to the East Coast and then Maine, because they wanted to farm. But there were detours on their way to becoming farmers. They settled for a while in Portland, where Palumbo was a substance abuse counselor at a methadone clinic and Bravesnow worked as a nanny.
At that time, they had a combined income of $55,000 per year but were so busy working they "never saw each other," Bravesnow said. They went out to eat a lot because they didn't have time to cook. And when they started looking at houses to buy, the market was so pricey they envisioned a future where they were stuck on the 9-to-5 treadmill forever.
It wasn't for them. So they jumped off and made a few changes. He became a kindergarten teaching assistant, and she quit her full-time job, too. In a flash, their combined income plummeted from $55,000 to $10,000, yet they felt richer. They had more time, for one thing, and they practiced carefully tracking their spending, so they knew where each dollar went. After that, the couple embarked more ambitiously on figuring out where to farm in Maine.
"We were trying to find a community -- to go in and buy land together so we can avoid going into debt," she said. "And living creatively to make ends meet."
At one point, they were part of a group that was going to buy a parcel of land they loved in Penobscot. When they were stymied by a right-of-way issue, the group fell apart. Then, the couple applied to be stewards of the Good Life Center in Harborside but found themselves the runners-up after a rigorous application process. It was disappointing, but they kept on with their search.
"We used Maine FarmLink [through the Maine Farmland Trust]. We used Uncle Henry's. We tried everything," Bravesnow said.
Jonah was born when they were living in a 120-square-foot shed in Unity, which they found after answering an ad in the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association newspaper that offered a creative land-sharing situation. Bravesnow was ready to build her nest, she said, and longed to expand the garden space at the property and build a larger home, but the landowner wasn't ready for those changes.
"That's when I got pretty depressed," she said. "And then we found this place."
'We started growing everything'
The land in Thorndike would not have been good for conventional farmers -- it was too hilly -- but for two people interested in permaculture farming, it had a lot of potential. Permaculture has been described as a way of working with nature rather than against it, and some of its tenets include mimicking natural processes and patterns and repairing soil without the use of chemical fertilizers. Bravesnow and Palumbo had a farming mentor, who came with a shovel and dug up a patch of soil on the property. It was full of earthworms, Bravesnow recalled -- a sight that made her glad.
"It was very good soil," she said. "We started growing everything. All the vegetables and a lot of the fruits."
They added animals, including a flock of heritage chickens, Welsh Harlequin ducks, American Buff geese, Nigerian Dwarf dairy goats, American guinea hogs and rabbits, as well as medicinal herbs and many flowers. In the summer, Bravesnow's garden is bright with the edible flowers she sells at the Unity Food Hub and to Trillium Caterers of Belfast.
And they began meeting their neighbors, including organic and conventional farmers, newcomers, old-time Mainers and the Amish community. In fact, many locals have confused Bravesnow and Palumbo for members of the Amish community because they, too, eschew automobiles. At times when Bravesnow and Palumbo needed help, they have received it, both from their community and from state and federal assistance programs. They built their house with the help of friends and neighbors and receive fuel assistance that helps provide their firewood and SNAP, the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Their property features several small, handmade wooden structures, the largest of which they live in. Other buildings host the Airbnb guests who have come to stay with them in the summer for the last three years or so. That is how they have made the bulk of their income, they said.
"We've met so many people that way," Bravesnow said. "We have a rich community that's connected all over the world."
One rustic but charming cabin, where Airbnb guests sleep during the summer, is the location of their winter farm dinners. The dinners will feature vegetarian dishes, using produce mostly grown locally, in exchange for a suggested donation of $20 to $30 per person.
Sample menus include handmade basil-flecked egg noodles in a lemon butter melange, roasted shallots on winter greens, watermelon radish crudite and apple cobbler.
"John and I love food," Bravesnow said. "On food, I won't compromise. That's my health insurance."
They love to prepare and share good food with others and also like the idea of a new income stream for the farm.
"This time of year gets very lean for us," Bravesnow said. "We think of creative ways to have more income."
Although there are challenges to living the way they do, they are grateful for the life they have.
"I love all of it," Bravesnow said. "It's what I played when I was 4 [years old]. I played homestead. I loved 'Little House on the Prairie.' I wanted to have a purposeful life. I wanted to help people, and we do."
Palumbo, who in the course of a normal day might wear the hats of a woodworker, a farmer, a homeschool teacher, a chef and a butcher, said he enjoys the variety and the cohesiveness of his life.
"I love all the parts of it," he said. "I love the spiritual connection of it and how it all goes together."
Bravesnow said that in many ways the couple has applied permaculture principles to their lives and their finances as well as their farm.
"It works really well," she said. "We just go with the flow. There's not a lot of extra, but there keeps being enough."

Texto completo:   I want to take the time to thank the anti-Trump demonstrators for their civility as they greeted the elector for Maine's 2nd Congressional District, outgoing Maine GOP Chair Rick Bennett, and his supporters, of which I was one. With the organizers' Facebook pages encouraging protesters to stop Maine's only Trump elector "by any means necessary," it was far from the only possible outcome, particularly in light of recent, more aggressive protests in Portland.
Maine has once again demonstrated itself to be above the fray which much of the rest of the nation seems to plunge itself into. It set the example that citizens can disagree very strongly, and yet remain respectful, remembering that at the end of the day they are still neighbors and fellow citizens of Maine and our country. The people did not buy the violent rhetoric of the Left, but this violent rhetoric does not cease to be a problem. The level of division in the nation today is not unprecedented, but it is a greater division than we have had since the 1970s.
What was unprecedented, however, was the level of engagement in the political process. This was the first election cycle followed by so many people through every stage of the process, and never before has the electorate been so widely educated about our election process. America, and the world, followed this election cycle as they would a Netflix series.
And indeed we elected a reality TV star, a huge personality whose novelty made the cautious, pandering, image-consulted, focus group approved politicians seem simultaneously shallow, hollow, and dishonest. Not only did Donald Trump say whatever was on his mind, he doubled down on whatever fell from his jowls or fingertip at any given time. And he did it so well, so beautifully, that the media was compelled to obsessively cover whatever 140 character emission he happened to toss out at 2 a.m. that day, giving him non-stop media coverage without his spending a dime.
While the media was misreading already skewed polls about how wonderful Hillary's campaign was doing, Trump was packing crowds that overflowed the doors of stadiums around the block.
Just when the Left thought they had won the cultural war, Trump, who embraced and branded his own absurdity, made it utterly impossible to take the Left seriously whatsoever. Trump understood how to use social media just as FDR understood how to utilize radio. It was no coincidence that in the age when the opinionated masses found their voice and stride, the man who understood how to use the media platforms driving it would find himself at the top.
What is significant, however, is that the man figured out the significance and power of the platform, and how to harness it. He kept everyone glued to all forms of media just to see what would happen next. He confronted the right-wing establishment, baffled the establishment Left, manipulated the media, and struck terror into the heart of post-modernist liberalism. He beat the left at their own game using their Alinskyan tactics in new and novel ways.
Trump's showmanship and his off-the-cuff air of confidence, no matter how ridiculous, dominates all attention. He may have the mannerisms of a drunken buffoon who accidentally found himself the most powerful man in the world, but had he been a typical candidate, no one would have really cared. He developed and played a caricature of himself while driving the entire narrative surrounding him. He turned the election into a series of cliffhangers and plot twists. That is why the Left engaged so thoroughly in this election and why they learned enough about the system to suggest that electors "vote their conscience."
And that they did. In the end, more switched their vote from Hillary than switched their vote from Trump, because Hillary never drove the narrative further than any of the GOP primary contestants did. It was Trump's Wagnerian performance -- and not dedication to their candidate -- that ensured the Left was educated enough about their political system to attempt to sway our electors peacefully.
The left's sudden love for Hamilton, traditionally a figure reviled by the left, was able to culminate in the "Hamilton Electors," who the left hoped they could get to defect in the name of fighting Trump's populism, with the justification that Hillary won by popular vote. Had they not pursued this last ditch effort, not only would the narrative course of the election have been less interesting, but the nation would not be so familiar with the history and process of the election system.
So, again, to the anti-Trump demonstrators, thank you for participating in this year's election.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- A new measure of Maine's economic well-being from Husson University shows the end of the year is looking up for the state -- at least, for its publicly traded companies.
The university's business school has selected 28 companies with headquarters or operations in the state and created its Husson Stock Index to track the standing of those companies with investors.
By the end of the year, the index was up to an all-time high, led by a strong rise in bank stock prices at Bar Harbor Bankshares and Bank of America.
Investors trade shares of seven Maine-based companies, but many more that are closely scrutinized by investors and analysts have an impact on the state's economy.
Those companies include Bangor Gas owner Gas Natural Inc., Hannaford owner Delhaize Group and other national retailers with a presence in the state, including Home Depot and Lowe's.
"The companies in this price-weighted index are either based in Maine or have an influence on our state's economy through employment, the number of consumers they serve, or their overall presence," said associate professor J. Douglas Wellington in a press release. "When combined with analysis, this measurement tool provides students with a better understanding of Maine's business climate."
The seven Maine-based companies in the index are Idexx, in Westbrook; Wex, in South Portland; ImmuCell, in Portland; Camden National Bank; Bar Harbor Bankshares; First Bancorp, in Damariscotta; and Northeast Bancorp, in Lewiston.
The other companies include: athenahealth, Colgate-Palmolive, Darden Restaurants, General Dynamics, Hilton, McDonald's, Penn National Gaming, PepsiCo, Rite Aid, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Time Warner Cable, UPS, Unum, Valero and Wal-Mart.

Texto completo:   WAUSAU - Deputy Dan D'Acquisto felt an instant rapport with his new partner when they first met in Indiana.
"It's kind of hard to explain," D'Acquisto said. "I just knew he was the one."
His new colleague is Monty, an 18-month-old Belgian malinois, the fourth dog to join the Marathon County Sheriff's Department K-9 unit. Chief Deputy Chad Billeb introduced D'Acquisto and Monty to the public at a news conference Wednesday morning. At the same time, Billeb honored Donald and Connie Huehnerfuss, a town of Maine couple who donated money to purchase and train Monty.
There are four dogs and handlers in the Marathon County Sheriff's K-9 unit, and the care and training of the animals is paid through donations, not tax dollars, Billeb said. The purchase of a police dog and training is about $17,000.
Monty, like his other pawed colleagues, will be used to search for narcotics and help make arrests. He also has been trained to track missing people.
D'Acquisto and Monty trained together for six weeks in Indiana at the Vohne Liche Kennels, which specializes in training police dogs. The partners are with each other all of the time; when off duty, Monty lives with D'Acquisto and his pet bulldog.
"They get along great," D'Acquisto said.
D'Acquisto has been with the Sheriff's Department since 2012, working first in the Marathon County Jail. He's been in the patrol division for about two years, and he always wanted to become a police dog handler. He and Monty have been on patrol since Dec. 22.
"I always have a partner with me," D'Acquisto said.
"He's always excited and loves to do his job. And he's always willing to please me, which is a great tool to have."
Billeb presented Donald and Connie Huehnerfuss at Civilian Community Service Award for their donation. They're dog people, and said they believed in the work of the Sheriff's Department.
"It's just good for the community," Donald said. "I had heard that they wanted a fourth dog, and we felt this would be a good thing to do."

Avalanche watch issued for Mount Washington area

Texto completo:   An avalanche watch is in effect for areas around Tuckerman's Ravine on Mount Washington as northern New England faces a powerful storm expected to bring 18 inches or more of snow to all three states.
The avalanche watch, issued by the Mount Washington Avalanche Center, is in effect from noon Thursday until midnight on Friday.
The watch targets "the Cutler River drainage on the east side of Mount Washington including forecast areas in Tuckerman and Huntington ravines," according to the National Weather Service. "Watch criteria may be met in other areas outside those forecast by the avalanche center."
The reason for the concern is the "potent winter storm" arriving mid-day Thursday, which will bring 18 inches of snow -- and maybe even more in some areas -- to New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont.
High winds accompanying the storm will crease "unstable wind slabs" of snow and forecasters are warning anyone heading into the backcountry on Thursday to be prepared for dramatic changes in weather conditions.
By Friday, forecasters note, the combination of heavy snow, strong winds and cold temperatures should keep the prudent out of the backcountry all together. "Backcountry travel may become very dangerous and not recommended on Friday," forecasters wrote. "Due to continued wind loading of steep slopes, elevated avalanche danger is likely to remain on Saturday."
Staying close to home won't be easy for most people in Northern New England later Thursday.
Snowfall totals range from a foot in Jaffrey in Southern New Hampshire to 18 inches in Jackman in northern Maine -- and some areas could get nearly two feet depending on localized conditions.
"The jackpot still appears to be in the mountains and foothills [of New Hampshire and Maine] where up to 2 feet of snow may fall," forecasters wrote.
In Vermont, forecasters say snow will begin across the region late Thursday morning, and become heavy at times by late this afternoon and tonight. Snowfall will reach 16 inches, and possibly nearly two feet, by the storm's end, forecasters said.

Today's fast-moving storm will set up an epic skiing weekend

Resumen: Today New England will be hit by a fast-moving storm that will end up being a classic interior snowstorm for much of ski country and a much-needed rainstorm for the many other areas. Areas around Worcester will see a very wide range in snow totals. Since the rain-snow line will be nearby during the storm, you could go from an inch to over 6 inches of snow in a very short distance.

Texto completo:   Today New England will be hit by a fast-moving storm that will end up being a classic interior snowstorm for much of ski country and a much-needed rainstorm for the many other areas. Between the rain and the snow, a sloppy mess is forecast, with heavy wet snow.
I think if you asked 100 people around Boston what was the perfect snowstorm, many would say one that rains in the city but brings a lot of snow for skiers. The northern ski areas of New Hampshire and Maine will see 10 to 20 inches of snow later Thursday and into the first few hours of Friday. This will set up an epic skiing weekend there.
The storm will bring rain to much of southern New England. This doesn't mean it won't start and end as snow in the Route 128 corridor or even that folks in Boston might not see a few flakes early and late in the storm, but rain is the main player for the more urban centers of eastern Massachusetts.
The map below shows how much snow I am expecting. Areas around Worcester will see a very wide range in snow totals. Since the rain-snow line will be nearby during the storm, you could go from an inch to over 6 inches of snow in a very short distance.
The storm will be rapidly intensifying on its way up to Maine, and this will cause winds to increase. As the storm becomes stronger, the falling pressure creates more wind. This is nature's way of balancing the atmosphere. The more rapid the pressure change over a short distance and time, the faster the wind. This will be the case for a few hours tonight when winds will be strongest. A wind advisory is posted for Maine's eastern areas.
The black lines around the storm are called isobars, and the closer together these lines are, the more wind there is.
The precipitation will start late this morning, between 9 and noon, and end late this evening, between 9 and midnight. As you can see, this will be about a 12-hour window of rain and snow. The snow will fall at rates exceeding 1 inch per hour across far northern Worcester County, parts of northern Franklin County, and perhaps even the northwest corner of Middlesex County.
When you wake up Friday, the sun will shine and temperatures won't be very cold. I expect highs tomorrow in the upper 30s to lower 40s, quite seasonable for the time of year.
Saturday is also dry and chilly. There may be some rain or snow showers on New Year's Eve. This won't be a big deal and the timing is still unsure. The first day of 2017 dawns bright and sunny with no big cold in sight.

Texto completo:   Maine home sales jump in November
One Maine real estate agent says the only thing holding back the market is lack of inventory.
Maine home sales jumped and prices shot up as well in November.
The Maine Real Estate Information System reported that 1,414 homes changed hands last month, an increase of 17.74 percent over the 1,201 homes that sold in November 2015. Prices were up as well, to a statewide median of $191,863, compared to $180,000 in November 2015. That's an increase of 6.59 percent.
Both indicators are in line with regional and national trends, showing strong residential sales closing out 2016. Nationally, existing homes jumped 16.2 percent since last November. The National Association of Realtors also reported a 6.8 percent rise of the national median sales price to $236,500. The Northeast region experienced a 15.7 percent increase in sales while the median price was up 3.3 percent to $263,000.
Brenda Fontaine of Fontaine Family real estate said she senses that a lot of momentum has built up in the Maine housing market that will carry on past the holidays.
"It's been a great year and I think next year will also be a great year," said Fontaine, whose firm has offices in Auburn and Scarborough.
Fontaine said the only thing holding back the market, particularly in the Lewiston-Auburn area, is a lack of inventory. That means there are often multiple offers on houses for sale, which explains the higher prices, she said.
Fontaine said interest rates on mortgages have inched up as the year has gone on, but they are still low by historical standards and that will help fuel the market. She said buyers who can get a state or federally backed housing loan can still find rates below 4 percent, which makes houses affordable to more people.
Next year, Fontaine said, she expects to see more buyers moving up to larger houses. After years of staying in the same house because of the market collapse six or seven years ago, she said, many families may find that prices have recovered enough that it's a good time to sell and step up to a larger house.
REGIONAL VARIATIONS
The strength of the housing market varied around the state. Three counties - Waldo, Cumberland, and Washington - reported a decline in the number of sales during the September to November quarter, compared to the same three months in 2015. In Waldo, and Cumberland counties, the declines were modest at 0.69 percent and 1.01 percent, respectively, but in Washington County, the decline was sharper, at 8.5 percent. But in raw numbers, rather than percentages, that was a minor reduction, reflecting a decline from 105 homes sold in during the quarter last year compared to 96 sold during the same three months this year.
Aroostook County recorded the sharpest increase in home sales during the quarter, from 123 last year to 175 this year, a rise of 44.28 percent. Oxford and Penobscot counties also reported sharply higher sales during the quarter.
On the price side, the biggest jump in median prices during the quarter was in Knox County, where the median sales price increased from $187,250 to $222,250, an increase of 18.69 percent. Most other counties saw increases of around 7 or 8 percent.
The only decline in median price was in Aroostook County, where the median price during the September-November quarter slipped from $84,000 last year to $83,000 this year.
Sales were especially strong in Massachusetts, according to The Associated Press.
It reported that the Boston-based Warren Group reported that the 5,061 single-family homes sold in the state last month was the highest November sales amount since 1998 and a 26 percent increase over the same month last year.
The Massachusetts Association of Realtors, meanwhile, reported that November recorded the most closed sales for the month on record.
Both organizations also reported an increase in median prices of about 5 to 6 percent - up to $365,000 according to the Realtors and up to $349,000 according to The Warren Group. The groups use different numbers in their calculations. Edward D. Murphy can be contacted at 791-6465 or at: emurphy@pressherald.com

Texto completo:   OAKLAND -- Oakland has become one of the first communities in Maine to adopt an ordinance prohibiting the retail sale of marijuana and the establishment of marijuana social clubs.
The 5-0 Town Council vote Wednesday does not prohibit the legal use and cultivation of marijuana as approved by Maine voters in November, Oakland Town Manager Gary Bowman said before Wednesday's Town Council meeting.
Eric Conrad, director of communication and educational services at the Maine Municipal Association, said Oakland's vote to ban sales and clubs "is either first or right up there" in Maine. Other communities have approved moratoriums so they can consider zoning and other issues concerning such establishments.
"I can't guarantee that there's not some town somewhere, but I just talked to our head lawyer and she said, and I agree, that there aren't many that are this far along in a prohibition yet," Conrad said. "As far as we're concerned, if they're not the first, they're one of the very first."
One resident Wednesday night said she is a medical marijuana caregiver and objects to a permanent ban.
"I have a big problem with the word 'prohibition,' " Andrea Thomas told council members. "We're not all just stupid stoners. There's a lot of people in this community who need this."
Council Chairman Michael Perkins said the board simply was "erring on the side of caution" until the state figures out how to regulate the law. He said the town can revisit the question of a total ban if residents petition to do so.
Thomas countered that there are bars and liquor stores in Oakland that no one seems to mind. She said alcohol consumption is far worse than marijuana use.
Councilor Don Borman pointed out that Oakland was once a "dry town" banning sales of hard liquor, but that was reversed after residents petitioned for the change.
The marijuana law, approved Question 1 in a state referendum by about 4,000 votes, allows towns to regulate the number, location and operation of retail marijuana stores, cultivation, manufacturing and testing facilities and social clubs, and also can impose local licensing requirements. They also can become dry towns by implementing an outright ban on all marijuana business, which is what Oakland did Wednesday night.
Private marijuana possession and growing will still be allowed even in towns that ban retail businesses. The ordinance does not affect medical marijuana or personal use of recreational marijuana.
The Maine law allows adults 21 and older to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana, grow their own plants and buy marijuana from licensed retail stores. The initiative also allows marijuana social clubs and imposes a 10 percent sales tax on marijuana. Marijuana use will be prohibited in public, with violations punishable by a $100 fine.
Marijuana is still illegal under federal law. It remains to be seen whether LePage or President-elect Donald Trump will take steps to block or roll back laws in Maine and seven other states that have legalized recreational marijuana use.
Oakland residents voted 1,914-1,620 against Question 1.
Oakland councilors took the route of becoming a "dry town" rather than implementing a moratorium and local restrictions. Bowman told councilors last month that because the town's comprehensive plan isn't updated and the town doesn't have zoning, it can't enforce a moratorium.
Skowhegan selectmen in November decided to pursue becoming a dry town after residents voted 2,152-1,897 against Question 1. The Planning Board is developing an ordinance to ban marijuana businesses that will likely go to voters at the annual Town Meeting in June.
If Skowhegan residents decide not to become a dry town, officials will ask them to implement a moratorium to allow town officials time to figure out how to handle marijuana businesses. Skowhegan has a local controlled-substance facility ordinance in place regulating methadone clinics and medical marijuana dispensaries, but town officials said it is unclear if the town can use the same ordinance to regulate recreational marijuana businesses.
In Madison, Town Manager Tim Curtis said Wednesday that after taking input from residents during a Dec. 19 public hearing, selectmen have scheduled a special town meeting for Jan. 9 to vote on imposing a 180-day moratorium on marijuana retail sales and social clubs.

Texto completo:   Husson University has created a stock index to track the financial performance of companies that most directly impact Maine's economy. Calculated by students on a weekly basis when classes are in session, the index provides both a numerical benchmark and an opportunity for understanding market movement. Students can look at current events and determine their impact on stock valuations. The analysis is part of an educational experience where students increase their understanding of stocks and why prices fluctuate. When combined with analysis, the measurement tool provides students with a better understanding of Maine's business climate.
Husson University has created a stock index to track the financial performance of companies that most directly impact Maine's economy.
Calculated by the Bangor-based university's students on a weekly basis when classes are in session, the Husson Stock Index aggregates the stock prices of 28 publicly traded companies with strong ties to Maine. A few are headquartered in the state, but most either employ a large number of Mainers or sell products the state relies on heavily.
While the index has yet to prove itself as a reliable economic indicator, it has greatly benefited the university's business students by giving them their own real-time stock index to work with, said J. Douglas Wellington, associate professor of finance at Husson's School of Business and Management.
"It helps connect students to the companies in Maine, to investing and to the stock market as a whole," Wellington said.
The index provides both a numerical benchmark and an opportunity for understanding market movement, he said. Students go through a weekly exercise of looking at current events and determining their impact on stock valuations.
The analysis is part of an educational experience for students to increase their understanding of stocks and why prices fluctuate. When combined with analysis, the measurement tool provides students with a better understanding of Maine's business climate.
"The companies in this price-weighted index are either based in Maine or have an influence on our state's economy through employment, the number of consumers they serve, or their overall presence," Wellington said.
The index initially was proposed and co-developed, along with Wellington, by former Husson student Marie Heath. Today, Heath is a finance manager in the University's Office of Financial Services.
"We really looked at presence in the state, and do they have a large amount of employees," Heath said. "We also tried to be really diverse with multiple types of industries that we have in the index."
Husson College of Business Dean Marie Hansen said the index was born out of Husson's Center for Financial Technology, which opened in 2014. Knowing that many Husson students are from Maine and plan to continue working in the state, Wellington was interested in finding a way to give students a personal stake in the financial markets. Heath's idea seemed like a great solution.
"There are not a voluminous number of companies that emanate from the state of Maine, but they have touches within the state of Maine," Hansen said.
Examples include Valero Energy Corp., which is based in San Antonio, Texas, but has a large presence in Maine through its dozens of fueling stations. Another is Colgate-Palmolive Co., the New York-based conglomerate that purchased a controlling 84 percent stake in Tom's of Maine for $100 million in 2006.
"Maine does indeed have a great influence and connection to public companies," Hansen said. "There are things that we can measure right here within the state of Maine."
Wellington said the next phase of the Husson Stock Index project will be to measure how accurately the index functions as a real-time indicator of Maine's economic activity. He said the business college plans to tackle that challenge within the coming year.
Husson's business college is among the state's largest with about 1,500 actively enrolled students.

Texto completo:   An advance looking at significance of large mid-season wrestling tournaments at Noble (this Thursday and Friday) and next weekend at Sanford.
Last year when Skowhegan High won the Noble Invitational wrestling tournament, edging Noble, Foxcroft Academy and four-time defending Class A champion Marshwood, it was a sign of things to come.
Skowhegan went on to win its first Class A title and Foxcroft won Class B.
"Winning Noble was obviously a big milestone because we had never won that and it showed the kids that the idea of winning a state title was a real possibility," said Brooks Thompson, Skowhegan's co-head coach with Tenney Noyes.
"If we could win one of the toughest tournaments in the state, definitely the toughest that we go to, then we could beat the Marshwoods and the Nobles at the state tournament."
The 35th annual Noble Invitational begins Thursday and ends Friday. Wrestling starts each day at 9:30 a.m. The tournament will proceed regardless of weather. A significant winter storm is predicted to start Thursday night and stretch into Friday morning.
"If they want to, teams can come down here and spend the night in the gym," Noble Coach Kip DeVoll said. "It will be a lot cheaper than staying in a hotel and it will be one of those things they'll remember and talk about no matter what they do in the tournament."
The Noble tournament, and next weekend's Spartan Invitational in Sanford, typically reveal which teams and individuals are in the top echelon in Maine.
"Usually the team that wins (the Noble) tournament wins at states and the highest (Class) B team wins at their states. It is a good indicator," DeVoll said.
Up to 32 schools - most from Maine and including teams from New Hampshire and Vermont - are expected to compete at Noble. Skowhegan is back to defend its title, though the host Knights are favored. Marshwood is not attending. The Hawks went instead to the 72-team Lowell (Massachusetts) Invitational that ended Wednesday.
On Jan. 6-7, the Spartan Invitational will bring top out-of-state programs, including Timberlane, New Hampshire, and Danbury, Connecticut, along with Marshwood to Sanford. The Spartan tournament has fewer teams (Noble will be at a tourney in Chelmsford, Massachusetts) but plenty of top-end talent. In 2016, just four of the 14 weight classes were won by Maine wrestlers.
The value of the large midseason tournaments is "you're in a bigger pool of talent so some of your better kids are going to get more competitive matches," said Marshwood Coach Matt Rix. "And if they seed it properly, even your less talented kids are going to get a win out of it."
The invitational tournaments can also be a place for young wrestlers to make a name for themselves.
That's what Marshwood senior Bradley Beaulieu did at the Noble tournament his freshman year. He pulled off a last-second takedown to a near-fall to score five points and force overtime against then unbeaten Peter Del Gallo of Gardiner, a reigning New England champion. Del Gallo ended up winning 12-9 in the second overtime but Beaulieu showed the skill and competitiveness that has led him to three Class A titles, two top-three finishes at the New England championships and a college scholarship to Old Dominion.
Noble senior Austin Shorey cemented himself among the state's elite as a sophomore with his invitational efforts. He beat three-time state champ Tyler Craig of Skowhegan in the Noble semifinals, then won the 120-pound title and was named the outstanding wrestler at the Sanford tournament.
"After I beat (Craig) I felt I could beat anybody and I started to wrestle like I could beat anybody," Shorey said. "Then getting that win (at the Spartan) gave me the confidence to win bigger and better tournaments."
Shorey went on to win the Class A title that season and was third at the New Englands as a junior. He now has 181 career wins.
Shorey, Beaulieu, Cody Craig of Skowhegan and Caleb Austin of Mountain Valley all entered the season with a chance to pass the Maine record of 212 career wins set by Cody Hughes of Marshwood.
Shorey, 17-0 this season and wrestling mostly at 145 pounds, agreed big invitational tournaments are an important part of achieving team and personal goals.
"Tournaments like this really help us as a team to see where other teams are at and what we need to work harder at," Shorey said. "It shows us what we need to do to win that state title as a team and win that state title as an individual." Steve Craig can be reached at 791-6413 or: scraig@pressherald.com Twitter: SteveCCraig

Texto completo:   Several new state laws will go into effect on Jan. 1 including one that tightens the rules for patients and doctors around opioid prescription drugs.
AUGUSTA -- A handful of new state laws will go into effect on New Year's Day, including one that aims to help combat Maine's opioid addiction crisis by limiting dosage amounts of pain-killing opioid prescriptions.
The law could affect as many as 16,000 Mainers, and some state lawmakers already are crafting bills that could roll back the change, which sets the maximum dosage at 100 morphine milligram equivalents per day.
The new law also limits opioid prescriptions for chronic pain to just 30 days, compared with 90 days under current law. In addition, the law limits prescriptions for short-term pain treatment to seven days, down from 10.
The law does provide exceptions to the dosage cap for those suffering from acute pain, such as end-of-life, cancer and after-surgery pain.
Other laws going into effect Sunday include one to allow hard cider made in Maine to become a little harder - going from a maximum 7 percent alcohol by volume to 8.5 percent - and another that requires the state Department of Health and Human Services to increase the reimbursement rates for those who provide home care services to Mainers who receive state-covered health care.
In other changes, high school diplomas awarded by public secondary schools will have to be based on the state's new proficiency-based performance standards, and employers will be allowed a tax credit of up to a $30 per employee when they are enrolled in a group disability income-protection plan.
The Jan. 1 laws are a small fraction of the measures passed by the Legislature. Most new laws become effective 90 days after the Legislature adjourns, typically in June. A few bills with "emergency preambles," which require two-thirds support in the Legislature, become effective almost immediately.
SOME OPIOID USERS SAY LIMITS GO TOO FAR
The law setting new limits on prescription painkillers, agreed to by the Maine Medical Association, which represents most of the state's doctors, is among the most controversial bills passed. At least two lawmakers have said they will try to change those limits after hearing from constituents who said the restrictions will either make them completely disabled or force them to seek opioid pain medicine in the illegal underground market.
Sen. James Dill, D-Old Town, said Wednesday that he was working to draft legislation that could loosen some of the new opioid restrictions or provide an appeal process for patients who require larger doses.
Dill said during his re-election campaign that he visited with dozens of constituents who said the new limits would cause them severe hardships.
"While many of these people are not at a 300 milligram equivalent of morphine amount (the previous limit), the dosage they are at is life-functioning for them," Dill said. "Without that, some of them could not function, for lots of reasons, some of it is because of illness, some of it was due to accidents."
The new law takes too much of a one-size-fits-all approach, Dill said.
"What I am aiming to do is either grandfather these people in" or create an appeals process for them, he said.
Although supporters hope the law will limit the exposure and potential for addiction and abuse of opioids, it is not based in medical science, compassion or fairness, Dill said.
However, Dr. Christopher Pezzullo, Maine's chief health officer, has said the dosage maximum is important because the science does not support such high doses and has shown a connection between higher doses and increased patient overdoses.
The dosage cap of 100 morphine milligram equivalents closely coincides with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on prescribing opioids that were released in March as part of the effort to stem the nation's opioid crisis. There were 286 overdose deaths in Maine through the first nine months of 2016.
Dill planned to meet Wednesday with Sen. Geoffrey Gratwick, D-Bangor. Gratwick, a medical doctor, was among lawmakers who opposed the new limits and also is working on legislation that could modify the law.
STATE PARK PASSES TO COST 50% MORE
Another change coming for Mainers in 2017 is a 50 percent price increase for season passes to the state's park system. Season automobile passes to the state's 64 parks and historical sites will jump from $70 a year to $105 starting Sunday.
John Bott, a spokesman for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, which oversees state parks and forests, said Wednesday that the increase is part of a fee restructuring put in place this year, but its implementation was delayed until 2017. Bott noted that prices for day passes to parks increased in 2016 as well, with Maine residents paying $2 more per visit and nonresidents paying $4 more.
Bott said the state had not increased its admission rates for over 14 years, and in some categories, fees have been stagnant for more than 21 years. "Unlike other states, we haven't had steady incremental increases," he said.
So far, he said, complaints have been minimal because most park visitors seem to understand the need for revenue. Bott said even at the new higher rate, a family of four would break even on an annual park pass after just four visits.
"We thought we would get some pushback," Bott said. "But it really didn't seem to have much of an effect." Scott Thistle can be contacted at 791-6330 or at: sthistle@pressherald.com Twitter: thisdog

Texto completo:   Maine home sales jumped and prices shot up as well in November.
The Maine Real Estate Information System reported that 1,414 homes changed hands last month, an increase of 17.74 percent over the 1,201 homes that sold in November 2015. Prices were up as well, to a statewide median of $191,863, compared to $180,000 in November 2015. That's an increase of 6.59 percent.
Both indicators are in line with regional and national trends, showing strong residential sales closing out 2016. Nationally, existing homes jumped 16.2 percent since last November. The National Association of Realtors also reported a 6.8 percent rise of the national median sales price to $236,500. The Northeast region experienced a 15.7 percent increase in sales while the median price was up 3.3 percent to $263,000.
Brenda Fontaine of Fontaine Family real estate said she senses that a lot of momentum has built up in the Maine housing market that will carry on past the holidays.
"It's been a great year and I think next year will also be a great year," said Fontaine, whose firm has offices in Auburn and Scarborough.
Fontaine said the only thing holding back the market, particularly in the Lewiston-Auburn area, is a lack of inventory. That means there are often multiple offers on houses for sale, which explains the higher prices, she said.
Fontaine said interest rates on mortgages have inched up as the year has gone on, but they are still low by historical standards and that will help fuel the market. She said buyers who can get a state or federally backed housing loan can still find rates below 4 percent, which makes houses affordable to more people.
Next year, Fontaine said, she expects to see more buyers moving up to larger houses. After years of staying in the same house because of the market collapse six or seven years ago, she said, many families may find that prices have recovered enough that it's a good time to sell and step up to a larger house.
The strength of the housing market varied around the state. Three counties - Waldo, Cumberland, and Washington - reported a decline in the number of sales during the September to November quarter, compared to the same three months in 2015. In Waldo, and Cumberland counties, the declines were modest at 0.69 percent and 1.01 percent, respectively, but in Washington County, the decline was sharper, at 8.5 percent. But in raw numbers, rather than percentages, that was a minor reduction, reflecting a decline from 105 homes sold in during the quarter last year compared to 96 sold during the same three months this year.
Aroostook County recorded the sharpest increase in home sales during the quarter, from 123 last year to 175 this year, a rise of 44.28 percent. Oxford and Penobscot counties also reported sharply higher sales during the quarter.
On the price side, the biggest jump in median prices during the quarter was in Knox County, where the median sales price increased from $187,250 to $222,250, an increase of 18.69 percent. Most other counties saw increases of around 7 or 8 percent.
The only decline in median price was in Aroostook County, where the median price during the September-November quarter slipped from $84,000 last year to $83,000 this year.
Sales were especially strong in Massachusetts, according to The Associated Press.
It reported that the Boston-based Warren Group reported that the 5,061 single-family homes sold in the state last month was the highest November sales amount since 1998 and a 26 percent increase over the same month last year.
The Massachusetts Association of Realtors, meanwhile, reported that November recorded the most closed sales for the month on record.
Both organizations also reported an increase in median prices of about 5 to 6 percent -- up to $365,000 according to the Realtors and up to $349,000 according to The Warren Group. The groups use different numbers in their calculations.

Texto completo:   Last year when Skowhegan won the Noble Invitational Wrestling Tournament, edging host Noble, Foxcroft and four-time defending Class A champion Marshwood, it was a harbinger of things to come.
Skowhegan went on to win its first Class A title and Foxcroft won the Class B crown.
"Winning Noble was obviously a big milestone because we had never won that and it showed the kids that the idea of winning a state title was a real possibility," said Brooks Thompson, Skowhegan's co-head coach with Tenney Noyes. "If we could win one of the toughest tournaments in the state, definitely the toughest that we go to, then we could beat the Marshwoods and the Nobles at the state tournament."
The 35th annual Noble Invitational Wrestling Tournament begins Thursday and concludes Friday. Wrestling starts each day at 9:30 a.m. The tournament will be proceed as scheduled regardless of weather conditions. A significant winter storm is predicted to start Thursday evening and stretch into Friday morning. Gardiner and Nokomis are also scheduled to participate.
"If they want to, teams can come down here and spend the night in the gym," Noble coach Kip DeVoll said. "It'll be a lot cheaper than staying in a hotel and it'll be one of those things they'll remember and talk about no matter what they do in the tournament."
The Noble tournament and next weekend's Spartan Invitational in Sanford typically reveal which teams and individuals are in the top echelon in Maine.
"Usually the team that wins (the Noble) tournament wins at states and the highest B team wins at their states. It is a good indicator," DeVoll said.
Up to 32 different schools -- most from Maine and including squads from New Hampshire and Vermont -- are expected to compete at Noble. Skowhegan is back to defend its title, though the host Knights are favored to win. Marshwood is not attending. The Hawks went instead to the 72-team Lowell (Massachusetts) Invitational, which concluded Wednesday.
On Jan. 6-7, the Spartan Invitational will bring top out-of-state programs Timberlane, New Hampshire, and Danbury, Connecticut. The Spartan tournament has fewer teams but plenty of top-end talent. In 2016, just four of the 14 weight classes were won by Maine wrestlers.
The value of the large midseason tournaments is "you're in a bigger pool of talent so some of your better kids are going to get more competitive matches," said Marshwood coach Matt Rix. "And, if they seed it properly even your less talented kids are going to get a win out of it."
The invitational tournaments can also be a place for young wrestlers to make a name for themselves.
That's what Marshwood senior Bradley Beaulieu did at the Noble tournament his freshman year.
He pulled off a last-second takedown to a near-fall to score five points and force overtime against then unbeaten Peter Del Gallo of Gardiner, a reigning New England champion. Del Gallo ended up winning 12-9 in the second overtime but Beaulieu showed the skill and competitiveness that has since led him to three Class A titles, two top-three finishes at the New England Championships and a college scholarship (to Old Dominion).
Noble senior Austin Shorey, Beaulieu, Skowhegan's Cody Craig, and Mountain Valley's Caleb Austin all entered the season with a chance to surpass the all-time Maine record of 212 career wins set by Cody Hughes of Marshwood.

Resumen: The marijuana law, which passed by a margin of about 4,000 votes, allows towns to regulate the number, location and operation of retail marijuana stores, cultivation, manufacturing and testing facilities and social clubs, and also can impose local licensing requirements. In Madison, Town Manager Tim Curtis said Wednesday that after taking input from residents during a Dec. 19 public hearing, selectmen have scheduled a special town meeting for Jan. 9 to vote on imposing a 180-day moratorium on marijuana retail sales and social clubs.

Texto completo:   Unanimous vote doesn't affect medical marijuana or legal possession by individuals
OAKLAND -- Town councilors in Oakland might have become the first in Maine to adopt an ordinance Wednesday night that prohibits the retail sale of marijuana and the establishment of marijuana social clubs.
The 5-0 vote does not prohibit the legal use and the legal cultivation of marijuana as approved by Maine voters in the Nov. 8 marijuana referendum, Oakland Town Manager Gary Bowman said before Wednesday council meeting. Bowman said marijuana social clubs would be much like bars or pubs, where customers can "smoke a joint in an atmosphere with your friends".
That will not be happening in Oakland.
Eric Conrad, at the Maine Municipal Association, said the Oakland vote "is either first or right up there" among the first to ban such establishments outright.
"I can't guarantee that there's not some town somewhere, but I just talked to our head lawyer and she said, and I agree, that there aren't many that are this far along in a prohibition yet," Conrad said. "As far as we're concerned, if they're not the first, they're one of the very first."
One resident Wednesday night said she is a medical marijuana caregiver and objects to the permanency of such a ban and the word "prohibition" itself.
"I have a big problem with the word 'prohibition,'" Andrea Thomas told council members. "We're not all just stupid stoners. There's a lot of people in this community who need this."
Council Chairman Michael Perkins said the board simply was "erring on the side of caution" for the community and the children of Oakland until the state figures out how to regulate the law. He said the town can revisit the question of a total ban if residents petition to do so.
Thomas countered, saying there are bars and liquor stores in Oakland that no one seems to mind. She said alcohol consumption is far worse than marijuana use.
Councilor Don Borman pointed out that Oakland was once a "dry town" banning sales of hard liquor, but that was reversed when residents petitioned the town to lift the ban. Councilman Dana Wrigley added that the ban also is being fair to retailers who want to invest money in a business that might never open.
The marijuana law, which passed by a margin of about 4,000 votes, allows towns to regulate the number, location and operation of retail marijuana stores, cultivation, manufacturing and testing facilities and social clubs, and also can impose local licensing requirements. They also can become dry towns by implementing an outright ban on all marijuana business, which is what Oakland did Wednesday night.
Private marijuana possession and growing will still be allowed even in towns that ban retail businesses. The ordinance does not affect medical marijuana or personal use of recreational marijuana.
The council voted 5-0 earlier this month to approve the first reading of the ordinance that would prohibit recreational marijuana establishments from starting up in Oakland.
Oakland councilors took the route of becoming a "dry town" rather than implementing a moratorium and local restrictions. Bowman told councilors last month that because the town's comprehensive plan isn't updated and the town doesn't have zoning, it can't enforce a moratorium.
Oakland residents voted 1,914-1,620 on the November ballot against Question 1, the referendum on whether to legalize the recreational sale, possession and use of marijuana.
Skowhegan selectmen in November decided to pursue becoming a dry town after residents voted 2,152-1,897 against Question 1. The Planning Board will develop an ordinance to ban marijuana businesses in Skowhegan. That is expected to be voted on by residents at the annual Town Meeting in June.
If Skowhegan residents decide not to become a dry town, officials will ask them to implement a moratorium to allow town officials time to figure out how to handle marijuana businesses. Skowhegan has a local controlled-substance facility ordinance in place regulating methadone clinics and medical marijuana dispensaries, but town officials said it is unclear if the town can use the same ordinance to regulate recreational marijuana businesses.
In Madison, Town Manager Tim Curtis said Wednesday that after taking input from residents during a Dec. 19 public hearing, selectmen have scheduled a special town meeting for Jan. 9 to vote on imposing a 180-day moratorium on marijuana retail sales and social clubs.
Curtis said that will give town officials six months to look into any changes or new ordinance language about marijuana retail stores, and any changes would be voted on at Town Meeting in June. It would allow local officials time to consider what approach to take in regulating that type of business, Curtis said.
Marijuana is still illegal under federal law and is legal for medical use under state law. With the passage of Question 1 on Nov. 8, adults 21 and older are allowed to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana, grow their own plants and buy marijuana from licensed retail stores. The initiative also allows marijuana social clubs and imposes a 10 percent sales tax on marijuana. Marijuana use will be prohibited in public, with violations punishable by a $100 fine.

Texto completo:   When Annie Cilley went to check on her longtime friend and distant relative Veronica Pendleton one day back in October 2013, she already knew there was a problem.
Cilley had read a story in the Bangor Daily News about a local lawyer being investigated for using his power of attorney status to bilk two elderly women out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"I knew without a doubt she was one of them," Cilley said of her friend.
Pendleton, who was 86 at the time and has since died, had been living at Harbor Hill, a Belfast nursing facility, for about three years after taking a fall at home. True to her independent spirit and somewhat prickly personality, she had not warmed to Cilley's outreach, much less asked for any kind of support.
All that was about to change.
"'I'm in an awful mess,' she told me," Cilley said. "She said, 'Can you help me?'"
The mess Pendleton was in was legal and financial, and it was serious. Her lawyer -- William Dawson of Belfast -- to whom she had assigned power of attorney over her personal and financial affairs, had just been removed from that role by the Waldo County Probate Court. There were allegations that, in addition to paying her bills and looking after her home, he had been writing suspiciously large checks to himself out of her bank account on a regular basis.
Dawson also had power of attorney for another woman, Doris Schmidt, also now deceased, who lived in the same facility as Pendleton. He had been helping himself to her money as well. In March 2016, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison for stealing a total of nearly $500,000 from the two women, both of whom reportedly suffered from dementia and had no close family members.
It was a bank worker who noticed the suspicious activity in the two women's accounts and notified officials at the Maine Department of Health and Human Services.
"Nobody would ever have known if it hadn't been for the bank teller," said Jaye Martin, executive director of Maine Legal Services for the Elderly. LSE is an Augusta-based nonprofit organization that provides free legal services and consultations to low-income Mainers 60 and older.
The incidence of elder financial abuse, by trusted friends and family members as well as by unscrupulous legal professionals like William Dawson, is on the rise in Maine and across the country, Martin said, as the baby boom generation ages and becomes more vulnerable to exploitation.
"Every year, more people age into senior status, so the pool of potential victims grows," she said.
Hard data is difficult to come by, but experts say the sluggish consumer economy and related social factors such as unemployment, substance abuse, gambling addiction and debt increase the temptation to take advantage of another person's money and other assets, as Martin reported in recent testimony before the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging.
Financial abuse of seniors takes many forms. Their bank accounts can be drained, credit cards maxed out, jewelry and other valuables sold, home ownership and occupancy imperiled. Dependent seniors may be essentially isolated in their own homes, the homes of a family member or a nursing facility to force them to hand over their assets or prevent them from seeking help.
Asking for help is often hard, Martin said. Seniors may be unaware of the exploitation, embarrassed to have been the victim of a con job or reluctant to blow the whistle on a trusted family member. And even when abuse is reported, the money is often long gone and cannot be recovered, as was true in Pendleton's case.
"We all want to think this will never happen to us," Martin said, but studies show one out of every 10 seniors will fall victim to financial abuse. And it's not just the physically frail, the emotionally vulnerable or the cognitively impaired who are affected; seniors who are fully functional and financially astute can be targeted as well, often by younger family members.
"It's so horrific, who wants to think their kids are going to do this to them?" Martin asked.
In her Nov. 30 presentation to the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, which is chaired by Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Martin reported that her agency has assisted 260 victims of financial abuse and exploitation over the past 12 months, a 24 percent increase over the previous year.
That increase is in part due to the aging of Maine's population, she told the committee, but is also driven by a multipronged public awareness campaign here funded through a 3-year grant from the John T. Gorman Foundation, which has a special focus on the needs of elderly Mainers.
That campaign has included training front-line bank staff to recognize and report suspicious activity in seniors' accounts, in keeping with the Senior Safe program, a partnership between Maine financial institutions, the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation and the office of Aging and Disability Resources within DHHS.
LSE has also produced a series of short public service videos for television aimed at raising awareness among vulnerable seniors and their families.
The organization has also developed a comprehensive Elder Rights Handbook that includes detailed information on preventing, recognizing and reporting different forms of elder abuse, including financial exploitation. The handbook is available online or in print.
Collins' committee conducts hearings on issues related to aging in the United States. The Nov. 30 hearing, " Trust Betrayed: Financial Abuse of Older Americans by Guardians and Others in Power," can be watched online. Guardians are typically court-appointed to look after the finances and other interests of incapacitated individuals, including seniors with dementia.
In a statement this week, Collins said the prevalence of elder financial abuse by family members, court-appointed guardians and others with power of attorney is not easy to quantify or address. But she said, "Seniors in need of assistance to manage their financial affairs should not have their trust betrayed, leaving them destitute in some cases. Guardians should be protecting vulnerable seniors, not stealing from them."
Solutions should include more consistent oversight of bank transactions, Collins said, perhaps utilizing advanced technology that automatically flags unusual activity. In addition, she said, individuals with power of attorney must understand their duty is to serve the best interest of the senior.
"The funds that a guardian oversees still belong to the senior and must be managed on his or her behalf," Collins said. "We should insist on transparency over how guardians manage resources under their care, through clear and regular accounting."
A task force created in 2014 by Maine Attorney General Janet Mills conducted a yearlong study to evaluate the prosecution of elder financial abuse and the response of the state's criminal justice community. In its report issued in March 2015, the task force found a number of systemic deficiencies, including a perception that senior financial abuse is a family issue as opposed to a criminal matter, a lack of training in handling financial crimes against the elderly, a backlog of cases languishing in the courts system and other inadequacies.
The group's recommendations included establishing a multi-agency "financial abuse specialist team" to more efficiently investigate and prosecute reported cases of senior financial abuse and exploitation, prioritizing cases in the courts so restitution and resolution can be reached before aging victims die, changing criminal sentencing guidelines to take into account a victim's age and more. Most of the report's recommendations have been implemented, Mills said, with the exception of adding staff to her office dedicated to the issue of senior financial abuse, due to lack of funding.
Also key to decreasing rates of financial abuse against seniors, MIlls said, is providing more training and court oversight for any individual who is named power of attorney or has other access to a senior's money, home and other assets.
"Power of attorney is not a license to steal," Mills said, and seniors and their families need to know that a legal power of attorney can and should be revoked if abuse is known or even suspected -- as it was in the case of William Dawson and Veronica Pendleton.
Annie Cilley, who is now 78, stepped in to help her friend when Dawson's criminal activity was discovered. After a lengthy legal process, she was named conservator of Victoria Pendleton's affairs, which allowed her to settle unpaid bills and make needed repairs to the older woman's house in Belfast.
In January 2014, Pendleton moved back home with 24-hour nursing care. She died there three months later.
It troubles her, Cilley said, that her headstrong friend spent the last years of her life essentially imprisoned in the nursing facility and without access to her own finances. She missed living in her own home, managing her own affairs and watching the birds and squirrels in her yard.
"Dawson kept her locked up in that place for four years while he took her money," she said. "She had enough money to live at home instead, with a live-in nurse full-time and the life she wanted to live."
Dawson's sentence included an order that he repay Pendleton's estate $385,000, and $98,000 to Doris Schmidt's. But since he filed for personal bankruptcy just prior to sentencing, it is unclear how he will comply. Dawson has been disbarred from practicing in Maine.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Hullabaloo about whether any of Maine's four Electoral College electors would defy the will of Election Day voters fizzled Monday afternoon at the State House when three electors voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton and one for President-elect Donald Trump.
In the weeks since Trump's Election Day surprise victory, rumors swirled that some Republican electors would vote against the New York billionaire. In Maine, the focus shifted Monday morning to Democrats after elector David Bright announced he would cast his ballot for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who beat Clinton in the state's Democratic caucuses in March.
During Maine's Electoral College voting Monday afternoon at the State House, Bright cast a secret-ballot vote for Sanders but was ruled out of order by Maine Electoral College President Betty Johnson. When the ballots were recast, the tally was three for Clinton and one for Trump.
That tally reflected Clinton's statewide win, which was worth two votes, and her victory in the 1st Congressional District, which earned her a third. Because Trump received more votes in the 2nd District, he earned a single Electoral College vote
This year marked the first time since 1828 that Maine has split its Electoral College votes. It is one of two states -- Nebraska being the other -- that does not use a winner-take-all format to allocate electoral votes.
Bright's first vote ended up being merely symbolic.
"I cast my first Electoral College vote for Bernie Sanders today to let those new voters who were inspired by him know that some of us did hear them, did listen to them and understand their disappointment," said Bright. "I want them to know that not only can they come back to the process, but that they will be welcomed back; that there is room in the Democratic Party for their values."
There is no provision in federal law or the U.S. Constitution that requires electors to vote in accordance with their state's popular vote totals, but Maine has a state law that addresses the matter. Maine law states "the presidential electors at large shall cast their ballots for the presidential and vice presidential candidates who received the largest number of votes."
Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett said he respected Bright's decision to try to cast his ballot for Sanders.
"Presidential electors play an important role in our democracy and are enabled by our constitution to make an independent judgement," said Bartlett in a written statement to the Bangor Daily News.
But Democratic Senate Minority Leader Troy Jackson of Allagash, who was Sanders' political director in Maine, said he did not support Bright's decision..
"The reality is that Hillary was our nominee," said Jackson. "I believe in theory with what [Bright] is doing but I personally wouldn't do that."
Richard Bennett, chairman of the Maine Republican Party, cast Maine's lone electoral vote for Trump. He said Mainers and citizen across the nation are "filled with hope and optimism" of being freed from taxes, over-regulation, debt and global threats. Bennett had harsh words regarding Democratic President Barack Obama.
"Our nation, our interests and our future children's prosperity have not been well cared for," said Bennett.
As the proceeding unfolded somberly inside the State House, a rather large contingent of protesters and counter-protesters made noise outside. While an anti-Trump group gathered about an hour before the ceremony, supporters of the president-elect gathered at nearby GOP headquarters and symbolically marched to the State House with Bennett.
Jon McKibben of Caribou was one of the pro-Trump demonstrators.
"We're here to ensure the integrity of the Electoral College," said McKibben, a Trump supporter. "The last six or eight weeks have just been a wild ride that I think everyone wants out of at this point. I think it's going to get worse before it gets better and I'm here to show solidarity."
On the other side of the protest was Debby Smith of Belfast. She said she had no hope that the Electoral College would deny Trump the presidency.
"It could be a lost cause but I feel like I need to do what I can to be present and to have the world know that we're watching and we care," she said.
Peter Conant of Appleton said Trump isn't qualified for the presidency.
"He treats the whole thing like a game or a circus," said Conant.
Trump will be sworn in as the 45th U.S. president on Jan. 20.

Resumen: The act will require a comprehensive examination of how to strengthen American security at the northern border, focusing on such issues as recruiting and retaining border security officials, including at more remote areas; determining tools border security officials need to effectively combat drug and human trafficking; identifying technology that could expand the reach of border agents; and finding vulnerabilities in cooperation between state, county, local, tribal, and Canadian law enforcement.

Texto completo:   WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced Dec. 15 that the president has signed the Northern Border Security Review Act, a bipartisan bill to assess and strengthen American security at the northern border, into law.
Both senators are cosponsors of the legislation, which aims to make sure that Maine communities remain strong and safe.
"It's absolutely critical that we have a secure northern border, and the comprehensive review triggered by this bill is a valuable step forward in assessing and strengthening those efforts on the ground," said Collins and King in a joint statement.
"We're glad that the president has signed the Northern Border Security Review Act into law, and will continue to work with Maine law enforcement, federal partners, and other border community members with the shared goal of keeping Maine safe and secure."
Now law, the Northern Border Security Review Act requires the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to evaluate security threats at the border -- the longest common land border in the world -- through a comprehensive examination of current resources and personnel levels. The assessments called for in the bill will help tackle the coordination challenges that federal border security officials and local law enforcement face, and address how to recruit and retain a strong border security workforce.
The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved the bill late last month, just weeks after it unanimously passed in the U.S. Senate. After the bill passed the Senate, Senators Collins and King received a classified briefing by high-ranking officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on threat reporting, smuggling and trafficking trends, border security technology requirements and staffing in remote locations.
At 5,500 miles long, including 1,500 miles between Alaska and Canada, the northern border has more than 120 border crossings, many of which are small and in rural areas. Approximately 300,000 people and $910 million in trade cross the border every day.
The act will require a comprehensive examination of how to strengthen American security at the northern border, focusing on such issues as recruiting and retaining border security officials, including at more remote areas; determining tools border security officials need to effectively combat drug and human trafficking; identifying technology that could expand the reach of border agents; and finding vulnerabilities in cooperation between state, county, local, tribal, and Canadian law enforcement.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- President Barack Obama shortened the prison sentences for 153 convicts, mainly low-level drug offenders, and pardoned 78 others -- including two men from Maine, the White House said on Monday.
The Mainers who were granted pardons were Robert Spencer Baines of South Thomaston and Francis Joseph O'Hara Sr. of Camden.
Baines was sentenced in July 1986 to six years in prison for conspiracy to possess and possession with intent to distribute more than 1,000 pounds of marijuana, according to the White House.
O'Hara received a six-month sentence in September 1991 for conspiracy to restrain, suppress and eliminate competition by rigging bids, and conspiracy with others to knowingly and willfully make and use false documents containing false statements in matters within the jurisdiction of the Defense Personnel Support Command.
In addition to his prison term, O'Hara was ordered to undergo
two years of supervised release and pay a $200,000 fine and $950,000 in restitution.
In the years leading up to his conviction, O'Hara was working for National Sea Products, a fishing company founded by his father in 1940.
O'Hara was the subject of an Aug. 26, 1988, Bangor Daily News article about the end of Rockland's groundfish industry in the wake of a 1984 World Court decision that set the ocean boundary for fishing at a point halfway between U.S. and Canadian territory, ignoring traditional fishing grounds and deep-water areas.
As a result of that decision, fishing grounds off Grand Manan and the Southwest Bank traditionally fished by Mainers become off limits. Maine fishing companies were left with Cashes Ledge, which at the time already was overfished.
In the article, O'Hara said that business became so bad that he and several other East Coast fishing companies were convicted of a $75 million scheme to fix prices on Department of Defense contracts for fish.
During his tenure, Obama has commuted the sentences of 1,176 federal prisoners, the White House said, as part of a push to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.
Monday's commutations and pardons were the most acts of clemency in a single day by any U.S. president, the White House reported.
In 2014, Obama announced he would use his clemency powers to reduce sentences he saw as overly harsh. That came after criminal justice bills aimed at non-violent drug offenders stalled in Congress.
In addition to commuting sentences, Obama has pardoned 148 people in total.
White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said they were people who led "productive and law-abiding" lives and contributed to their communities after being convicted.
Eggleston said in a blog post released by the White House that he expected Obama would issue more commutations and pardons before leaving office in January, but he said only Congress could make broader changes to the criminal justice system.

Texto completo:   CUSHING, Maine -- In a rare move, federal prosecutors have charged a local lobsterman in connection with the deaths of two sternmen who died when his boat sank off Matinicus two years ago.
Christopher Hutchinson, 28, is accused of having been under the influence of drugs when the incident occurred on Nov. 1, 2014, according to federal court documents.
He was arrested Monday and charged by indictment with two counts of seaman's manslaughter, the U.S. Attorney's office indicated Monday in a prepared statement. Tom Hammond, 27, of Rockland and 15-year-old Tyler Sawyer, who lived in St. George and Waldoboro, drowned when Hutchinson's lobster boat No Limits capsized in heavy seas as the boat was headed back to shore.
The U.S. Coast Guard investigated the case.
It was not clear Monday when the last time anyone was charged in Maine in connection with the death of someone at sea. A fatal collision in 2010 between two lobster boats off Winter Harbor resulted in a recommendation from the Coast Guard that one of the captains be criminally charged, but federal prosecutors declined to do so.
According to Hutchinson's indictment, on the night before he and his crew went out fishing, he is alleged to have bought oxycodone without a prescription, smoked marijuana and drank alcohol. At around 9 p.m. the following day, after the Coast Guard rescued Hutchinson from a life raft, police drew a blood sample from him. Tests revealed the sample contained 8.7 nanograms of oxycodone per milliliter and 6.2 nanograms per milliliter of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, prosecutors wrote in the document.
"The indictment alleges that [Hutchinson's] negligent and unsafe operation of the boat in forecasted dangerous weather and sea conditions and after using controlled substances and alcohol caused the loss of life," federal officials wrote in the statement.
The indictment also indicates that warnings about dangerous marine weather were being broadcast by radio prior to the vessel's departure from Tenants Harbor early on the morning of Nov. 1, 2014. Later that morning, around the time the boat flipped, weather sensor buoys in the area indicated winds were gusting to more than 46 mph and waves reached heights of more than 14 feet, federal officials noted.
Last year, the families of Hammond and Sawyer reached a civil settlement for more than $300,000 with Hutchinson and the vessel's insurer. A judge later awarded $170,500 to Hammond's family, which includes a young son, and $139,500 to Sawyer's family.
Days after the boat capsized, Hutchinson told the Bangor Daily News the incident happened when they were done hauling traps for the day and were headed back to Tenants Harbor. The weather worsened, he said, and large waves swamped the vessel, causing it to flip over.
Hutchinson said he swam out of the wheelhouse to the surface and climbed on top of the overturned hull, where he clung to the keel and the bronze pipes of the keel cooler.
"I kept screaming for Tom and Tyler, but I didn't hear or see them again," Hutchinson said.
More than two hours later, the boat's life raft popped to the surface and its emergency position indicating radio beacon, or EPIRB, was activated. Hutchinson swam to the raft and fired off a flare before being rescued by the Coast Guard approximately five hours after the boat capsized.
Hammond's and Sawyer's bodies never were recovered. Both were declared presumed dead by the Coast Guard later that month.
Hutchinson was scheduled to make his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Portland on Monday. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- The City Council voted unanimously Monday to create an office designed to help immigrants and disadvantaged Mainers find work in the state's economic hub.
Councilors voted to establish the Office of Economic Opportunity in their final scheduled meeting of the year, after months of deliberation and meetings with the city's various immigrant communities. The new bureau aims to help new Mainers and those who may face discrimination in the labor market find work and job training, but those goals still depend on the city finding more than $165,000 in grant funding.
The council named creating the office as one of its top priorities for 2016, following a BDN report that highlighted immigration as a potential solution to Maine's looming labor crisis and showed how other American cities have spurred economic growth by connecting immigrants with jobs. The new office is the first of its kind in Maine, according to Councilor David Brenerman, who led the committee that developed it.
"This will do more for the city than, perhaps, anything we have done in my first year," Mayor Ethan Strimling said, thanking Brenerman.
The office was designed to help new Mainers enroll in and coordinate education and training programs, such as those offered by groups like Catholic Charities and Portland Adult Education. The office will connect immigrants and underserved populations with opportunities but is not meant to be a service provider itself, Brenerman said.
The creation of the office was welcomed by several new Mainers who spoke at the council meeting.
"It is really helpful to see that the city is coming together to acknowledge the work of the immigrants and actually empower the immigrants to work together to advance the work of the state [of Maine]," Claude Rwaganje, executive director of Portland immigrant aid group Community Financial Literacy, said.
The office will have a staff of three, with a director, answerable to the city manager, and two program managers focused on immigrant integration, inclusion and equity.
Including salaries, the office will have a startup budget of nearly $260,000, but the city has allocated funds for less than half that amount. More than $165,000 of the new office's budget is meant to come from grants, according to the memorandum sent to the full council by the Economic Development Committee. No grants have yet been obtained for this purpose.
The salaries of both program managers are meant to come from grant funding, an approach that has bedeviled Portland before.
The city this summer shuttered its Office of Refugee Services after failing to win renewal of federal grants that funded the program.
"Even if we couldn't find all the grant funding we want to, this is a program [budget] that the city could step into if necessary," said Justin Costa, who sat on the Economic Development Committee as it developed the new office.
Brenerman said specific grants have not been lined up to fund the office, but the city councilors emphasized the importance of easing immigrants' entry into Portland's workforce. Indeed, the vitality of the metro area that accounts for more than half of Maine's economy increasingly relies on it.
As the state grays, Mainers are leaving the workforce faster than new workers enter. In Portland, where about 15 percent of residents were born outside the United States, the population would have shrunk if not for immigration in recent years, according to a recent study.
"The entire United States is not making enough babies and immigrants really need to be part of the solution if we are to remain globally competitive," immigration lawyer Beth Stickney told City Council.

Interim UMaine baseball coach to stress discipline, aggressiveness

Texto completo:   Nick Derba came to the University of Maine in 2013 to start his career as a baseball coach.
He had recently hung up his catcher's gear after a six-year career in the St. Louis Cardinals system that included 61 games at the Class AAA level.
Never could the native of Queens, New York, have imagined that only three years later he would be a Division I head coach.
The 31-year-old Derba on Saturday was announced as the Black Bears' interim head coach after 11-year coach Steve Trimper accepted the head coaching position at Stetson University in Deland, Florida.
"I wasn't expecting it to happen here at Maine and I wasn't expecting it to happen as soon as it has," said Derba, who also played under Trimper at Manhattan College before being selected in the 30th round of the 2007 major league draft.
"I'm very happy the opportunity has occurred at a place like Maine and with the guys that we have. I don't know if I could have asked for a much better situation," Derba said.
Derba already was a key member of the staff and spent the last 17 months as UMaine's associate head coach. His new appointment coincides with the semester break, which will give him a few weeks to begin putting his own stamp on the program.
The Black Bears begin full-team workouts on Jan. 22, 2017, in anticipation of their Feb. 17 season opener at Winthrop University in South Carolina.
"I guess the thoughts are, business as usual. I don't know if the transition's going to be too crazy," said Derba, pointing to the support of a capable staff.
His assistants include Conor Burke, former UMaine standout Scott Heath of Westbrook and volunteer assistant Taylor Lewis, a former Black Bears star who is completing his degree work at UMaine. Derba hopes Heath will be promoted from volunteer status.
Derba will continue to work with the hitters but will spend more time with the pitchers. Burke will coach hitting, Heath will work with the pitchers and Lewis will concentrate on outfield play and baserunning.
"These guys know the system. I feel like we have a very professional staff," Derba said.
He said he already has reached out to all current players, National Letter of Intent signees and verbal commits by phone to touch base and allay any fears they may have had.
"I know that the team is very excited and having that support from the players is huge," Derba said.
Derba said it is hard quantify how his approach might differ from that of Trimper, whose teams compiled only a 68-92 record over the last three seasons.
"My biggest thing is that we're a very disciplined team that is extremely aggressive" and not afraid to make mistakes, Derba said.
He is looking forward to the challenge of being in charge and isn't concerned about having the interim tag attached to his job title.
"If we do our job, do it right and Karlton likes it, we'll be back here [next year]," Derba said, referring to UMaine athletics director Karlton Creech.
He believes his time spent in the minor leagues helped him develop baseball knowledge and put him in situations where he faced frequent challenges and criticism.
"I was lucky enough to learn from what I think is the best organization in baseball and learning the Cardinal way is something that I hope we can instill here and kind of intertwine with the Black Bear way," Derba said.
"Besides the X's and O's, it's learning to go about your business day in and day out and really take pride in what you're learning."
This season's UMaine baseball team has already shown Derba that it has the proper mix of work ethic and positive attitude.
He pointed out that UMaine has several players on the roster.
"There's a special group here," Derba said. "They've really taken to the culture of the program and they are really prideful that they play for the University of Maine."

Maine electoral vote had surprises. They had little to do with Trump.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- As goes Maine, so went no other state.
On Monday, 538 electors gathered in state capitals and District of Columbia to cast ballots in the Electoral College, the official selection of the next President and vice president of the United States. But no locale had the historical significance of Maine, which had two surprise twists during what is typically a pompless and understated hour-long ceremony in the State House.
This Electoral College marked the first time that Maine's four electors have divided since the state started in 1972 to allocate one electoral vote for each of its two congressional districts, plus another two votes for the statewide winner (Nebraska is currently the only other state to pick its electors statewide and by congressional district).
The day would also mark the first time Maine has awarded an Electoral College vote to a Republican since 1988. On Nov. 8, the state's Second District voted for Donald Trump.
As the ceremony began at the State House, the electors sat next to each other in the front row of the chamber. But one was missing: Sam Shapiro, 89, couldn't make it back from Florida in time to cast his ballot. He was replaced by Betty Johnson, 77, of Lincolnville, to serve as a delegate for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
But the buzz of the day centered not on Shapiro's replacement or even the sole Republican elector -- who delivered Trump his lone Electoral College vote in New England. Earlier in the day, Democrat David Bright announced on Facebook that he planned to vote for US Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton's primary foe, instead of her.
Bright, a 68-year-old Sanders supporter who co-owns BrightBerry Farm in Dixmont, Maine, did just that on the first ballot. But Johnson ruled it out of order since, under state rules, electors can only choose candidates on the ballot.
The room gasped, and Bright appeared stunned -- but he later told reporters that the showdown was worked out in advance.
Maine is one of 30 states that binds electors to the will of the state's voters. What's more, Bright would likely be impeached -- perhaps even arrested and charged for a misdemeanor -- if he kept writing Sanders on his ballot.
When electors were given a second ballot, Bright wrote in Clinton, giving her the 3-1 win in the state. (Hours later, Donald Trump won the Electoral College by acquiring the necessary 270 votes nationwide to secure the presidency. )
But for Bright, it wasn't about Clinton, he said, but rather about inspiring the youth who helped Sanders easily defeat Clinton in the Democratic caucuses in the state.
"I wanted to say that I hear you, and I want you to stay engaged," Bright said.
Before the Electoral College officially took place, about 100 GOP activists gathered outside of the state Republican headquarters in frigid temperatures. They munched on doughnuts and drank coffee before forming human shields around the lone Republican elector, Richard Bennett, as he marched through a gauntlet of protesters on the way to cast his ballot.
Republicans carried signs that read "Making America Great Again"and "CNN is State News," as they mingled and chanted. Protestors held signs that read "Get Your Orange Hands Off Me" and "Making Russia Great Again."
"I thought, you know, it is a quiet thing, you go to state House, they vote and nobody pays any attention," said Bennett about being a delegate. "I went once or twice (to other Electoral Colleges) and the chamber was empty, nobody was there, just political wonks. But now it is suddenly a big deal."
As the nearly 1,000 people stood in long winding line to get out of the cold and in through metal detectors, the crowd broke out into song -- "God Bless America."

Donald Trump Wins Enough Electoral Votes to Become President; Electoral vote proceeds with no sign of major defections

Texto completo:   WASHINGTON--Members of the Electoral College meeting in state capitals across the country on Monday confirmed President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 election, ending a last-ditch campaign to deny him the presidency.
Mr. Trump amassed at least 270 electoral votes on Monday afternoon--enough to officially become the president-elect over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, according to a tally of votes by the Associated Press.
A vote of Texas' 38 electors on Monday at the state capitol building in Austin put Mr. Trump over the top, assuring his victory.
Typically just a formality, this year's Electoral College vote attracted an outsize amount of attention after a group of mostly Democratic electors made a late push to block Mr. Trump's path to the White House. They argued the Electoral College had a constitutional duty to act independently of the will of the voters in extraordinary circumstances. Protesters gathered in several state capitols across the country to encourage electors to reject Mr. Trump.
Members of the Electoral College reported being deluged with correspondence in the run-up to the vote from people urging them to reconsider their vote for Mr. Trump and citing such reasons as Mrs. Clinton's popular vote win and alleged interference from Russia in the election results.
Mrs. Clinton's popular vote surpassed Mr. Trump's by more than 2.5 million. Mr. Trump won a majority of the popular vote in enough states to accumulate 306 electoral votes to Hillary Clinton's 232.
Four Democratic electors in Washington state broke ranks--with three casting ballots for former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and one for Native American activist Faith Spotted Eagle. In the vice presidential vote, the Washington vote was even more unusual, with electors casting votes for a trio of female U.S. senators: Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Susan Collins of Maine. Another elector cast a ballot for Winona LaDuke, an environmental activist.
Several other attempts by electors to cast ballots failed. The Associated Press reported that attempts by Democratic electors in Colorado and Maine to vote for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders failed. In Maine, the elector was ordered to vote again, while in Colorado an elector was replaced.
Defections are possible in the coming hours as more electors vote, but there appeared to be little appetite among members of the Electoral College to overturn the will of the voters in their states despite pressure from activists opposed to Mr. Trump.
One group of Democratic electors calling themselves the Hamilton Electors--after President Alexander Hamilton, who helped design an independent Electoral College--mounted a campaign to try to rally around another Republican to make it impossible for any candidate to get the required 270 votes.
The Electoral College, now comprised of 538 members representing 50 states and the District of Columbia, was originally designed to act as an independent body. Some states require their electors to vote the same way as the voters in each state, but those laws have never been tested. Each state is allocated the same number of electors as their U.S. representatives and senators combined, with Washington, D.C., getting three thanks to a 1961 amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
There have occasionally been "faithless" electors who ignore the will of the voters in their states, but they've never swung the outcome of an election.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on the Electoral College meeting Monday to formally elect Donald Trump the nation's 45th president (all times EST):
3:01 p.m.
Electors in Wyoming and one in Maine have pushed Republican Donald Trump closer to formally winning the presidency.
The votes bring Trump's total to 219 electors. Oregon, New Mexico and Colorado -- plus three in Maine -- bring Democrat Hillary Clinton's total to 120.
Two hundred-seventy votes are required to win the White House. Trump is expected to reach that threshold.
2:48 p.m.
A Texas elections official says as many as four of the state's presidential electors may be replaced before Republicans begin casting ballots in the Electoral College, though Donald Trump isn't expected to lose any of those votes.
Texas Secretary of State spokeswoman Alicia Pierce says up to three electors may be disqualified for having jobs with the federal government. Another elector previously resigned after expressing concern about Trump's presidential qualifications.
Because Republicans will pick the replacements, Trump isn't expected to lose those electors.
Texas has 38 presidential electors.
2:30 p.m.
Electors in Michigan and Florida have cast their combined 45 votes for Donald Trump, making his his Electoral College total jump closer to the amount required to formally win the presidency.
The states, with 16 and 19 votes respectively, bring Trump's total to 215 electors. Two hundred-seventy votes are required to win the White House.
Democrat Hillary Clinton has 96 votes. She won the national popular vote, and protests continued around the country in state capitols where electors were meeting Monday.
But Trump remains poised to win 306 of the 538 electoral votes under the state-by-state distribution of electors used to choose presidents since 1789.
2:14 p.m.
North Dakota, South Dakota and Utah have pushed Republican Donald Trump closer to the 270 votes required to win the presidency.
The states' electors gave Trump 166 electoral votes to Democrat Hillary Clinton's 96 as protests simmered around the country.

2:02 p.m.
A second elector -- this one in Minnesota -- has refused to cast a vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton in Monday's Electoral College tally.
It wasn't immediately clear why Muhammad Abdurrahman didn't vote for Clinton, but he was a delegate for Bernie Sanders at the Democratic National Convention.
The electors are pledged to cast Minnesota's 10 electoral votes for Clinton since she won the state.
Abdurrahman was immediately replaced by an alternate who later voted for Clinton.
Earlier in the day, a so-called "faithless elector" in Maine cast his vote for Sanders, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Clinton. David Bright said on his Facebook page that he cast his vote for Sanders because voting for Clinton would not have helped her win.
1:44 p.m.
The latest votes give 10 electors each to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Monday's Electoral College vote for president. Trump remains far ahead in the formal vote and is expected to win the 270 votes required to win the White House.
Wisconsin's 10 electors have chosen statewide winner Trump, bringing his total to 144 electoral votes. Maryland's 10 electors have chosen Clinton, bringing her total to 59.
The former secretary of state won the national popular vote in the Nov. 8 election. Protesters rallied at state capitols around the country to persuade electors to choose someone other than Trump in the Electoral College vote on Monday.
Trump is poised to win 306 of the 538 electoral votes under the state-by-state distribution of electors used to choose presidents since 1789.
1:10 p.m.
Electors from Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio and Louisiana have given Republican Donald Trump 134 of the 270 electoral votes required to formally win the presidency.
The new total includes 20 votes from Pennsylvania, 18 from Ohio, 15 from North Carolina and eight from Louisiana.
Democrat Hillary Clinton has 43 electoral votes, including 29 from her home state of New York.
She won the national popular vote in the Nov. 8 election, and protesters rallied at state capitols around the country against Trump's expected victory in the Electoral College Monday.
Trump is poised to win 306 of the 538 electoral votes under the state-by-state distribution of electors used to choose presidents since 1789. That's far more than the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency.
12:45 p.m.
Donald Trump has won 68 electoral votes in Monday's tally of the Electoral College.
The new total includes all 16 presidential electors in Georgia and eight in Kentucky, as well as electors in South Carolina, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas.
Hillary Clinton has 10 electoral votes and as well as the Nov. 8 popular vote. Protesters rallied at state capitols around the country against Trump's expected victory in the Electoral College Monday.
Trump is poised to win 306 of the 538 electoral votes under the state-by-state distribution of electors used to choose presidents since 1789. That's far more than the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency.
11:59 a.m.
Democrat Hillary Clinton has won Delaware's three electoral votes -- giving her a total of 10 -- but she's still far behind Republican Donald Trump's total of 44 in Monday's formal tally.
Clinton won Delaware in the Nov. 8 presidential election as well as the national popular vote. Protesters rallied at state capitols around the country against Trump's expected victory in the Electoral College Monday.
Trump is poised to win 306 of the 538 electoral votes under the state-by-state distribution of electors used to choose presidents since 1789. That's far more than the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency.
11:36 a.m.
With a win in South Carolina, Donald Trump now has won 44 electoral votes of the 270 he needs to formally win the presidency.
Democrat Hillary Clinton has won Vermont's three electoral votes.
Trump on Monday also has won votes in Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia.
Clinton won the popular vote in the Nov. 8 election. But Trump is poised to win 306 of the 538 electoral votes under the state-by-state distribution of electors used to choose presidents since 1789.
11:31 p.m.
One faithless elector has cast a vote in Maine -- for Sen. Bernie Sanders.
David Bright said on his Facebook page that he cast his vote for Sanders, instead of Hillary Clinton because his vote would not have helped her win.
"I cast my Electoral College vote for Bernie Sanders today to let those new voters who were inspired by him know that some of us did hear them, did listen to them, do respect them and understand their disappointment," he wrote.
Clinton won the popular vote in the Nov. 8 election. But Trump is poised to win 306 of the 538 electoral votes under the state-by-state distribution of electors used to choose presidents since 1789.

10:29 a.m.
Tennessee's 11 presidential electors have cast their ballots for Republican Donald Trump.
They were required by state law to vote for Donald Trump, who overwhelmingly carried Tennessee in November.
The vote Monday came with little fanfare. One audience member tried to read out some Scripture before the ballots were cast, but was told he could not speak.
Protesters held rallies at state Capitols around the country, including in Nashville. The group called the December 19 Coalition said it wanted to try to persuade electors to change their minds given the CIA and FBI's conclusions that Russia interfered in the presidential election with the goal of supporting Trump.
10:31 a.m.
Vermont's three members of the Electoral College are the first to report their vote for president.
All three chose Democrat Hillary Clinton, reflecting the state's vote in the Nov. 8 presidential election.
The Vermont electors are Gov. Peter Shumlin, state Rep. Tim Jerman and Martha Allen, president of the Vermont chapter of the National Education Association.
New York real estate magnate Donald Trump won the race nationally. But in Vermont, Clinton got 55.7 percent of the vote, while Trump received 29.8 percent.
Trump is poised to win 306 of the 538 electoral votes under the state-by-state distribution of electors used to choose presidents since 1789.
10:02 a.m.
Hundreds of demonstrators are gathering on the steps of Pennsylvania's Capitol building with the faint hope that they'll persuade the electors not to vote for Republican President-elect Donald Trump.
The sign-waving protesters in 25-degree weather Monday were examples of demonstrations around the country against the Electoral College's expected selection of Trump as the nation's 45th president.
Trump won Pennsylvania's popular vote, which means he gets to pick the people who cast Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes. That's fifth-most electors in the nation.
Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by less than 1 percent in Pennsylvania.
He is poised to win 306 of the 538 electoral votes under the state-by-state distribution of electors used to choose presidents since 1789.
3:16 a.m.
Electors are gathering Monday in every state to formally elect Donald Trump president even as anti-Trump forces try one last time to deny him the White House.
Protests are planned Monday in state capitals, but they're unlikely to persuade the Electoral College to dump Trump. An Associated Press survey of electors found very little appetite to vote for alternative candidates.
Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.6 million votes. But Trump is poised to win 306 of the 538 electoral votes under the state-by-state distribution of electors used to choose presidents since 1789.
The AP tried to reach every elector and interviewed more than 330 of them. Despite the national group therapy session being conducted by some Democrats, only one Republican elector told the AP that he won't vote for Trump.

Resumen: According to GasBuddy historical data, gasoline prices on December 19 in Maine have ranged widely over the last five years: $2.12/gallon in 2015, $2.61/gallon in 2014, $3.48/gallon in 2013, $3.49/gallon in 2012 and $3.34/gallon in 2011.

Texto completo:   HOULTON -- Average retail gasoline prices in Maine have risen 0.8 cents per gallon in the past week, averaging $2.30/gallon Sunday, according to GasBuddy's daily survey of 1,228 gas outlets in Maine. This compares with the national average that has increased 3.1 cents per gallon in the last week to $2.24/gallon, according to gasoline price website GasBuddy.com.
Including the change in gas prices in Maine during the past week, prices yesterday were 17.9 cents per gallon higher than the same day one year ago and are 7.2 cents per gallon higher than a month ago. The national average has increased 10.2 cents per gallon during the last month and stands 24.5 cents per gallon higher than this day one year ago.
According to GasBuddy historical data, gasoline prices on December 19 in Maine have ranged widely over the last five years: $2.12/gallon in 2015, $2.61/gallon in 2014, $3.48/gallon in 2013, $3.49/gallon in 2012 and $3.34/gallon in 2011.
Areas near Maine and their current gas price climate: Burlington- $2.30/gallon, down 0.9 cents per gallon from last week's $2.31/g; Vermont- $2.30/gallon, up 0.3 cents per gallon from last week's $2.29/gallon. New Hampshire- $2.20/gallon, up 1.8 cents per gallon from last week's $2.19/gallon.
"With West Texas Intermediate crude oil holding over $50 per barrel for the last several weeks, gasoline prices have moved higher in a majority of the country," said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst for GasBuddy. "Some 39 states saw average gasoline prices rise last week, and this week may see a similar fate at the pump as retail gasoline prices continue to play a game of catch up to the three week rally in oil prices."
"Meanwhile, it was just a year ago when the national average gas price fell under $2 per gallon for the first time since 2009, a feat unlikely to be repeated anytime soon, thanks to November's crude oil production cuts from OPEC, joined by production cuts from non-OPEC countries shortly thereafter. In fact, we're on par to see the largest December increase in gasoline prices nationally since 2010 due to the uptick in oil prices. However, those looking for respite from rising gas prices will be happy to know that prices will likely fall, at least temporarily, starting in mid-January through Valentine's Day as refiners begin discounting excess inventories of winter-grade fuel," DeHaan added.

How Trump's agenda will start showing up in Maine classrooms

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- President-elect Donald Trump has provided few details about his education policy goals but has made it clear that he intends to make changes in wide swaths that would have significant ramifications in Maine.
Trump's plan for his first 100 days in office includes just a few sentences about education policy, but it repeats some of his campaign promises: expand school choice for students, end the Common Core Education Standards, invest in vocational and technical education and make college more affordable.
Trump's pick of billionaire Betsy DeVos as his education secretary blows a stiff wind behind those goals. DeVos has long been a strong supporter of a national voucher system that would allow families access to taxpayer dollars to send their kids to private, religious or charter schools.
A major fight looms between voucher advocates and those who fear such a system would dismantle the taxpayer-funded public school system. The outcome is by no means certain, but with Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, the implementation of conservative, free-market education policy is as likely now as it has been in decades.
So what about Maine? School choice
The incoming Trump administration has allies in Maine when it comes to allowing parents to tap public education budgets to send their children to private schools.
Republican Gov. Paul LePage and mostly Republicans in the Legislature enacted a law allowing the first charter schools in Maine in 2011. Under the provisions of the bill, those charter schools are considered public.
In his 2013 state budget proposal, LePage tried to create a voucher system that would have allowed low-income students access to taxpayer funds to go to whatever school they chose, including private ones. Later that year the governor proposed a bill titled An Act to Expand School Choice for Maine Students, which ultimately failed. It would have lifted the 10-school limit on the number of charter schools in Maine, which is a proposal likely to be aired again this year, and allowed public funding to flow to private religious schools.
LePage also spearheaded legislation passed in 2013 that made it easier for students to transfer from one public school system to another.
Jim Rier, a former education commissioner under LePage, said he expects proposals this year from both sides of the school choice equation. On one hand, he expects a bill to restore the authority over district-to-district transfers fully to superintendents. He also foresees an attempt to lift the cap on charter schools.
The Maine Charter School Commission has already approved nine of the 10 schools allowed under current law. But Rier said an attempt by Trump to legislate school choice from the federal level might be met coldly in the states, especially those such as Maine, which has spent much of the past six years negotiating with the Obama administration over the state's right to exert more authority over education policy and oversight.
"A lot of people are not in favor of having the feds tell us what to do," Rier said.
Trump has said he will propose the School Choice and Education Opportunity Act within his first 100 days. It would "redirect" $20 billion in current education spending to encourage school choice. Trump states on his website that states that let students use public school dollars to attend private schools would be given preference in the grant process, which would put Maine at a disadvantage unless it changes its school choice laws.
A change in Maine's school choice laws will face staunch opposition from legislative Democrats, who control the Maine House and who just allied with the teachers union to campaign successfully for a referendum that imposes a surtax on income over $200,000 to funnel more state aid to public education.
The bulk of federal money that flows into Maine's public schools is for low-income or special-needs students, and there is the potential for a Trump presidency to alter that. Common Core
Trump has made it clear that he intends to end the Common Core State Standards, which are guidelines for what K-12 students should know and be able to do in math and English language arts. More than 40 states have voluntarily adopted the standards, including Maine, which adopted the Common Core in 2011.
Maine has seen pushes against Common Core. A group called No Common Core Maine once tried unsuccessfully to put the issue to referendum, and in 2013 a panel began but never finished an assessment of the Common Core education standards in Maine.
It's unclear what Trump could do to end the Common Core because it was a state-level initiative adopted by legislatures, though some have speculated he could change or eliminate incentives in the federal Every Student Succeeds Act to disincentivize use of the Common Core.
What would that mean for Maine? The state has its own broader set of standards for eight content areas, known as the Maine Learning Results, which were implemented in 1997. The Common Core was incorporated into the Learning Results for the 2013-14 school year. Without the Common Core, the Maine Learning Results would still be in place. College affordability
Trump has a stated goal of making college and technical schools more affordable, which is an initiative that already is being spearheaded by LePage. Tuition across the University of Maine system has been frozen for six consecutive years, making Maine the only state in the nation to reduce its inflation-adjusted tuition during the past five years. While the cost of Maine's public universities has remained flat, the national average cost of public higher education has increased 13 percent.
LePage has also chipped away at student debt by expanding Maine's educational opportunity tax credit, offering interest-free loans to students and providing tax credits to employers who help employees pay off student loans. Anything Trump can do to supplement those initiatives would likely be welcomed by lawmakers from both parties. Local control
Trump and DeVos will walk a fine line when it comes to establishing federal education policy that enhances the educational opportunities for all students while maintaining fiercely defended state-level control that has existed in the public education sector for decades. While some of their initiatives will make sense across political boundaries, others such as school choice will only fuel a bitter debate that has been ongoing for years.

Resumen: Four months into their new life in Portland, the family is beginning to settle into a predictable routine, despite the divisive politics of immigration in America. Since the American election, friends have told Alzoubi not to worry about President-elect Donald Trump, who called Syrian refugees a " Trojan horse" during the campaign.

Texto completo:   As we finish 2016, our thoughts at the BDN turn to the interesting people we met throughout the year. It's been our privilege to share the snapshots of their lives, whether uplifting, tragic or surreal, with our readers.
Yet we know the story doesn't end with our telling, and in fact, the story often changes greatly after we've told it. This makes "Whatever happened to " a common refrain not only in our newsroom, but we expect, among the public as well.
That's why, at the end of this year, we wanted to find out "whatever happened." For the next few weeks, we'll be touching base with several Mainers whose stories came to attention during the year. What we found may sadden, delight, or surprise. In all cases, we hope you enjoy them. You can read more of their stories here.

PORTLAND, Maine -- Four nights a week, Nadir Alzoubi walks to an Old Port restaurant to scrub dishes.
It's a familiar routine that stands in stark contrast to the chaos that led him here. As of Monday, it has been four years since Alzoubi and his then-pregnant wife Jamila fled Syria, looking for a safe place for their third child to be born. They had a fourth kid while struggling to get enough to eat in Jordan and in July were among the first Syrian refugees to be resettled in Maine since the outbreak of the county's civil war.
Four months into their new life in Portland, the family is beginning to settle into a predictable routine, despite the divisive politics of immigration in America.
Since the American election, friends have told Alzoubi not to worry about President-elect Donald Trump, who called Syrian refugees a " Trojan horse" during the campaign.
And he isn't worried. Rather, Alzoubi has a prayer for the next president: He hopes Trump will help other Syrians escape the tyranny of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, a prospect that has becoming increasingly unlikely as Syrian and Russian forces route the remaining rebel strongholds.
"The Syrian children and the Syrian women and the elders of Syria are asking [Trump] to help them and stand with them against this ungodly system," Alzoubi said.
But in a few short months, Alzoubi also has become aware of the fraught politics around immigration in America. He's glad he quickly found work -- mostly because it supplements the government aid his family receives and will help them more quickly rebuild their lives. But also because it bucks stereotypes about refugees that have festered and fed off a steady stream of anti-immigrant rhetoric from Trump and Gov. Paul LePage.
"The Syrians love work and activity [and] do not like laziness," Alzoubi said, translating Arabic words on his smartphone to supplement his impressionistic English, "and love to [make] friends and get to know all of the people."
Facing the many challenges of building a new life in a strange country, Alzoubi marveled at the generosity of his "friends" -- the word he uses for everyone who has lent his family aid.
The workers at Catholic Charities who helped the Alzoubis get government financial support, find a home, enroll their two older children in school and sign up for adult English classes are friends. A friends gave them a computer with the language program Rosetta Stone. Others donated many of the children's toys in the family's modest, East End apartment. And on a bright afternoon just before Thanksgiving, they waited for their friend -- a caseworker -- to drive Jamila and the four children to get government IDs.
Waiting in their sunny living room, Jamila served semolina cake while the couple's 2-year-old son, Omar, sat in the safety of his father's lap and stared wide-eyed into the lens of a BDN photographer's camera.
Nadir urged his two older daughters to show off the English they are learning in school. But the girls were shy, and their murmurs had to compete with the sound of an Arabic-language news program coming from the TV.
After several minutes of listening to an anchorwoman talk over footage of tanks and a bombed out Syrian city, Alzoubi stood and switched the channel to a children's program.
"Always too much of that," he said.

Texto completo:   The Point writer Christopher Burns, "Your house was likely built with Canadian lumber, and it's reigniting a trade war":
If Canadian lumber is cheaper, then tariffs would increase the cost of houses for a lot more people than would benefit from the tariffs in the U.S. lumber industry. Everything is a trade-off.
-- GrumpyJim
Our congressional delegation is more worried about climate change, transgender bathrooms, fake news, safe zones, microaggressions and the list goes on. I built a new house in Maine in 2009, and I had a local company mill all the wood and siding. It felt good to keep money in Maine.
-- downbeat2
It's easy to spot Canadian lumber; all the 2x4s look like hockey sticks.
-- Leeroy Zwolf
In order for it to be effective, the tariff would have to be greater than 35 percent. Also, we would have to tell them that the tariff will not be refunded in a few years, like we did 10 years ago when the U.S. government paid back all the countervailing duty paid by Canadian producers, resulting in millions of dollars injected directly into the Canadian mills.
-- Snowluvr
I built a house two years ago. Most of it was built with Moose River lumber, which is near Jackman. The 2x6s and 2x10s were all stamped with "Made in USA." I think the 2x4s used in the interior walls might have been Canadian, but I don't remember. Exterior walls, floor joists, roof trusses, flooring underlayment were all sourced from Maine.
-- hiker
Don't forget much of the wood business is cross-border, so restrictions may hurt Maine as much as help.
-- CanAmSteve
It's the story of all the trade agreements: Only U.S. exporters have to follow the rules.
-- Robert Snow
Basic economics say that as the price of a commodity goes up the demand goes down. If lumber becomes more expensive, as it evidently will with trade restrictions, there will be less construction, meaning fewer jobs and fewer building projects. Maine's lumber industry reflects the advantages and disadvantages of Donald Trump's policies, at least from what we can infer from his various and often contradictory pronouncements. Some people will come out ahead and some people will lose in Trump's interference in the economy.
-- JessThinkin
This is old news but keep it coming anyway to remind people. Anybody that watched "American Loggers" saw Maine logs being hauled to Canada every day. That's one way free trade doesn't work so well for the United States. I figured the battle was already lost years ago. I don't see how Donald Trump can change our entrenched, one-way free trade policies.
-- common_since
After Donald Trump takes over its likely will be seeing an influx of Russian lumber under the Ikea name.
-- Stan Smith
Better to deforest Canada than Maine.
-- North Woods Gnome
That's OK because our warships are being built with Canadian steel.
-- Bowdoin
Some of us don't understand why there never was a sawmill in Millinockett.
-- RHW59Maine
This article should have stated clearly that the Quebec sawmills that process logs harvested in Maine are not subsidized. If there is no exemption for Maine logs, it will hurt Maine landowners and loggers. Pleasant River Lumber, which was interviewed in the article, is disingenuous. They are using the issue to stifle competition to favor themselves at the expense of all other Mainers. That's blatant misrepresentation.

Driver strikes police cruisers, injures officer on I-295
A minivan driver was arrested early Sunday morning after striking two police cruisers and injuring a Yarmouth police officer on Interstate 295 in Yarmouth, police said.
At 2:51 a.m., police cruisers from Yarmouth and Freeport were at the scene of a tractor-trailer accident at mile 17, where the northbound lanes had been shut down to remove the truck, police said.
A Honda minivan operated by Connor Fitzsimmons of Topsham, which was traveling north, did not stop for the road closure and struck the cruisers, police said.
Falmouth and Cumberland police also responded to the scene.
Fitzsimmons was arrested by Cumberland police and charged with operating under the influence. He was taken to the Cumberland County Jail.
Yarmouth police Officer Derek Lukas was injured and taken to Maine Medical Center with injuries not considered life-threatening. He was treated and released.

U.S. Attorney's Office collects $3.7 million in fiscal 2016
Federal prosecutors say the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maine collected more than $3.7 million in criminal and civil actions in fiscal year 2016.
U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Delahanty II said about $1.1 million was collected in criminal actions and $2.6 million was from civil actions.
He said the district also worked with other U.S. Attorney's Offices and the federal Department of Justice to collect more than $900,000 in jointly pursued cases. The vast majority of that amount is from civil actions.
The Justice Department collected more than $15 billion in civil and criminal actions in total for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. The 94 U.S. Attorney's Offices and the main litigating divisions of the Justice Department have a combined budget of a little less than $3 billion.

Club equips game wardens with mapping software
The Maine Warden Service is getting new mapping software courtesy of a hunting and fishing club in Westbrook.
Forest City Rod & Gun Club is providing enough DeLorme Earthmate software programs for every Maine game warden. Earthmate is a GPS navigation app designed for mobile devices with detailed GPS trip logging, location sharing and tracking.
The announcement was made last week at an annual Game Warden Appreciation night.
Maine's chief game warden, Col. Joel Wilkinson, said the gift will help wardens during search and rescue missions "and could possibly save lives."
The 100-member-strong Forest City Rod and Gun Club in Westbrook was established in 1948 and remains one of Maine's oldest clubs of its kind.

Texto completo:   UMaine men's basketball vs. Quinnipiac
The University of Maine men's basketball team wasted a dominant defensive performance in the first half with a lackluster showing in the second and lost to Quinnipiac 85-75 Sunday at Cross Insurance Arena.
"The story of the game was the second half," said Maine Coach Bob Walsh. "You give up 60 percent shooting, you give up 57 points in the second, you've got no business talking about winning. I'm just really disappointed in our team - in myself and in our group."
Maine led 36-28 at the end of the first half, riding 20 points from its bench before the break. Junior guard Wes Myers led the way off the bench, scoring 10 points of his game-high 21 points in the first half.
The Black Bears limited the Bobcats to 34.4 percent shooting in the first half. Even with the impressive start, Maine missed opportunities to take a bigger lead, surrendering 11 offensive rebounds in the half. Abdulai Bundu (12 points, nine rebounds) wreaked the most havoc on the glass for the Bobcats, snagging five offensive rebounds - which resulted in all seven of his first-half points.
In total, Quinnipiac - which held a significant size advantage in the front court - won the rebound battle, 43-29.
"It wasn't really them being bigger than us," said Maine freshman Andrew Fleming. "We work on rebounding every day in practice, and we want to be competitive and show toughness on the boards and we just didn't do that today."
Senior forward Marko Pirovic also provided a spark off the bench - and he did it on both ends of the floor. After running a trap zone defense for the first 15 minutes, the Black Bears switched to a full-court press as the Bobcats started to claw back.
On the first possession after the switch, Pirovic stepped into a passing lane and came away with a steal near half court. The 6-foot-7 forward flashed some impressive ball handling skills driving toward the hoop and making a layup after using a Eurostep to beat the lone defender in front of him.
Two possessions later, the senior slid out of the paint and unleashed a catch-and-shoot 3.
The only starter to score in double figures for Maine was Fleming - a freshman who starred at Oxford Hills. Fleming finished with 11 points, eight rebounds, three assists and two blocks.
Quinnipiac took its first lead just over four minutes into the second on a 3-pointer by Daniel Harris.
Chaise Daniels finished with 17 points and nine rebounds, while Mike Dixon finished with 16 points for Quinnipiac.
The game started to slip away from Maine midway through the second half, but Ilker Er knocked down 3s on back-to-back possessions to cut the Black Bears deficit to just two, 61-59, with 8:40 left. From there the Bobcats came to life again, stretching their lead into double digits and leading by as many as 13 down the stretch.
"The competitive edge we had in the first was really good," said Walsh. "We fought and fought and fought. In the second half they controlled the edge of the game and we couldn't match it or catch up to it. They did what they wanted to offensively. They just went really hard when they were in transition, when they attacked off the dribble, when they went to the offensive glass - there was just a different compete edge to them."

Texto completo:   Portland is expected to continue providing general assistance to immigrants who do not meet the state's eligibility for being lawfully present. But Portland will seek a state reimbursement for that aid. Instead, it will be funded through local tax dollars.
Maine's largest city is expected to continue providing General Assistance to immigrants who do not qualify for those benefits under state rules.
But Portland will not seek state reimbursement for the General Assistance spending on some would-be asylum seekers, including those who are working on an application for asylum but simply haven't filed it.
Instead, aid to those immigrants and others who are deemed ineligible under new state rules will be paid for entirely with local tax dollars, said City Councilor Belinda Ray, the incoming chairwoman of the council's Health and Human Services Committee.
"We have funds set aside to address people the state has deemed not eligible," Ray said Friday. She said no one will lose assistance - only the funding sources will change.
On Monday, the City Council will consider a proposal to change its General Assistance ordinance to align its eligibility requirements with new state rules finalized this year. General Assistance is a safety net program of last resort for people who need vouchers for emergency food, shelter and other necessities. It's funded through a combination of state and local funds.
"This (ordinance change) is purely to make it clear that we are eligible for the reimbursements we seek," Ray said.
Disagreements between Portland and the state have already cost the city millions of dollars.
A state law enacted last year granted eligibility for anyone "who is lawfully present in the United States or who is pursuing a lawful process to apply for immigration relief." Assistance was capped at two years.
Federal law allows noncitizens to file for asylum within one year of entering the United States, regardless of how they arrived in the country. The vast majority of asylum seekers in Maine arrive in the U.S. on student, work or visitation visas that expire within six months, meaning they have six months to complete the long and complicated asylum application before facing deportation.
Federal law also prohibits asylum seekers from receiving legal work permits for at least six months after they apply. And many asylum seekers wait years for interviews with immigration officials because of a growing national backlog.
The council revised its ordinance months before the state rules were finalized. While it anticipated some of the rules, the council's October 2015 action deemed someone eligible for General Assistance who was in the U.S. for less than a year but hadn't filed an application. However, the rules released by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services in May deemed those noncitizens ineligible.
Other groups previously deemed eligible for state assistance, but who now will receive local assistance, include parents or guardians of American-born children, as well as unaccompanied minors - a federal designation for children who crossed the border without a legal guardian.
After the new state rules were released in May, immigrant advocates, including Maine Equal Justice Partners, said they were considering filing a lawsuit over the state's interpretation of the law. Neither Robyn Merrill, executive director of Maine Equal Justice Partners, nor Sue Roche, director of the Legal Immigrant Advocacy Project, could be reached for comment.
The pending council action is the latest chapter in what has been a long - and costly - disagreement between Portland and the administration of Gov. Paul LePage, which in 2014 sought to cutprevent immigrants who enter the country legally and then apply for political asylum from receiving state benefits until they are able to receive federal authorization to work.
After the initial effort failed through the official state rule-making process, the administration later informed municipalities that it would simply no longer reimburse communities that continued to provide assistance to asylum seekers, citing a federal law enacted under President Bill Clinton in 1996.
Portland, along with the Maine Municipal Association, sued the administration over the action and ultimately received a split ruling from a Superior Court judge. Justice Thomas Warren ruled on June 9, 2015, that the administration was able to withhold the disputed reimbursement from municipalities, since the Maine Legislature had not enacted a bill making asylum seekers eligible. However, Warren also ruled that the administration should have followed proper rule-making procedures, which it didn't do.
Portland and the MMA ultimately decided not to appeal - or seek clarification on - the ruling. City officials estimate that Portland lost roughly $3 million in fiscal year 2015 because of the lawsuit. However, the city recently settled a separate lawsuit with the state over its homeless shelter operations, receiving $1.3 million from the state.
After the ruling, the Legislature passed a bill making some noncitizens eligible for General Assistance. LePage mistakenly missed a deadline to fulfill his promise to veto the bill and it went into law. A subsequent effort to force a statewide referendum to overturn it was aborted.
During last year's budget process, Portland allocated $250,000 for an estimated 90 immigrants that it expected would not be deemed eligible under the state program. Those individuals include immigrants who have not filed an asylum application.
Through September, the city had spent about $68,000 of those funds, plus an estimated $20,000 more in October, according to City Manager Jon Jennings.
City officials say the fund helped 34 families, totaling 54 individuals, in September, and 38 families, totaling 48 individuals, in October.
Continuing to help those excluded from the state program by using local funds would be an annual budget decision for the City Council.
If the policy continues, the cost could increase to $265,000 in the next budget, according to Jessica Grondin, the city's communications director.
"I will continue to push for it every year," Mayor Ethan Strimling said. "These are our neighbors. These are the people who are building our economy."
Also on Monday, the council will vote on creating a new Office of Economic Opportunity. Randy Billings can be contacted at 791-6346 or at: rbillings@pressherald.com Twitter: randybillings

Electric short caused large Charlestown fire
The six-alarm Charlestown fire early Friday morning was triggered when wiring in the ground-floor ceiling shorted, officials said. Investigators traced the origin of the blaze to the ceiling above a first-floor laundromat in the mixed-use building, according to Boston Fire Department spokesman Stephen MacDonald. The short happened just before 6:45 a.m., sparking the blaze before the business opened, MacDonald said. Flames burned in the ceiling briefly before crawling up and consuming six apartments on the second and third floors. Intense flames blew out windows and caused the roof to cave in about one to two hours into the four hours it took for 100 firefighters to put out the fire, MacDonald said.

Underground fire turns manholes into missiles
An underground fire caused multiple manhole explosions in downtown Malden Sunday afternoon, resulting in power outages in the area, according to Malden Fire Department. Bill Sullivan, Malden Fire Department assistant chief, said four manhole covers on Main Street were sent flying between noon and 3 p.m. Smoke and flames poured from the manholes near Malden High School, Sullivan said. Some flames reached 8 to 10 feet high, he added. Malden Police Capitan Glenn Cronin said no injuries were reported, but one man reported that one of the manhole covers damaged his vehicle. Firefighters evacuated businesses and residences in a two-block radius around the explosions near the intersection of Florence and Main streets, Cronin said. He said the area has since been deemed safe to walk or drive. National Grid said power should be totally restored by early Monday morning.

Lone N.E. elector for Trump not wavering
The only Republican presidential elector in New England says some voters don't realize the election is over. Maine Republican Chairman Rick Bennett says he's catching heat from those who want him to withhold his support of Donald Trump in hopes of denying him the presidency, when the Electoral College votes Monday. Bennett is the only Republican elector from Maine to New Jersey. Maine split its electoral votes for the first time. One congressional district supported Trump in the election, while the other and the statewide tally favored Democrat Hillary Clinton. There's no penalty for voting for someone else, but Bennett said he will cast his vote for the president-elect because that's the will of voters in the Second Congressional District. (AP)

Infestation of flies will keep high school closed
Chelsea High School will remain closed Monday and Tuesday as administrators work into a second week to control a fly infestation caused by cracked pipes under the school's foundation. To fix the problem, engineers will have to cut through the concrete foundation and fix at least four broken or cracked pipes underneath, Chelsea Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Mary Bourque wrote on the school district's website. The school had previously been closed on Thursday and Friday as administrators conducted a video investigation of the pipes. The school received permission Friday to hire a contractor to cut through the concrete, fix the pipes, and restore the concrete. Bourque said she will decide on Tuesday afternoon whether to keep the school closed on Wednesday. The school will be closed for December recess from Dec. 26 to Jan. 3.

Texto completo:   Freezing cold and snow followed by a thaw and rain fouled plans and roads across central Maine in the last weekend before Christmas.
Single digit temperatures forecast for central Maine on Monday morning
MANCHESTER -- The whipsawing weather conditions that broke a record for the low temperature in Augusta on Friday and rebounded to produce rain Sunday afternoon are expected to plunge again into freezing territory in the first part of the week.
That poses a challenge for Robert Cunningham, who has set up a Christmas tree lot at Mulligan's in Manchester. On Saturday, with snow falling and temperatures in the single digits, business was slow.
"There weren't many people in the cold," Cunningham, of Pittston, said. The bitter cold on Friday and Saturday and the snow on Saturday kept people home.
In all, Andy Pohl, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Gray, said 4 to 6 inches of snow fell across the region. Warming temperatures overnight Saturday into Sunday turned precipitation to rain and caused icing on vehicles and roads throughout central Maine before the ice started melting in late morning.
"That's the good news," Pohl said. "Then we have the bad news."
A cold front pushing through the region Sunday evening was expected to push the temperature below freezing again, and by Monday's morning commute, it's expected to be in the single digits.
Pohl, who checked weather records Sunday, said Augusta's low temperature of minus 9 Friday broke a record that had stood in the capital city since 1951, when the low bottomed out at minus 5 degrees.
And it's not even winter yet.
Even so, the swing in temperatures has taken a toll on buildings.
Following a broken water pipe that caused significant damage to the Waterville Public Library on Saturday, a pipe burst Sunday in City Center's Lecture Room in Augusta, sending gallons of water through both it and the employee exercise room and a record storage room below it.
Augusta City Manager Bill Bridgeo, who happened to be passing the City Center around 10:30 a.m. on his way to take doughnuts to the city's Public Works crews who had been out all night, saw the fire trucks at the city hall and stopped to see what had happened.
Workers using shop vacs and fans cleared up the mess Sunday, and an insurance adjuster is expected to assess the damage this week.
Bridgeo said electronic backups exist of some of the records damaged by water, and others are being dried out with the help of a dehumidifier.
"We won't know what the damage is until we take a closer look," he said, and it's too soon to estimate the cost of the damage.
As for the Public Works Department, Bridgeo said it did as well as other departments around the region.
The weekend's weather caused a rash of accidents across the region that stretched into Sunday.
Maine State Police Sgt. Blaine Bronson said more than a dozen accidents, mostly slide-offs, kept troopers occupied along the interstate corridors.
"Mostly the cause was poor tires or driving too fast," Bronson said. In some cases, the vehicles were equipped with four-wheel drive, but the drivers weren't using it.
While four-wheel drive doesn't work on ice, he said, it does work on Sunday's slushy conditions.
While most accidents were minor, Blaine said a wreck on Interstate 95 northbound in Clinton sent a juvenile male to MaineGeneral Medical Center in Waterville with a broken leg Sunday morning. Around 8:40 a.m., the driver of a vehicle lost control in front of a tractor trailer and was struck.
The male driver, Bronson said, was not injured.
No accidents were reported in northern Kennebec County and into southern Somerset County Sunday.
In Augusta, police Sgt. Christian Behr said more accidents were reported Saturday than Sunday, but there were reports of wires down that seemed to be weather-related.
Central Maine Power showed no unusual outages during the day.
Pohl said temperatures are expected to moderate mid-week to usher in the start of winter at 5:44 a.m. Wednesday.
"The next system will come in on Thursday to Friday. The overnight lows Thursday will be around freezing, but we'll have to wait and see what happens."
That system is likely to determine whether central Maine will have a white Christmas, he said.
In the meantime Cunningham, with his lot full of trees, said Sunday that last weekend should have been his busiest weekend, but it was not and he's not sure why. By mid-afternoon Sunday, business appeared to be picking up with several groups of people stopping by to look over his selection.
In the final stretch to Christmas, he said he hopes to sell around 400 trees.
"It's a fair business," he said, "but you know year to year what it will be."

Texto completo:   PORTLAND -- The University of Maine men's basketball team wasted a dominant defensive first half on Sunday by following it up with a lackluster showing in the second as they lost to Quinnipiac, 85-75, at Cross Insurance Arena.
"The story of the game was the second half" said Maine coach Bob Walsh. "You give up 60 percent shooting, you give up 57 points in the second, you've got no business talking about winning. I'm just really disappointed in our team -- in myself and in our group."
Maine took a 36-28 lead into the half, riding 20 points from its bench before the break. Junior guard Wes Myers led the way off the bench, pouring in 10 of his game-high 21 points.
The Black Bears limited the Bobcats to 34.4 percent shooting in the first half. Even with the impressive start, Maine had missed opportunities to take a bigger lead into the locker room, surrendering 11 offensive rebounds in the half. Abdulai Bundu (12 points, nine rebounds) wreaked the most havoc on the glass for the Bobcats, snagging five offensive rebounds -- which resulted in all seven of his half points.
In total, Quinnipiac, which held a significant size advantage in the front court, won the battle on the glass by a margin of 43 rebounds to just 29.
"It wasn't really on them being bigger than us," said Maine freshman Andrew Fleming. "We work on rebounding every day in practice, and we want to be competitive and show toughness on the boards and we just didn't do that today."
Senior forward Marko Pirovic joined Myers in providing a spark off the bench -- and he did it on both ends of the floor with the second unit on Sunday. After running a trap zone defense for the first 15 minutes of play, the Black Bears switched to a full-court press defense as the Bobcats clawed back from early offensive struggles.
On the first possession after the switch, Pirovic stepped into a passing lane and came away with a steal near half court. The 6-foot-7 forward flashed some impressive ball handling skills driving toward the hoop, finally finishing a lay-up after using a Eurostep to beat the lone defender in front of him.
Two possessions later, the senior slid out from the paint on offense and unleashed a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer as part of a 10-point showing.
The only starter to score in double figures for the Black Bears was Fleming -- a true freshman who starred at Oxford Hills before heading to Maine. Fleming finished with 11 points, eight rebounds, three assists and two blocks in the loss.
The Bobcats came out of the break looking to push the pace of play more, and it resulted in a more in-sync offensive attack. Quinnipiac took its first lead of the night just over four minutes into the second half on a Daniel Harris 3-pointer from the top of the key.
Chaise Daniels (17 points, nine rebounds) and Mikey Dixon (16 points) helped pace the Quinnipiac offense throughout.
The game started to slip away from Maine midway through the half, but Ilker Er knocked down 3s on back-to-back possessions to cut the Black Bears deficit to just two. From there the Bobcats came to life again, growing their lead into double digits and led by as many as 13 down the stretch.
"The competitive edge we had in the first was really good," said Walsh. "We fought and fought and fought. In the second half they controlled the edge of the game and we couldn't match it or catch up to it. They did what they wanted to offensively. They just went really hard when they were in transition, when they attacked off the dribble, when they went to the offensive glass -- there was just a different compete edge to them."

Texto completo:   More than 1,000 jobs in Maine's York County directly depend on continuation of fighter program
President-elect Donald Trump's tweet lambasting the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program as "out of control" has created worries in York County, where the program supports nearly 1,000 jobs.
"The F-35 program and cost is out of control," Trump tweeted last week, causing shares of manufacturer Lockheed Martin to tumble 3 percent. "Billions of dollars can be saved on military (and other) purchases after Jan. 20," the day he becomes president.
Engine components for the F-35 are made at Pratt & Whitney's North Berwick facility, and other parts are made at General Dynamics in Saco. The F-35 program employs 960 Mainers directly or indirectly and injects $84 million into the Maine economy each year, according to a joint statement sent to the Maine Sunday Telegram by U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King.
"That contract provides security for Pratt & Whitney and literally hundreds of jobs for people who wake up and go to work every day to provide for their families," said former Maine House Speaker Mark Eves, who lives in North Berwick. "If it were to go away, it would be pretty devastating for people's ability to bring home a good paycheck."
The F-35 generated such demand for precision machinists that York County Community College in Wells created a program in 2013 to train them, even though there were already similar programs at two other Maine community colleges. "Sometimes students are offered jobs while they are still students," said college president Barbara Finkelstein. "We have to press on them that we'd like to get them the degrees."
It's not the first time Trump has criticized the F-35, a program that now costs $400 billion, about twice initial estimates. In October 2015, Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt the plane doesn't perform as well as the much less expensive aircraft it is slated to replace. "What are we doing, and spending so much more money?" he said.
The F-35 has been troubled. Originally intended to be an inexpensive, adaptable and reliable aircraft that could be used by the Navy, Air Force, Marines and our overseas allies, it has turned into one of the most expensive in history and notoriously unreliable. The Pentagon had to ground all F-35s at least 13 times between 2007 and 2014, mostly because of problems with Pratt & Whitney's engine turbine blades.
Trump may discover that the program is almost impossible to kill because the work has been spread around almost every state and so has near-universal congressional support. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for instance, fought hard to ensure an F-35 wing will be deployed with the Vermont National Guard in Burlington in 2020.
"For better or worse, that is the plane of record right now, and it is not gonna be discarded," he told a local reporter in 2015. "That's the reality."
In Maine, the F-35 work at Pratt & Whitney has been championed by Republican Collins and independent King, as well as Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree (who fought against funding for a rival Rolls-Royce engine) and Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who suggested Lockheed should move production work to the former Brunswick Naval Air Station to shorten supply chains.
LePage, a supporter of Trump, declined to comment on the president-elect's tweet. "Neither the Governor or anyone else can speculate on what the President-Elect may or may not do," his spokeswoman, Adrienne Bennett, said by email.
Eves suggested the governor should use any influence he might have with the president-elect to protect the F-35. "If he has any sway with the incoming administration, now would be the time to use it and to talk about what would be the impact," he said.
In their statement, Collins and King praised the F-35 as "the world's most advanced, multi-role fighter aircraft" and "a critical component of our national security. The value of the F-35 program is demonstrated by the fact that costs are coming down and our allies share the burden of the costs."
"While there were initial overruns, costs have been reduced significantly since the program's inception, and it is projected to be less expensive than existing, less capable aircraft in fewer than four years," the senators said.
Pingree said the F-35 has been debated for years, "many concerns about costs have been raised, many have been addressed, and there's little to be accomplished in going over that same ground yet again. I think it's critical that this project continue to move forward so we can replace America's aging fleet of fighters and support good-paying jobs in Maine."
"If President-elect Trump is looking to address wasteful Defense spending, I have many ideas," she added Tuesday. "Last week's report that the Pentagon covered up its own plan to identify $125 billion in savings would be just the first."
A spokesman at Pratt & Whitney's corporate headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut, declined to comment.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND -- The University of Maine men's basketball team wasted a dominant defensive first half on Sunday by following it up with a lackluster showing in the second as they lost to Quinnipiac, 85-75, at Cross Insurance Arena.
"The story of the game was the second half" said Maine coach Bob Walsh. "You give up 60 percent shooting, you give up 57 points in the second, you've got no business talking about winning. I'm just really disappointed in our team -- in myself and in our group."
Maine took a 36-28 lead into the half, riding 20 points from its bench before the break. Junior guard Wes Myers led the way off the bench, pouring in 10 of his game-high 21 points.
The Black Bears limited the Bobcats to 34.4 percent shooting in the first half. Even with the impressive start, Maine had missed opportunities to take a bigger lead into the locker room, surrendering 11 offensive rebounds in the half. Abdulai Bundu (12 points, nine rebounds) wreaked the most havoc on the glass for the Bobcats, snagging five offensive rebounds -- which resulted in all seven of his half points.
In total, Quinnipiac, which held a significant size advantage in the front court, won the battle on the glass by a margin of 43 rebounds to just 29.
"It wasn't really on them being bigger than us," said Maine freshman Andrew Fleming. "We work on rebounding every day in practice, and we want to be competitive and show toughness on the boards and we just didn't do that today."
Senior forward Marko Pirovic joined Myers in providing a spark off the bench -- and he did it on both ends of the floor with the second unit on Sunday. After running a trap zone defense for the first 15 minutes of play, the Black Bears switched to a full-court press defense as the Bobcats clawed back from early offensive struggles.
On the first possession after the switch, Pirovic stepped into a passing lane and came away with a steal near half court. The 6-foot-7 forward flashed some impressive ball handling skills driving toward the hoop, finally finishing a lay-up after using a Eurostep to beat the lone defender in front of him.
Two possessions later, the senior slid out from the paint on offense and unleashed a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer as part of a 10-point showing.
The only starter to score in double figures for the Black Bears was Fleming -- a true freshman who starred at Oxford Hills before heading to Maine. Fleming finished with 11 points, eight rebounds, three assists and two blocks in the loss.
The Bobcats came out of the break looking to push the pace of play more, and it resulted in a more in-sync offensive attack. Quinnipiac took its first lead of the night just over four minutes into the second half on a Daniel Harris 3-pointer from the top of the key.
Chaise Daniels (17 points, nine rebounds) and Mikey Dixon (16 points) helped pace the Quinnipiac offense throughout.
The game started to slip away from Maine midway through the half, but Ilker Er knocked down 3s on back-to-back possessions to cut the Black Bears deficit to just two. From there the Bobcats came to life again, growing their lead into double digits and led by as many as 13 down the stretch.
"The competitive edge we had in the first was really good," said Walsh. "We fought and fought and fought. In the second half they controlled the edge of the game and we couldn't match it or catch up to it. They did what they wanted to offensively. They just went really hard when they were in transition, when they attacked off the dribble, when they went to the offensive glass -- there was just a different compete edge to them."

Texto completo: HARTFORD, Conn. - Federal, state and local officials in Connecticut are voicing opposition to a plan by federal railroad regulators to rebuild the congested Northeast Corridor over the coming decades.
While praising the Federal Railroad Administration for wanting to fix crumbling infrastructure and reduce travel times along the Washington-Boston route, officials say Friday's plan still devastates Connecticut shoreline communities, despite some changes, including a proposed tunnel under the Connecticut River and Old Lyme.
Local activists plan to continue fighting the plan's proposed 50-mile bypass from Old Saybrook to Rhode Island.
Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal calls the plan unaffordable and dead on arrival, urging the administration to instead improve existing rail lines.
Department of Transportation Commissioner James Redeker says no Northeast Corridor project can move forward in Connecticut without the state signing off.
Plan for imperiled shark doesn't please all conservationists
ORTLAND, Maine - A group of conservationists says a federal plan to protect a threatened shark that lives in East Coast waters doesn't go far enough.
The National Marine Fisheries Service is proposing changes to federal fishing rules with the goal of protecting dusky sharks. The species is a large shark that lost much of its population due to commercial fishing for them that's now illegal off the U.S.
The fisheries service is proposing a suite of new rules for recreational and commercial fishermen that are designed to protect the shark, which is sometimes still killed by accidental bycatch. But conservation group Oceana says the rules aren't strict enough, and leave sharks vulnerable.
Dusky sharks live from Maine to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico on the East Coast. They have long been hunted for fins.
US agency seeks to expand national refuge in New England
MONTPELIER, Vt. - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to expand by tens of thousands of acres a national refuge that covers parts of the Connecticut River watershed in New England.
The federal agency released its 15-year conservation plan Friday for the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, which covers more than 37,000 acres in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut.
The plan includes a proposal to seek authority for the agency to buy up to more than 197,000 acres from interested property owners, about double the amount Fish and Wildlife currently has the authority to acquire.
The refuge, named after the late congressman from Massachusetts, was established in 1997 to conserve, protect and enhance Connecticut River populations of native species of plants, fish and wildlife. The refuge provides habitat for numerous animals, including Atlantic salmon, river herring, bald eagles, peregrine falcons and osprey.
After nearly 45 years, new NYC subway faces deadline to open
NEW YORK - Nearly 45 years since construction started, a New York subway line beneath Manhattan's east side faces a Dec.31 deadline to open.
Experts say that after decades of blown benchmarks, it won't much matter if the nearly 2-mile stretch of Second Avenue subway doesn't open exactly on time.
But they say completing the much-needed subway extension won't just unclog the tracks, but also could restore the public's faith in government.
About 5.6million riders take the city's subways every day.
Ridership on Manhattan's only north-south subway line on the east side has been surging, with overcrowded trains straining the system and causing delays that ripple throughout the city's underground.

Texto completo: Enfield — Eastern Propone & Oil, which had been operating out of temporary offices in Lebanon, has opened a new office and storage facility on Hathorn Road in Enfield, to expand operations in the Upper Valley. “This gives us a footprint in Enfield, Lebanon, Hanover, Canaan and across the river in Vermont,” said Josh Anderson, Eastern’s vice president of sales and marketing.
The move follows Eastern’s purchase a couple years ago of Patriot Fuels in Enfield and its move into the Upper Valley market.
The family-owned Rochester, N.H.-based company until now has principally been serving the Upper Valley out of its Claremont facility, but the new Enfield facility, when completed, will include a four-bay garage and two 30,000-gallon storage tanks, said district manager Mark Limoges, who will oversee both facilities. The Enfield station — the eighth location for Eastern — will employ about 10 people, Limoges said, and serve the company’s approximately 4,000 customers in Grafton County.
Eastern has 85,000 customers in total.
Eastern, founded in 1932, distributes propane and fuel oil to homes and businesses in New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont.

Resumen: Monitor staff The drought of 2016 might have put a crimp in the state's population of Lyme disease-carrying ticks, but it's too soon to say whether that will reduce the number of cases of the disease itself. “When I checked for black-legged ticks in October, I could find very few even though I picked ideal times, so I had to conclude that a whole bunch of the nymphs did not survive the drought,” said Alan Eaton of UNH Cooperative Extension, a well-known state expert on ticks and insects. Because ticks are flat, they can be dried out and killed by a stretch of hot, dry weather. Between 2,600 and 3,200 reports are sent each year to DHHS by medical providers and other sources through a variety of means, including phone calls and faxes, and they have to be checked individually, said Abigail Mathewson, public health program manager.

The drought of 2016 might have put a crimp in the state's population of Lyme disease-carrying ticks, but it's too soon to say whether that will reduce the number of cases of the disease itself.
“When I checked for black-legged ticks in October, I could find very few even though I picked ideal times, so I had to conclude that a whole bunch of the nymphs did not survive the drought,” said Alan Eaton of UNH Cooperative Extension, a well-known state expert on ticks and insects.
Because ticks are flat, they can be dried out and killed by a stretch of hot, dry weather. Black-legged ticks, the main carrier of Lyme, are relatively small and more susceptible to desiccation than larger species such as dog ticks, raising hopes that the current drought might cut numbers.
Eaton said his work supports that hope, since his sampling found relatively few black-legged ticks in the state's southeast third, including parts of Merrimack County, where the drought has hit hardest. In wetter parts of the state, including parts of the Lakes Region, he said tick populations appeared to be “normal or nearly normal.”
Even within dry regions there was variation, as ticks can survive drought if there is leaf litter or other protection for them to hide under.
“Places that were slightly wetter, moister, the populations were normal,” Eaton said.
When snow melts in the spring, he said, people shouldn't be complacent but should continue with tick prevention strategies, including wearing long pants in fields and woods, and checking themselves for ticks afterward.
It's unclear whether the population trend has cut new cases of Lyme disease because New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services is still tallying reports of the disease from 2016.
Between 2,600 and 3,200 reports are sent each year to DHHS by medical providers and other sources through a variety of means, including phone calls and faxes, and they have to be checked individually, said Abigail Mathewson, public health program manager.
“We're working on ways to better estimate them. This is hard when we have so few people,” she said.
So far, she said, 876 cases of the disease have been confirmed. That is far less than last year's tally of 1,371 or the peak figure of 1,681 in 2013, but the 2016 cases are certain to rise because many reports still have to be studied.
In Maine, which also suffered from heavy drought, the disease wasn't affected this year. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention says reported cases of Lyme actually rose by 12 percent from 2015. 
Eaton says he saw one worrying trend in New Hampshire this year. People sometimes send him ticks to identify that they have pulled off themselves. This year, he said, all the samples sent to him were engorged with blood, meaning they had been attached to a person and feeding for a long time before they were removed.
“Every single one of them was engorged. Usually in past years, a significant number were flat, which means they were pulled off quickly,” he said. “I'm afraid a lot of people aren't looking, aren't checking themselves for ticks. Maybe we're being lulled into a false sense of safety and security, so we're discovering the ticks much later than we would have.”
A tick must be attached for at least 24 or 36 hours before the virus that causes the disease can be passed into the person.

Resumen: Electoral votes in 48 states are under a "winner-take-all" system that awards all the electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote of that state. Under such a scheme, they reasoned, it would be highly unlikely that any one person would win a majority of the electoral vote and, failing that, the House of Representatives would decide the election between the five leading candidates - with each state having one vote. [...]the Founders believed that the Electoral College, made up of distinguished and selfless men, would onlychoose presidents who understood and would govern on behalf of the public good. In the debate over the ratification of the Constitution, Alexander Hamilton mounted a powerful defense of the Electoral College, believing it to be a screening institution that would provide a safeguard against candidates for president whose "Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity" might give...

Texto completo: WOOSTER — As an artist and fellow downtown merchant, Mackenzie Haiss said she was really sorry to see The Gallery in the Vault go out of business earlier this year.
And at the same time, Haiss was looking to get back to her business and artistic roots. She started in business more than 30 years ago as Mackenzie’s Silver Lining before concentrating solely on her jewelry design business, which has operated as Mackenzie’s Silver & Gold.
Now, it seemed, was a good time to go back. “Mackenzie’s Silver Lining is more whimsical,” she said, “and because I’m a positive person, so there’s a silver lining.”
In addition to her own work and some acquired items, Haiss reached out to fellow artists, who have brought their own photography, pottery and miscellaneous creations to her East Liberty Street shop. She is open to all media, and said the change has been inspiring to her. “Just the artwork all around, the local artists, it just intrigues me, what they’re doing,” she said. “I love all the color I have in here now.”
And then she put up a shelf, just for her friend and employee Bette Lee Murray.
The timing was right for her, too.
Martin first met Haiss more than 30 years ago, when she brought some beads in to have strung. Eventually, she began beading herself, with Haiss doing the finish work, and then joined her behind the counter. It worked out well, Haiss said, “because the beads are small, it makes my eyes tired,” and because it freed her to spend more time on setting stones and soldering.
Eventually, Haiss found there was little Murray couldn’t do. She painted in watercolors, oils and acrylics, she sewed, she worked with clay, she worked with glass beads and shells.
And one day, quite serendipitously, Murray discovered paper clay, which is smooth and softer to work with than traditional clay. “It hardens just like the consistency of clay,” Murray said. “But you don’t have to have a kiln.”
In a magazine, she saw cute figurines with torsos created from old tins and paper clay faces and legs. Murray, it seemed, had discovered her niche.
She started making her own clay-and-tin creations while still working at Frito-Lay in Wooster. But when she retired a few years ago, her art easily filled in those former work hours.
It helps that she and her husband haunt antique stores and malls from Maine to Florida to Wisconsin. They are collectors of stoneware, Murray said, “but now we’re looking for cans on top of that.”
She finds plenty, at a variety of price points. Old spice tins, talcum powder tins, tobacco tins, even the occasional New Era tin, a precursor of Frito-Lay. “I tend to look for the unusual now,” she said, “and the older, the better.”
Word of Murray’s growing army of whimsical figures got out. Custom orders started coming in. In the past few years, she estimated she’s made 300 or so one-of-a-kind creations.
No detail is too small.
In keeping with the use of found and organic products, Murray buys unprocessed wool by the bag at Local Roots Market and Cafe. It shows up more often this time of year as beards on Santas. Collars are made of mink and hair often is plucked from her collection of antique bristle brushes. Even old wishbones are not beyond the realm of possibility, said Murray. “It’s hard for me to throw away a wishbone, but I don’t want to break it.”
She fashioned a bulldog for a University of Georgia charity auction and created Buzz the Hornet for Georgia Tech. One customer wanted a Russell Crowe-a-la-Gladiator replica, and got it.
“Some pieces go easy,” Murray said. “Others drive my nuts.” She frets about the custom work but is happy now that she has some time to create characters that grace her own special shelf at Haiss’s shop.
There’s a figurine for every holiday. A sock monkey has a barrel torso that was once a bank.
The tools of Murray’s trade vary: an ice pick to poke holes in the tin, oils and acrylics to paint faces, sealants to make sure every detail stays.
Murray has traded her office for a workspace that overlooks a pond at her home. The best moments, she said, are when she finishes a piece and “I chuckle out loud” at it.
Murray’s retirement and second career as an artist couldn’t have come at better time for Haiss, whose other plans include shifting her month off from the traditional July to September. For Murray, schedules are secondary. “I take my clay on vacation and do it in hotel rooms,” she said. “As long as I have some water, I’m good.”

Texto completo:   Hold onto your hats. You might not be able to handle the cuteness when you see one of Dory Smith Graham's adorable Little Trapper Hats for kids.
Graham, who lives in Bar Harbor, produces all kinds of winter gear through her business Worthy Goods, which is "dedicated to making gear steeped in Maine style."
She designed the Little Trapper Hats - ideal for keeping little ears warm - in 2008, after she had her son and started making clothes for him.
The hats are made with upcycled wool blankets or shirts on the outside. They're lined in organic cotton sherpa (a synthetic fabric that looks like sheep's wool) that is made in the United States and is GOTS-certified (Global Organic Textile Standard).
Leather strips on each side of the hat - gleaned from a leather worker's scraps - can be tied under the chin to hold the earflaps down, or tied on top of the head to keep the ears uncovered.
Either way, your child will go outside looking like a miniature mountain man.
"I just wanted it to be a 1950s-style, little boy's sporting hat," Graham said. "I'm from northern Maine, so there's a lot of hand-me-downs that get passed through generations, and I just love that look."
Graham has made custom trapper hats for grown-ups, but mostly she focuses on children's sizes, starting at newborn to six months and going up to sizes that fit a 7- or 8-year-old. "The tinier they are, the cute factor increases so many times," she said, laughing.
Each hat comes with Graham's custom "Made in Maine" label that looks like a Maine lobster license plate.
The hats cost $38 and can be purchased through Graham's website, worthy-goods.com; at the SevenArts co-op gallery at 192 Main St. in Ellsworth; or at the Center for Maine Craft in West Gardiner.

Texto completo:   Feast of the Sustainable Seven Fishes: A take off from the tradition in (CBR's husband) Andy's Eastern European family's tradition of fish on Christmas Eve. His immediate family is Protestant but that whole side is Catholic so that is where it comes from. So this piece will talk about the best sustainable seafood options for the holiday. Recipe: Roasted Oysters with Casco BayTruffle Butter
Broiled Oysters with Truffle Butter
For a recent French-themed pop-up dinner at Enoteca Athena, my friend Ali Waks-Adams, executive chef at The Brunswick Inn, and I adapted this recipe from one we found on Food52.com to accommodate Maine oysters and Casco Bay Butter Company's truffle butter. Select large oysters with deeply cupped shells to hold all the flavor of the liquor and the butter. These mostly can be prepared early in the day and refrigerated, then broiled just before serving. We lined each plate with a slice of baguette to steady the presentation and not let any of the wonderful juices go to waste.
Makes 12 oysters
12 large Maine oysters, rinsed
4 tablespoons truffle butter
3/4 cup panko bread crumbs
2 tablespoons minced Italian parsley
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
Sea salt
Preheat broiler to high. Arrange oysters, flat side up, on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil the oysters until they pop open, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pan from oven. Cool for 10 minutes.
Pull off the flat top shell off each oyster, loosen the oyster meat inside each bottom shell and gently drain the oyster liquor from each into a measuring cup. Pour any liquor that has spilled onto the pan into the measuring cup as well.
Arrange the oysters in a baking dish just large enough to hold them all.
Melt truffle butter. Whisk half of the butter into the measuring cup with the oyster liquor. Divide this liquid among the oysters, taking care that it does not overflow. Combine the remaining butter with bread crumbs, parsley and lemon zest.
Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of crumb mixture over each oyster. Top with a pinch of sea salt.
Place the baking dish under the broiler until the bread crumbs are golden brown and the oysters warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve hot.

Texto completo:   * LABOR
New state OT pay rules will take effect Jan. 7
State officials are giving employers in Maine until Jan. 7 to comply with a new overtime pay standard resulting from the state's increased minimum wage. The state standard is different from the new federal standard, which has been delayed by a court challenge. Maine's overtime pay requirement, set by state statute, says qualifying salaried employees cannot be exempted from receiving overtime pay unless their annual salary exceeds 3,000 times the state's hourly minimum wage. At the current minimum wage of $7.50 an hour, that threshold is $22,500 a year. However, Maine voters approved a statewide minimum wage increase on Nov. 8 that takes effect Jan. 1, when the minimum wage will be increased to $9 an hour. As a result, the annual salary threshold for overtime pay exemption in Maine will increase to $27,000 in January. That means certain salaried employees must be paid 1.5 times their regular pay for work over 40 hours a week if their salaries fall below the new threshold.
November unemployment rate unchanged at 4%
Maine's unemployment rate held steady at 4 percent in November. The state Department of Labor said the figure was the same for October, and down slightly from 4.1 percent a year ago. The number of unemployed people was also little changed over the course of the year at 27,500. The nationwide unemployment rate for the month was 4.6 percent, down from 4.9 percent in October and 5 percent a year ago. New England's unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, with a low of 2.7 percent in New Hampshire and a high of 5.3 percent in Rhode Island.
* ENERGY
Largest battery in region installed at Wyman Station
New England's largest battery project - the size of eight shipping containers - is set to begin operating in the next week or so at the Wyman Station power plant in Yarmouth. The project is part of an industry-wide trend to use battery storage to moderate power supply to the grid, which could lower electricity prices for consumers. It also is intended to backstop the intermittent power generated by wind and solar, which are affected by the weather. NextEra Energy Resources, Wyman Station's lead owner and operator, has installed 1,300 lithium ion modules - a giant lithium battery - in a warehouse at the oil-fired power plant. The project is designed to offer the region's grid operator, ISO-New England, a more cost-effective way to help regulate daily changes in supply and demand than calling on large gas-fired power plants. The battery project at Wyman Station is rated at 16.2 megawatts. By comparison, ISO-New England needs between 30 and 100 megawatts of variable power on a typical day to regulate the system.
New Jersey firm buys fifth Maine hydro plant
A power company in Morristown, New Jersey, has purchased a hydroelectric facility in Lisbon Falls that operates at the site of a former woolen mill. Eagle Creek Renewable Energy LLC acquired Brown Bear II Hydro Holdings LLC, which owns the Worumbo hydroelectric facility, on Nov. 29, according to a news release from Eagle Creek. The purchase price was not disclosed. Worumbo is a 19-megawatt hydroelectric generator on the Androscoggin River that produces enough electricity to power about 12,500 homes. The facility will continue to supply electricity under a power purchase agreement. In January, Eagle Creek purchased four hydroelectric generators connected to the Verso paper mill in Jay for $62 million. Those facilities are also on the Androscoggin River.
* REAL ESTATE & DEVELOPMENT
Portland delays action on short-term rentals
Portland City Council's Housing Committee has delayed recommending regulations on short-term rentals to the full council until it has clarified issues raised at its meeting Wednesday. Committee Chairwoman Jill Duson said at the beginning of the meeting that she would consider sending the council three options for regulating rentals such as those provided through the Airbnb website. But after two hours of deliberation and testimony from the public, Duson conceded the committee had more work to do. The city has been working on rules for short-term rentals since summer. Some housing advocates are concerned the rentals take full-time housing off the market, drive up prices and change neighborhood character. Short-term hosts argue their properties give visitors extra lodging options and bring tourism dollars into the city. Another committee member said the body would need at least one more meeting, and maybe two, before being able to make a clear recommendation to the council.
Architects share plans for Congress Square Park
A conceptual design for Congress Square Park and the surrounding intersection showed sloping levels, a performance stage facing traffic and a plaza in front of the Portland Museum of Art that would eliminate the cut-through from High Street to Free Street. Designers from Philadephia-based WRT unveiled the plans at a public forum Thursday at the Westin hotel, next to the park at the corner of High and Congress streets. Nearly 100 people attended the meeting, many of whom asked questions and offered feedback the designers said they would take into consideration as they solidify the plan. The effort to remake Congress Square grew out of a controversial move by the City Council in 2013 to sell a portion of Congress Square Park to an out-of-state developer looking to building an event center. The proposed sale prompted residents to organize, protest and ultimately overturn the sale through a citywide referendum that also added protections to all of the city's parks. WRT designers did not have estimates of the cost or time frame for implementing the plan, which would rely on fundraising.
* INSURANCE
Workers' compensation innovator to retire
John Leonard plans to retire after nearly a quarter century of leading The MEMIC Group, the company credited with helping reduce Maine worker injuries by the thousands while saving the state's employers millions of dollars. The company has been instrumental in significantly reducing workplace injuries and their associated costs in Maine. MEMIC was established in 1992 by state statute as the guaranteed market for workers' compensation to stabilize a dysfunctional workers' comp market that threatened to paralyze the state's economy. Under Leonard's leadership, by 1998 the company had managed to reduce lost-time injuries of Maine workers by 30 percent and lowered workers' comp insurance costs by 40 percent. MEMIC has become a model for other states, with its focus on requiring employers to meet strict safety standards to reduce costs and keep worker injuries at a minimum. Leonard plans to step down in September 2017.
* HEALTH CARE
MaineHealth consolidation plan prompts pushback
MaineHealth's tentative plan to consolidate and streamline operations within the state's largest health care network is running into opposition from health care organizations operating under its umbrella. The proposal would merge a dozen affiliated health systems into one nonprofit MaineHealth entity. MaineHealth officials say it would be a fairer and more efficient way to manage the health systems, but critics liken it to a power grab. The proposal - to be rolled out over the next several months - would unify 12 separate nonprofits into one 18,000-employee nonprofit organization, with one board that would make final decisions for the entire system. Objections have been raised from the boards of several organizations and practice groups. MaineHealth is the parent company of Maine Medical Center and 11 other hospitals and health care networks, including Franklin Community Health Network, Western Maine Health, Maine Behavioral Healthcare, Memorial Hospital in New Hampshire and Southern Maine Health Care.
* RETAIL
Eventide Oyster Co. expanding to Boston
After garnering national attention and accolades for its oysters and its brown butter lobster roll, Portland's Eventide Oyster Co. is planning to expand to Boston. The new Eventide is planned for a space on Boylston Street in Boston's Fenway neighborhood. Mike Wiley, one of the three owners, said Monday that long lines at the Middle Street restaurant are the main reason for expanding. The owners picked Boston, he said, partly because they have friends there and because of Boston's larger, more steady customer base. A statement from the firm said Wiley and his co-owners, known as Big Tree Hospitality, are "actively involved in securing space for a new restaurant concept at 1321 Boylston Street in Boston."

November 21, 1940 - December 14, 2016
S. Robert Branson, Jr., formerly of Windham and Scarborough, Maine, died peacefully at his home in Venice, Florida on December 14.
He was born in Portland, Maine, November 21, 1940, the son of Sidney R. Branson, M.D., and Nora (Baker) Branson.
Bob attended Deering High School and graduated from Bowdoin College in 1963. A few years later, he married Beth Simonds, his friend and sweetheart since the 5th grade. They moved to Connecticut where he began his work life as a teacher, coach, and administrator at Suffield Academy for more than 12 years. He received his Master's degree in Education from New York University.
Bob returned to the Portland area where he made a career in the Home Oxygen/Home I.V. Therapy business during the 1980s and 1990s. He was employed by RTI/Homedco, and later started New England Life Care-Maine in 1987. In 1992, he established Branson Associates, Inc., a healthcare consulting organization.
Bob and Beth retired in 2005 and moved to their current home in Venice, Florida. They volunteered at Meals on Wheels, and Bob did trail work at the Carlton Reserve. They were members of Good Shepherd Episcopal Church in Venice.
Bob was a lifelong outdoor enthusiast; he enjoyed running, hiking, canoeing, kayaking, cycling, camping, and fishing.
Bob was predeceased by his parents. He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Beth (Simonds) Branson, his sister, Sandra Williams (Ed) of Cape Elizabeth, his brother, John B. Branson of Port Alsworth, Alaska, his children, Jane Smack (Mike) of Norfolk, Virginia, John H. Branson (Donna) of Cape Elizabeth, and granddaughters, Hillary Bontempi and Lydia Branson.
Services will be held on Thursday, December 29 at 2 p.m. at Good Shepherd Episcopal Church, 1115 Center Road, Venice. Bob will be buried in Maine; there will be a graveside service this summer (date to be determined) at Smith Cemetery, Route 202, Windham Center, Maine, followed by a celebration of life at the family's cottage at Pine Point.

Texto completo:   SMITHFIELD, Rhode Island -- The University of Maine women's basketball team had made 25 3-point field goals in its last three games before Saturday afternoon's non-conference game at Bryant University.
It turns out it was just the beginning.
Coach Richard Barron's Black Bears came out firing from long distance and shot 54.8 percent from beyond the arc for the game to score a 77-52 win over the Bulldogs at the Chace Athletic Center.
The win was the third straight for UMaine, now 6-5 and headed to Florida for the University of Miami Holiday Tournament. The Black Bears play East Tennessee State at 3 p.m. Monday and either Miami or Coppin State on Tuesday.
The loss was the sixth in the last seven games for Bryant (4-6).
Senior guard Sigi Koizar led Maine to its highest scoring output of the season with 20 points, including the 1,400th of her career. Koizar made eight of her 14 field-goal attempts and also contributed five rebounds. Tanesha Sutton posted 12 points, six assists and six rebounds and Blanca Millan scored 11 points, including three 3-pointers.
Julie Brosseau added eight points for the Black Bears, including two 3-pointers, and UMaine also got a late boost from 6-foot-2 freshman Tihana Stojsavljevic, who scored seven points in eight minutes to help the Black Bears hold off a second-half Bryant comeback.
Sydney Holloway led Bryant of the Northeast Conference with 16 points while Alex Klein had 11 points and five rebounds.
UMaine, which connected on 12 of 22 3-point tries for the game, made nine of its 16 first-half attempts from beyond the arc to build a 45-25 lead -- nailing six 3-pointers in the first quarter alone en route to a 28-16 advantage.
"It was a great first half for us," Barron told Don Shields of Learfield. "We shot the ball very well, especially in that first quarter. Twenty-eight points is a lot of points in a quarter, and I'm very happy with that."
The Black Bears also induced 15 Bryant turnovers before the break and outscored the Bulldogs 25-0 on points off turnovers during the game's first 20 minutes.
Bryant held a 14-10 lead after a 3-pointer by Kierra Palmer with 4:44 left in the first quarter before UMaine used its long-range shooting to score 15 unanswered points and take the lead for good.
Koizar started the run with a layup before Sutton hit a 3-pointer to give Maine a 15-14 edge. Sutton then made a layup and Laia Sole converted a jumper before Millan and Naira Caceres each scored from beyond the arc to extend the Black Bears' cushion to 25-14 with 1:06 left in the opening period.
Haley Connors finally answered for Bryant with a layup, but Brosseau hit UMaine's sixth 3-pointer in the game's first 10 minutes to give the Black Bears their 12-point lead at the end of the period.
The UMaine run grew to 20-2 as Koizar went inside to score 19 seconds into the second period.
A Holloway layup kept Bryant within 32-22 midway through the second quarter before UMaine scored 13 unanswered points to take a 45-22 lead on a layup by Millan with 1:25 left in the half.
UMaine couldn't maintain its 3-point volume after intermission, and Bryant gradually climbed back into the contest -- pulling within 58-48 on a 3-pointer by Stephanie Lesko with 7:56 left in the game.
"I was not happy with our energy coming out after halftime," said Barron. "We knew that this was a team that was going to play with pride and they came out and cut it to 10. They were on a big run and outscored us by seven in the third quarter. I was disappointed with our intensity and I thought they brought it, Bryant did."
But UMaine altered its lineup and regained control with 14 unanswered points.
"We made some substitutions and I thought Tihana had obviously her best game," said Barron. "Even though she brought four fouls along with it she brought some intensity we were looking for. That inspired us and we ended up having a big fourth quarter.
"The kid's going to be special," added Barron of Stojsavljevic. "She's got a lot to learn and a lot to develop and we're going to be patient with her as she does it, but she really has a lot of upside."

Texto completo:   VASSALBORO -- The Maine Criminal Justice Academy graduated 61 new police officers on Dec. 16 from the 18-week Basic Law Enforcement Training Program (BLETP). Among the many topics the officers studied were crime scene processing, emergency vehicle operation, firearms proficiency, traffic and criminal law, domestic violence and sexual assault.
Of those 61 officers, five were Maine game wardens who will now be entering their next phase of training. A 12-week Advanced Game Warden Academy, also based out of Vassalboro, will begin in late January where skills more specific to game warden work will be taught. In addition, they will also participate in an intensive Warden Training Officer program involving field work, team building and problem solving.
Graduating for the Maine Warden Service are Game Wardens Camden Akins, 23, from Winslow, Kayle Hamilton, 26, from Buxton, Megan Miller, 22, from Pittsfield, Lauren Roddy, 21, from Belgrade, and Taylor Valente, 24, from New Gloucester. Game Warden Kyle Franklin, 24, from Durham will be entering the academy in August.
Maine's newest game wardens have been assigned their patrol areas. Akins has been assigned to the Chamberlain Lake district, Hamilton is headed for the Clayton Lake district, Miller will be going to the Mars Hill district, Roddy will be covering the Jackman district, Valente has been assigned the Rockwood district and Franklin will be going to Escort Station next year.
The class commencement address was given by Maine Attorney General Janet Mills. Maine's Chief Game Warden, Col. Joel Wilkinson said, We are very proud of our five game wardens and their successful completion of the 18-week BLETP. Their actions and performance through the training process demonstrate the success of our rigorous screening and hiring process of hiring the very best."

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- A weekend storm that swept across Maine Saturday into Sunday brought with it wildly fluctuating weather after a deep freeze Friday that made for some hazardous driving.
Between 3 and 6 inches of snow fell across the state Saturday, and as temperatures rose Saturday night into Sunday morning, the snow changed into freezing rain and then in some locations, plain old rain.
Bangor was one of the places that saw a rapid warm-up on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service's Caribou office, which tweeted Sunday morning that the temperature there had jumped from 33 degrees to 42 degrees within an hour.
The weather service later tweeted that as of 10:30 a.m., Bangor, which had hit 46 degrees, was warmer than Houston, Texas, where the temperature was 39 degrees.
The entire state was under a hazardous weather outlook effective Sunday afternoon and evening, when temperatures were expected to drop below freezing as a cold front swept across the state, followed by a much colder mass of air later in the evening, according to the National Weather Service.
Whether it was snow or freezing rain, driving conditions were difficult, resulting in dozens of crashes throughout the state.
Although cars and trucks crashed and slid off the roadway around the state, there were no reports of deaths from storm-related motor vehicle accidents in Maine as of Sunday afternoon.
In one of the more unusual crashes, a drunken driver struck two police cruisers from the Yarmouth and Freeport police departments on Interstate 295 in Yarmouth. No one was injured in that crash.
Dangerous travel conditions also resulted in more than 170 business and government closings and event cancellations, most of which were worship services and across southern Maine.
The weather also was to blame for outages Sunday morning that left a few thousand Emera Maine and Central Maine Power Co. customers without power.
Both utilities made significant headway in their efforts to restore power by midafternoon.
Emera Maine, which had 2,150 customers out as of 10:30 a.m., has restored power to all but 90 customers by 3 p.m.
By 6 p.m., however, subsequent rounds of outages had pushed the total back up to nearly 1,700. The bulk of the affected customers, nearly 1,200, were in Blue Hill, Burlington, Brooksville, Penobscot, Sedgwick and Winter Harbor.
CMP, which had about 400 customers out Sunday morning, restored service to all but 280 accounts as of 3 p.m. As of 6 p.m., the total had not budged much. It stood at 254.
Looking ahead, the weather service's Caribou office said that bitterly cold conditions and gusty winds Sunday night into Monday morning will freeze standing water from Sunday's rain or snowmelt, creating patches of black ice. Motorists are warned to use caution and be alert for rapidly changing road conditions.
In addition, northwest winds with gusts of up to 30 to 40 mph were possible, especially across the higher terrain of the central highlands and the Down East region. Strong winds combined with any ice that accumulated on trees and power lines during the day could result in power outages.
Forecasters said that the winds were expected to result in bitterly cold wind chills of minus 10 to minus 20 degrees across the northern and western parts of the state.

Texto completo:   The decision by voters in California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine to legalize marijuana has been overshadowed by the presidential contest results. But now that you've been reminded of that fact, if you go to a college in one of those states and are tempted to partake in the newly legal substance, you might need to temper your expectations before you begin investing in more Cheez-Its and Bob Marley posters for the dorm room.
Why? Just because marijuana is legal statewide does not mean it's OK to use on campus.
Take University of Massachusetts-Amherst, for example. Ed Blaguszewski, a spokesman for the university, told USA TODAY College that marijuana is still not permitted on campus, as it remains illegal on the federal level and is still a violation of the student code, much like alcohol.
University of Maine dean of students Robert Dana said that while clarifications would be made to students, the university policy on marijuana would be unlikely to change in light of legalization in Maine.
"We have a fairly firm belief that the immoderate use of any psychoactive substance is corrosive to the learning environment, so that would certainly be the case here," Dana told USA TODAY College.
The University of Maine remains a smoke-free campus and bans alcohol and marijuana.
Why does federal law supercede state law on campus? Because most universities and colleges maintain federal funding -- often times more funding than the state or private sources can offer. Policies relaxing the prohibition of marijuana on campus could endanger that funding.
Betty Aldworth, executive director of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, said her organization will continue its campaign to equalize alcohol and marijuana offenses on campuses, as well as push for policy change in regards to medical marijuana restrictions on campus.
"It's terrifically unfortunate that even in these places where marijuana has been reformed, on college campuses students are still being treated like criminals," she said. "What colleges ought to be doing is providing the lowest level of sanctions possible, and support services when needed. Perhaps that means taking a class or performing a few hours of community service when students are caught using marijuana on campus. That would meet the federal guidelines."

Texto completo:   The decision by voters in California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine to legalize marijuana has been overshadowed by the presidential contest results. But now that you've been reminded of that fact, if you go to a college in one of those states and are tempted to partake in the newly legal substance, you might need to temper your expectations before you begin investing in more Cheez-Its and Bob Marley posters for the dorm room.
Why? Just because marijuana is legal statewide does not mean it's OK to use on campus.
Take University of Massachusetts-Amherst, for example. Ed Blaguszewski, a spokesman for the university, told USA TODAY College that marijuana is still not permitted on campus, as it remains illegal on the federal level and is still a violation of the student code, much like alcohol.
University of Maine dean of students Robert Dana said that while clarifications would be made to students, the university policy on marijuana would be unlikely to change in light of legalization in Maine.
"We have a fairly firm belief that the immoderate use of any psychoactive substance is corrosive to the learning environment, so that would certainly be the case here," Dana told USA TODAY College.
The University of Maine remains a smoke-free campus and bans alcohol and marijuana.
Why does federal law supercede state law on campus? Because most universities and colleges maintain federal funding -- often times more funding than the state or private sources can offer. Policies relaxing the prohibition of marijuana on campus could endanger that funding.
Betty Aldworth, executive director of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, said her organization will continue its campaign to equalize alcohol and marijuana offenses on campuses, as well as push for policy change in regards to medical marijuana restrictions on campus.
"It's terrifically unfortunate that even in these places where marijuana has been reformed, on college campuses students are still being treated like criminals," she said. "What colleges ought to be doing is providing the lowest level of sanctions possible, and support services when needed. Perhaps that means taking a class or performing a few hours of community service when students are caught using marijuana on campus. That would meet the federal guidelines."

Texto completo:   DELTA TWP. - Auto-Owners Insurance would expand its footprint to four more states if an affiliation agreement is approved with Concord General Mutual Insurance next year.
The Delta Township-based company announced the proposed affiliation with Concord, which operates in New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts, on Wednesday.
The affiliation would allows Auto-Owners to sell insurance products through the 500 independent agents in Concord's network, said Bill Woodbury, senior vice president of Auto-Owners.
"This is big news for us," Woodbury said. "We've been looking for opportunities to grow."
Auto-Owners acquired a North Carolina-based Atlantic Casualty Insurance Co. last summer.
The affiliation agreement with Concord would allow Auto-Owners to assume control of the New Hampshire company's board of directors, Woodbury said.
Auto Owners also would add jobs at its Delta Township headquarters in the legal, information technology and human resources departments.
Woodbury said its too early to tell how many jobs would be created by the affiliation agreement.
Boards of both companies have approved the deal, but it still needs regulatory approval and a vote by Concord policy holders.
The process is expected to last into the second quarter of 2017.
Auto-Owners was founded in 1916. It employs more than 2,000 locally and 4,700 nationally.

Texto completo:   Burlington slid into Saturday morning with 3 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service at Burlington International Airport. But the powder was not expected to last.
"We are in a lull now with more precipitation -- cold and freezing rain -- on the way," Lead Meteorologist John Goff said on Saturday afternoon. "The wintry mix will develop later this evening."
Goff doesn't expect the weather to cause many problems in the Champlain Valley. However, east of the Green Mountains and in the islands he reports there are winter weather advisories until 7 a.m. today.
Sleet will mix with snow and freezing rain through early this morning creating hazardous travel conditions in eastern Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire, according to the National Weather Service
Williston State Police dispatch reported that all cars were out on the roads at 4 p.m. Saturday dealing with minor issues related to sloppy weather on a big shopping weekend.
Police urge drivers to slow down and allow extra time to get to destinations.
Today's weather may reach a high of 40 degrees, but temperatures will plunge tonight into Monday, according to data collected by the National Weather Service. But with no precipitation predicted, commuters in the Champlain Valley can expect a trouble-free ride.
The season's first major storm dumped snow throughout southern New England and caused slippery road conditions.
Snow fell for hours throughout the region on Saturday morning. The National Weather Service reports snowfall ranged from just under 3 feet in southeastern Massachusetts to higher than 7 feet in parts of Connecticut and western Massachusetts. Temperatures warmed and snow turned to rain in some places Saturday after a couple of days of bitter cold in the Northeast.

Who's jockeying for a head start in the race to become Maine's next governor?

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- The behind-the-scenes campaign for the Blaine House in 2018 has begun, with Republicans waiting to see if federal officeholders jump in, Democrats looking early at a potential insider-outsider race and independents mulling bids.
It's a race that could reshape Maine, with the term-limited Paul LePage leaving the governorship in 2019, eight years after taking office in a historic year for Republicans that set Democrats back after 40 years in which they largely controlled state government.
The LePage era has provided a deep Republican bench in Maine, but it's U.S. Sen. Susan Collins and U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin looming large over an otherwise less-known but capable field as perhaps the only people who could drive potential candidates in both parties from the race.
Democrats are a party in flux, with longtime lawmakers faring badly in Maine elections back to 2010. Attorney Adam Cote and Lee Auto Malls chairman Adam Lee could mount outsider campaigns against officeholders past and present, including Attorney General Janet Mills.
Plus, Maine's independent streak and a 2016 referendum passing ranked-choice voting could leave room for unenrolled candidates, with two-time gubernatorial hopeful Eliot Cutler cracking the door open to a run after vowing last year to not run again.
To examine the field, the Bangor Daily News contacted 24 people who have been named publicly as potential hopefuls or were named by sources, with 21 responding. Eight said they're considering bids, and eight gave neutral statements.
Republicans
Collins and Poliquin hold sway over the rest of their party for a few good reasons.
-- She polls as Maine's most popular politician, and he won re-election this year in the 2nd U.S. House District after becoming the first Republican to win that seat in 20 years.
-- They could win what they've lost before. Collins dropped the 1994 gubernatorial race to independent Angus King, while Poliquin finished sixth out of seven in the 2010 Republican primary.
-- If they leave their seats, it would set off a scramble for other accessible offices.
But both are being coy. In a statement, Collins spokeswoman Annie Clark noted that "many Mainers" have encouraged the senator to run, but "it is too early to be speculating about an election that is two years away." Poliquin strategist Brent Littlefield said he had "nothing to add" when asked if Poliquin is considering a bid.
Four other Republicans indicated openness to a run: Maine Republican Party Chairman Rick Bennett of Oxford; Maine Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason, R-Lisbon Falls; lobbyist and former Maine House Minority Leader Josh Tardy of Newport; and state Sen. Roger Katz of Augusta.
Tardy said he's in the "early stages" of considering a run and talking to people about supporting his potential candidacy, looking to make a decision by summer.
"I'd like to know what Sen. Collins or Congressman Poliquin are going to do, and that would certainly inform my decision," he said.
Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew of South China is also rumored to be considering a run. She was neutral on a run in an email, citing "critical issues" at the department that "deserve my full attention."
Ruling out a run was Cianbro President and CEO Peter Vigue of Pittsfield. Senate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, has said he won't run.
Democrats
One Democratic source said he'd put money on just two candidates in his party running at this point: Cote and Mills, with Lee perhaps next most likely. Cote and Lee would be the types of candidates that Democrats haven't traditionally run.
In 2010 and 2014, LePage beat two longtime legislators, Libby Mitchell and Mike Michaud. Poliquin twice beat Democrat Emily Cain, who boasted a 10-year legislative record, and Democrat Hillary Clinton lost Maine's 2nd District to the political outsider Trump this year.
Cote, an attorney from Sanford, finished second in the 2008 primary in Maine's 1st District won by Chellie Pingree, who went on to win the general election and still holds the seat. But he impressed, raising more than $650,000 and beating former legislators Michael Brennan and Ethan Strimling, who have since been mayor of Portland.
In a lengthy statement, Cote said he was considering a run, noting Maine's rural economic struggles and high rates of child poverty, calling for "smart, progressive economic growth in every part of Maine."
Lee of Cumberland has been active in Maine politics as a donor to Democratic candidates and causes and sits on several boards, including that of the Maine Conservation Voters. He said he's continuing to consider a run and will decide "in the next month or so."
Mills of Farmington didn't respond to a request for comment. Other past or current officeholders who said they're considering a run include Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap of Old Town and former Senate President Justin Alfond of Portland.
Pingree and former House Speaker Mark Eves of North Berwick gave neutral statements on the question. So did Lucas St. Clair of Portland, president of Elliotsville Plantation Inc., son of millionaire conservationist Roxanne Quimby and driving force behind the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument declared this year by President Barack Obama.
"This is the best state that I have ever lived in. I am so thankful that I am able to live here and raise my family here. And regardless of what is next for me professionally, I want to be part of the solutions," St. Clair said.
Ruling out runs were former House Speaker Hannah Pingree of North Haven, the congresswoman's daughter, and Yellow Light Breen of Holden, CEO of the Maine Development Foundation. Former state Rep. Adam Goode of Bangor said he hasn't considered running. Senate Minority Leader Troy Jackson of Allagash has said he won't run.
Independents
Cutler of Cape Elizabeth is the biggest name in the independent field, and he likely would have been governor had ranked-choice voting -- which he supported -- been the law in 2010.
That citizen-initiated law has constitutional questions, so it's unclear what role it will play in 2018. He got just 8 percent of votes in 2014 and told the Portland Press Herald in 2015 that he was "taking a vow of abstinence" from running again.
Now the CEO of the University of Maine System's Professional and Graduate Center Initiative, Cutler said in an email that the vow "certainly applies for so long" as he works there, "which would mean that since I remain in the System's employ, I really shouldn't comment any further."
"Nice to know, though, that at least in your eyes I still have 'potential!'" Cutler put in parentheses.
Moody's Collision Centers founder Shawn Moody of Gorham finished fourth in the 2010 race, mounting a late bid that garnered just 5 percent of votes, but lots of goodwill for Moody's genial disposition. LePage has appointed him to Maine's university and community college boards. Moody said it's "too early" to say whether he'll run again.
And another prominent independent, former state Sen. Dick Woodbury of Yarmouth, said he has no plans to run now and it's not likely that he will.

Texto completo:   CONCORD, N.H. * Chris Connors never played by the rules, and his family was determined that his obituary wouldn't either.
From the first line about him dying of whiskey and stubbornness, the obit for the 67-year-old Maine resident published in the seacoastonline.com this week went on to detail a man who "lived 1,000 years in the 67 calendar years we had with him because he attacked life."
Connors was stabbed saving a woman during a mugging in New York, got stranded in a life raft for 40 hours off Panama and reached base camp at Mount Everest at the age of 64. A Golden Gloves boxer from Quincy, Mass., who went on to make a career on Wall Street, Connors was known for taking a swim in the ocean in January, occasionally cross dressing and leading a rousing night on the town with friends.
His passion for life was on display until the end, with one of his daughters recalling how he boxed with a bikini-clad hospice nurse and, 15 hours before he died, danced the Irish jig. His last words were curses.
"The way he died is just like he lived: He wrote his own rules, he fought authority and he paved his own way," according to the obituary which has gone viral. "And if you said he couldn't do it, he would make sure he could."
Connors, who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and pancreatic cancer, died Dec. 9 at his home surrounded by his family. He had a wife and three children.
"He was a rare combination of someone who had a love of life and a firm understanding of what was important the simplicity of living a life with those you love," according to the obituary. "Although he threw some of the most memorable parties during the greater half of a century, he would trade it all for a night in front of the fire with his family in Maine."
Connors' daughter, Caitlin, wrote the obit with a cousin soon after her father died. Sitting around a fire with family members drinking, crying and celebrating, everyone just started sharing stories, she said, and the obit emerged.
Since it was published, Caitlin Connors said the obit has gone viral with people calling it inspirational, refreshing and praising its celebratory tone. Some even wonder if all his stories were true they are, she says and others "wishing they could have met him."
"I think he would be so happy," his daughter said, adding that her father had wanted the obit to be funny. She said the message she hoped to convey is "not to take life to seriously" and pull more out of life "than what life gives you."
She said her father loved being a jokester and, "Now, we got to share all these stories and people are inspired by it."
Caitlin Connors said readers also had responded to the obit by donating $8,000 to the Chris Connors Fund, a boating and water safety program for York, Maine, and its surrounding community. The goal of the program is to save lives by promoting and teaching safer boating and water habits for children.

Legal pot not so at college

Texto completo:   The decision by voters in California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine to legalize marijuana has been overshadowed by the presidential contest results. But now that you've been reminded of that fact, if you go to a college in one of those states and are tempted to partake in the newly legal substance, you might need to temper your expectations before you begin investing in more Cheez-Its and
Bob Marley posters for the
dorm room.
Why? Just because marijuana is legal statewide
does not mean it's OK to
use on campus.
Take University of Massachusetts-Amherst, for example. Ed Blaguszewski, a spokesman for the university, told USA TODAY College that marijuana is still not permitted on campus, as it remains illegal on the federal level and is still a violation of the student code, much like alcohol.
University of Maine dean of students Robert Dana said that while clarifications would be made to students, the university policy on marijuana would be unlikely to change in light of legalization in Maine.
"We have a fairly firm belief that the immoderate use of any psychoactive substance is corrosive to the learning environment, so that would certainly be the case here," Dana told USA TODAY College.
The University of Maine remains a smoke-free campus and bans alcohol and marijuana.
Why does federal law super-cede state law on campus? Because most universities and colleges maintain federal funding -- often times more funding than the state or private sources can offer. Policies relaxing the prohibition of marijuana on campus could endanger that funding.
Betty Aldworth, executive director of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, said her organization will continue its campaign to equalize alcohol and marijuana offenses on campuses, as well as push for policy change in regards to medical marijuana restrictions on campus.
"It's terrifically unfortunate that even in these places where marijuana has been reformed, on college campuses students are still being treated like criminals," she said. "What colleges ought to be doing is providing the lowest level of sanctions possible, and support services when needed. Perhaps that means taking a class or performing a few hours of community service when students are caught using marijuana on campus. That would meet the federal guidelines."

Texto completo:   MILLINOCKET, Maine - The coffee shop's jaunty sign beckoned, promising warmth and hot coffee, but on a recent Saturday morning, when we peered closely at the door, we realized that it was closed. The Appalachian Trail Cafe looked great, but it was only open in the summer, when the hikers come to Millinocket to climb Mount Katahdin or to hike the Appalachian Trail.
There are a lot of empty storefronts on Main Street. Great Northern Paper closed its plant in 2008. Many people lost their jobs. Others lost their retirement benefits. Many left. Some turn off their heat at night and bundle up when they go to bed. And it's cold in northern Maine.
It was minus-11 with the wind chill when we set out - some friends, me and some 550 other runners from all over the country - Dec. 10 in the most improbable of settings to run the second Millinocket Marathon and half-marathon. The 13.1-mile loop ran up what locals call the Golden Road, a dirt logging road, toward a majestic view of snow-peaked Katahdin, then down the other side back into town.
We ran the half. The marathoners, God bless them, had to do it twice.
Did I mention it was cold?
Michael Wardian, the four-time USA Track & Field ultramarathoner of the year from Virginia who won the Hartford Marathon in 2010, finished third in the marathon, with icicles clinging to his beard.
"The conditions were pretty rough," Wardian said. "But it was really about being there. It was fun to just be a part of it."
Gary Allen, a Maine race director and marathoner, organized the first race in 2015 after hearing about the plight of the town after its largest employer closed. After a month of planning, about 50 people showed up to run last December.
The race was free; the only stipulation was that runners come to town and spend money. Runner's World magazine picked up the story and quickly, this year's race sold out with 1,000 runners.
And then the magic began. The townspeople joined to welcome the runners. Fundraising pasta suppers were planned. A postrace dance at the Elks Club. A craft fair at the high school, where Wardian bought a hat with a pompom on top and some mittens, which he wore for the race, even though he has plenty of high-tech cold weather gear supplied by his sponsors.
"I never buy anything at expos normally," Wardian said. "But I bought two hand-knit hats and two pairs of gloves from the mitten lady. I wanted to try to do what I could to help support the economy."
Businesses in town got creative. For mile marker 17, there were tires stacked on top of each other, spray-painted white to look like snowmen. There was a working gear wheel for mile marker 20.
"Even though Gary [Allen] saw us as a struggling community, a poor suffering mill town, this town has so much spirit and pride," said Marsha Donahue, a race volunteer who owns North Light Gallery in town. "Given a little bit of energy, we said, 'We've got to give back to this group.' I think the sense of pride in the community came out."
And on race day, the people of Millinocket poured out of their homes, handing out cups of water that froze as the day went on, honking their horns, cheering and welcoming the runners as they crossed the finish line, where the finish banner was strung between two logging trucks.
"Oh, my word," said Tricia Cyr, whose Moose Drop In craft store on Main Street did a brisk business in race T-shirt sales over the weekend, "they got back their pride. Their self-worth. Dignity. The town has always had compassion. This was just an amazing thing.
"People don't go out in minus-12 wind chill just for fun. There were so many people out there, checking that the runners were OK. I know it was something to boost our economy, but it was so much more than that. It showed the town that people care."
According to a 2014 New York Times story, unemployment in Millinocket runs 10 percent to 21 percent and the town's population, once over 7,000 in the 1970s, was down to 4,466, and that population is aging.
"It's cold," said Cyr, who has lived in Millinocket for 16 years. "A lot of people don't have jobs. A lot of people are struggling to make ends meet. Praying they have money to put oil in their barrels so they don't freeze. Trying to buy basketball shoes for their kids.
"We do our damnedest to take care of our own the best we can. Sometimes people feel like they're alone."
Cyr's father-in-law worked in the mill. She grew up in a neighboring town and remembered what a big deal it was to go to Millinocket, where there was a downtown and a department store.
"It was a status thing here to be from Millinocket," she said.
Mainers are a resilient lot, although how to restart the economy in the town and the surrounding area was perplexing and frustrating. And then along came Allen, a longtime marathoner who has raised money for numerous charities and organizes the Mount Desert Island Marathon.
"Gary taught us to look outside the box," said Mike Madore, the town council chairman, a fourth-generation Millinocket resident who worked in the mill before he went to college. "No idea is a bad idea. I think that's what the town needed to see. People loved this idea and they were fascinated by it."
The question we runners were asked the most was: "Do you normally run in this weather?"
There were holiday decorations up, something the town hasn't done much of lately. The windows of an empty car dealership, highly visible to out-of-towners on the way to Main Street, were festively decorated instead of abandoned and empty.
"The marathon meant more to people of the town than the marathoners will ever understand," Cyr said.
"No, it's not going to solve the problems. It's not going to solve anything right now, but it's going to boost morale and how people feel about themselves. And that's where it's going to start solving problems.
More than 1,000 people have already signed up for the race next year. And yes, I'll be there.
It can't be any colder, right?

After all, the slender junior won his third straight Class C championship this fall with a 5-under-par 67. Considering that Thompson beat his closest challenger by eight strokes and is determined to keep improving, he's a good bet to become Maine's first four-time boys' golf champion.
"It just raises some expectations and the goals are going to be higher for myself, and I just have to work harder to try to reach those," Thompson said.
But when McCarthy thinks about Thompson's ability to perform in the clutch, he remembers a moment in Thompson's freshman season of basketball. "I was an assistant coach then," McCarthy said. "For a variety of reasons, our varsity team was without several starters. We were in a close game and we drew up a play and asked, 'who wants to shoot it?'"
All the older players deferred. Thompson, at the time 5-foot-3 and barely 90 pounds, piped up.
"Logan said, 'I'll shoot it,'" McCarthy said. "He got fouled before he could get the shot off, but it just shows what he's made of. He's just so calm in pressure situations."
Thompson played with extreme confidence this fall. He shot a 4-under 68 to lead Mattanawcook to its second straight Class C team title, then returned to the Arrowhead course at Natanis the following Saturday and went one stroke lower.
"I never try to get too high or too low. I just try to stay even-keeled," Thompson said. "It helps when things aren't going well that you can stay calm, and then when things are going right, you can build confidence."
For his championship efforts, as well as an undefeated regular-season in which he posted a nine-hole scoring average of 35.6, Thompson is the Maine Sunday Telegram Boys' Golfer of the Year.
Thompson was the only golfer to break par in either the team or individual state tournaments. He played the shorter of the 18-hole courses at Natanis while the Class A and B players were on the longer Tomahawk layout, but consider this: Playing against the best junior golfers in Maine this summer, including Class A champion Cole Anderson of Camden Hills, Thompson won the Maine Junior Championship by five strokes.
"He's methodical," said Mattanawcook Coach Ryan Libby. "He's like a machine. He hits it down the middle, knocks it on the green and usually has a birdie putt. If he makes it, he takes his birdie, and if not, he two-putts for par."
Thompson, who is now 5-9 and 125 pounds, is also hitting it longer - about 40 yards further off the tee than he did as a freshman - without losing any of his vaunted accuracy. That's allowed him to become strategically aggressive.
"Accuracy is a strength," Thompson said. "I've worked really hard to be able to hit the ball straight. A big thing is you have to stay out of trouble the best you can."
Thompson is still a three-sport athlete - he starts as an outfielder in baseball - but is intent on raising his profile this summer by playing in more junior tournaments, both in Maine and in American Junior Golf Association events.
"One of my goals for right now is to try to get to a Division I college and play on a golf team," Thompson said. "I've gotten a few letters from some colleges, no Division I colleges yet, and I'll have to work on my game."
Along the way, hopefully win his fourth individual championship.
"He's accomplished a lot, so I kept expecting a little bit of a letdown," Libby said, "but he's just relentless. I think next year he'll be just as focused and he'll want to end his career with people saying he's the best golfer to come through this part of the state."

Texto completo:   All-Telegram golf team (10 players) Girls golfer of the year: Bailey Plourde, Lincoln Acad. Boys golfer of the year: Logan Thompson, Mattanawcook Acad.
When Bailey Plourde is playing her best golf, she's among the top female players in Maine, regardless of age.
This year at the high school state championships, the 17-year-old senior from Newcastle and Lincoln Academy showed she's tough to beat even when struggling.
Plourde, the defending girls' champion, was pushing too many shots to the right through the first nine holes and found herself trailing longtime rival Erin Holmes of Greely.
"Through the first nine holes, there were not a lot of shots where I was happy with the result, but when making the turn I took a deep breath and broke down my swing," Plourde said. "On the back nine, I was able to adjust my swing a little and get more shots that I was happy with. If I hadn't been able to move past those bad shots on the front, I couldn't have adjusted."
When Holmes birdied the 18th hole, Plourde stood over her own birdie putt knowing she needed to make it to post match Holmes at 1-over 73 and earn a share of her third state championship.
"My approach wasn't the best, but I had the confidence I could make the putt," Plourde said.
She rolled it in to forge the tie, ending her high school career with consecutive titles to go with the crown she won as a freshman. It also capped a season in which she was undefeated as Lincoln's No. 1 player (9-0) and had a nine-hole stroke average of 37.4, and earned her a repeat selection as Maine Sunday Telegram Girls' Golfer of the Year.
"When she gets upset with herself or a particular shot, she grinds it out," said Lincoln Coach Todd Brackett. "She focuses that much more."
Playing competitive golf at a high level is nothing new to Plourde, who started golfing when she was 5 and calls Samoset Resort her home course.
This summer, Plourde won the Maine Junior Championship at Val Halla Golf Course, then finished second in the Maine Women's Amateur at Penobscot Valley Country Club.
Plourde said she's worked hard over her high school career to improve her short game, particularly her chipping from within 50 yards.
"Her basics and her foundation are good but her short game is phenomenal," said Brackett, who often plays against Plourde in practice situations. "Just when you think you're going to go one-up on her and you've got a 4-footer for birdie, she rolls in her 15-footer."
Plourde is looking forward to playing in college, in part because she wants to experience being part of a women's team and playing competitive golf around the country. She hasn't made a decision yet but is looking seriously at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, a Division III program that was nationally ranked in 2016.
In Maine high school golf, there are no girls' teams, meaning Plourde is usually matched up against a boy in the team events.
"Playing against the guys during the school season has become a routine and doesn't bother me much," Plourde said. "I wouldn't say beating them has become a routine because I could have lost at any point during the season. No match is a given win. But don't get me wrong, I love winning, especially against the guys." Steve Craig can be reached at 791-6413 or: scraig@pressherald.com Twitter: SteveCCraig

Texto completo:   Italy is SalonCapri co-owner Nicholas Penna's vacation destination of choice, but he also has a soft spot for Ogunquit, Maine. The Milton native, who lives in Newton with his wife, Amy, and their three children, is lead stylist of SalonCapri, which has locations in Boston (on Newbury Street), Dedham, and Newton. Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the salon's founding by Penna's parents, Nick and Gina, in Hyde Park. We caught up with Penna, 43, to talk all things travel.
Favorite vacation spot? Barcelona [because] it's a super cool, bohemian city and it has a little bit of everything. It's Old World Europe mixed with a cosmopolitan city. There are Michelin star restaurants and side street tapas joints, cool boutique shopping, a beach scene, and the people are just so sexy. Also, anywhere in Italy holds a place in my heart, and I would never turn down an opportunity to visit my parents' homeland (they're from Abruzzo).
Favorite food or drink while vacationing? While in Barcelona, I like to order a regional wine like a cava with some Serrano ham.
Where would you like to travel to but haven't? Australia for the amazing surf and rugged, raw beauty. I haven't been there yet because it's too far! I also have yet to explore any Scandinavian countries, but they are on my short bucket list because of their emerging food scenes and chic style.
One item you can't leave home without when traveling? My wife, Amy, because we are travel twins. She does a lot of research beforehand so we don't miss any must-see places, and she keeps us on track with a schedule.
Aisle or window? An aisle seat because I don't like to disturb anyone and I'm able to move around more.
Favorite childhood travel memory? My family started traveling to Maine at a young age and we completely fell in love with the Maine coastline because of its peacefulness. We ended up getting a beach house up there [in Ogunquit] years later, and it has become a family home where we spend our summers.
Guilty pleasure when traveling? My wife and I like to research the coolest boutiques and any hip new designers and we usually end up splurging on a little shopping when we're in a new place. For instance, last time we went to Barcelona, we sought out a little place that sells handmade espadrilles so my wife could snag a pair.
Best travel tip? If it doesn't fit in the carry-on, don't bring it. Even if you're traveling for a week or longer.

Cities and towns put brakes on marijuana

Texto completo:   It will be at least nine months before the state develops rules for legal marijuana sales, but towns and cities are scrambling to develop local rules for stores, grow operations and social clubs. Some plan to allow all three types of businesses in certain parts of town, but other towns - particularly where residents voted against the initiative - are looking to ban them entirely.
Maine municipalities embrace temporary moratoriums on pot-related businesses in an effort to adjust more gradually to change.
The Nov. 8 vote to legalize recreational marijuana in Maine has opened the door to the fastest-growing industry in the country and raised the prospect of cultivation warehouses in suburban industrial parks, cannabis shops on Main Streets and marijuana social clubs in quaint tourist towns.
But cities and towns around the state aren't rolling out the green carpet.
Since Maine voted to legalize marijuana last month, nearly two dozen towns have discussed or implemented moratoriums to stop any marijuana-related businesses from setting up shop and to give themselves time to develop local regulations. And at least three towns are considering becoming "dry towns" that won't allow retail marijuana facilities.
"Right now, this is the hottest topic we have," says Eric Conrad, spokesman for the Maine Municipal Association, which has fielded questions about marijuana from nearly 40 municipal officials.
The marijuana law, which passed by a margin of about 4,000 votes, includes provisions that the bill's authors say are intended to allow strong local control. Towns can regulate the number, location and operation of retail marijuana stores, cultivation, manufacturing and testing facilities and social clubs, and can also impose a local licensing requirement. They can also become dry towns by implementing an outright ban on all marijuana business. Private marijuana possession and growing will still be allowed even in towns that ban retail businesses.
"We put those measures in place because local control is enshrined in the Maine Constitution and we believe that towns know what's best for them," said Paul McCarrier, president of Legalize Maine and an author of the law.
While the majority of towns discussing the issue have implemented or are considering a moratorium, others are taking a wait-and-see approach as the state develops rules and licensing, or are working on local regulations without a temporary ban in place. Municipal leaders in several cities say they are confident they have plenty of time to sort out zoning issues while the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry spends the next nine months developing rules and licensing regulations for the program. State licenses aren't expected to be issued until early 2018.
The Maine Municipal Association is advising municipalities to adopt 180-day moratoriums to prevent "unwanted developments" with new marijuana businesses until local regulations are approved, Conrad said. Towns will need that time to navigate a whole host of issues, from who will issue local licenses to how to regulate odor.
"What's complicating it, of course, is how the ground is shifting all the time," Conrad said. "There are a lot more questions than answers right now."
McCarrier said he is not surprised so many towns are considering moratoriums, given the complexity of implementing the new law.
"Sometimes the word moratorium can seem scary or discouraging to people, but I don't think it should be viewed that way," he said. "The towns want to do things properly and that takes time."
TOWNS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
The close vote on Question 1 at the state level was mirrored in many municipalities, where the vote was almost evenly split. Conrad said that can put town leaders in the tough position of navigating the issue without a clear mandate from voters.
"What's happening at the local level is a reflection of how society feels about marijuana," he said. "Our local government officials are sort of caught in the middle. They're trying to manage a situation where citizens' reactions can range from 'It's legal and I want to get it here' to 'I don't want it in my town.' That's a tough situation."
The Westbrook City Council was the first city in Maine to signal that it may ban marijuana stores and social clubs. Before the Nov. 8 vote, city councilors voted in favor of a 180-day moratorium on recreational marijuana facilities. A majority of councilors expressed interest in banning any facilities used for selling, growing, testing or using recreational marijuana.
On Election Day, Westbrook residents voted 5,502 to 4,313 in favor of legalizing marijuana.
Council President Brendan Rielly said councilors will consider that vote during their discussions and will seek more public input, but he believes the majority of councilors are still interested in pursuing a ban.
"It wasn't an overwhelming vote and there was a lot of confusion about what was actually being voted on," he said. "On the flip side of that, we had a vote on our local officials. Most of the local officials who were re-elected or elected had taken a position in favor of the moratorium."
Rielly said the council, which includes two new members, will meet as soon as possible to figure out if the city will pursue a ban or develop local restrictions. He remains concerned about the impact of legal marijuana on the community, especially when it comes to the costs he believes the city will face if it allows pot shops to open.
"I have no interest in trying to wade into regulating it. There is a tremendous cost both in time and in money in trying to regulate (marijuana businesses)," Rielly said. "I know the proponents speak about it as an economic development tool, but I don't think that's accurate. It ignores the cost side of the register. We have to spend money to license, enforce, for police and to deal with legal challenges if at some point we deny a license or take one away."
The legalization law includes a provision that residents could use to force a townwide vote if town councilors or selectmen implement a ban that is out of line with what residents want, McCarrier said.
"There are a lot of generational views on cannabis. You have people who might have a personal negative view of cannabis and might be out of touch with what the public wants in general," he said. "We wanted to give the citizenry the tools necessary in case municipalities are banning cannabis facilities and citizens don't feel that was right."
In Somerset County, Skowhegan selectmen decided to pursue becoming a dry town after residents voted 2,152 to 1,897 against Question 1. The planning board will develop an ordinance to ban marijuana businesses in town that is expected to be voted on by residents at the Town Meeting in June.
Selectmen said during their Nov. 22 meeting that they were pursuing the ban because of public opinion and the difficulty of restricting marijuana businesses in town.
"We don't have zoning, so we have limited abilities on restrictions," said Town Manager Christine Almand.
If Skowhegan residents decide not to become a dry town, officials will ask them to implement a moratorium to allow town staff time to figure out how to handle marijuana businesses. Skowhegan has a local controlled-substance facility ordinance in place regulating methadone clinics and medical marijuana dispensaries, but Almand said it is unclear if the town can use the same ordinance to regulate recreational marijuana businesses.
In Oakland, town councilors are considering becoming a dry town rather than implementing a moratorium and local restrictions. Town Manager Gray Bowman told councilors last month that because the town's comprehensive plan isn't updated and the town doesn't have zoning, it can't enforce a moratorium. Town residents voted 1,914 to 1,620 against Question 1.
Cities and towns in Maine that have implemented 180-day moratoriums include Portland, Gray, Brewer, Bangor, Farmington and Wells. Others - including South Portland, Vassalboro, Richmond, Gardiner, Augusta, Windham, Raymond, Winslow and Clinton - are considering moratoriums or scheduling townwide votes to enact them.
The Freeport Town Council is expected to vote this month on a moratorium, which town planner Donna Larson says will give councilors "time to be thoughtful on how they want to handle" marijuana businesses.
"We want to make sure we give it the careful consideration it deserves without the pressure of having actual applications to review," she said.
'SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE'
The Rockland City Council held a community discussion last week about marijuana legalization, the first step in what Mayor Will Clayton sees as an important process to gauge "where the community wants to go with this." On Nov. 8, 55 percent of residents voted in favor of legalizing marijuana.
"It's still something that was fairly close," Clayton said. "Rather than the council simply providing direction, we want the direction to come from everyone working collaboratively."
The council consensus so far is to not "completely reject" marijuana businesses and to bring proposed regulations forward as soon as February, Clayton said. Councilors will meet for a workshop in January to consider how to proceed.
Last week, Rockland Main Street Inc. conducted an anonymous survey of people with connections to the city to gauge how they feel about marijuana businesses. The survey drew about 200 responses, 400 percent higher than any survey done by the organization in the past three years.
The survey shows that 45 percent of respondents oppose having a marijuana business in the downtown district, while 40 percent favor it. Fifteen percent are undecided. More people - about 50 percent - favor allowing a marijuana store anywhere in the city, but about 20 percent of people said they are unsure.
"We wanted to do something proactive once we learned an individual businessperson had expressed interest in opening a marijuana shop of some type in downtown Rockland," said Gordon Page Sr., executive director of Rockland Main Street.
After reviewing the survey results, the organization's board decided not to take a position on how the city should deal with marijuana businesses.
"Even on the board, there's a split of people in favor and people not in favor," Page said. "With the survey results, there was not a big consensus one way or the other."
Clayton said the survey will be a valuable tool for councilors to consider during upcoming discussions, even if the results were "split down the middle."
"With this particular topic, it gave us a good idea of what people are thinking," he said. "When you're talking about a drug that has been illegal for so long, there's a stigma on it. It's easier for people to open up when it's anonymous."
MOVING ON LOCAL ORDINANCES
Two York County cities are moving forward with developing local land-use ordinances and regulations without a moratorium in place. Despite already fielding inquiries from people interested in opening marijuana businesses, Sanford and Saco officials say they have plenty of time to develop local rules before the state starts issuing licenses.
Sanford City Manager Steve Buck said his staff and the City Council spent a year looking at how to zone and regulate retail medical marijuana businesses that had moved to town as the medical program grew in popularity. That process involved input from medical marijuana growers who helped city officials learn about how their cultivation businesses operate. Staff also looked to Colorado for guidance on how to deal with fire safety issues.
Throughout that entire process, Buck had his eye on the recreational marijuana bill.
"We did that (medical marijuana work) with the mindset that this act might pass," he said. "A lot of communities, because they thought they couldn't do anything with medical marijuana, want to take a pause and start that work. We've done our work."
In January, the city's zoning subcommittee will begin the rule-making process, with a primary focus on retail stores and social clubs, Buck said. He said the City Council could still decide to say no to those businesses, but so far councilors haven't expressed interest in a ban.
"When we look at our vote counts for Question 1, we had 54 percent of our voters say yes and 46 percent say no," Buck said. "The committee's recognition is that, given that tally in our community, they likely won't say no to sales and social clubs altogether."
Like Sanford, Saco recently went through a long process of developing zoning for medical marijuana businesses. City councilors and staff will now turn their attention to doing the same for recreational businesses.
City Administrator Kevin Sutherland said the Saco City Council could impose a ban, but at this point councilors seem more interested in developing zoning and licensing requirements and allowing new businesses to open in the city.
"Considering that six of the seven wards voted in favor of it, I don't think there's an appetite among councilors to ban it," he said.
Sutherland said he has worked closely with the Maine Municipal Association to gather information to pass along to city councilors. The planning staff will soon start working on those local regulations, which will go to the planning board and City Council for approval. Sutherland estimates that process could take three months and will likely include input from communities in states with legal marijuana.
"We don't have to go it alone," he said. "There are other communities across the country we can look to. We can call Colorado, Washington or Oregon and we will do that." Gillian Graham can be contacted at 791-6315 or at: ggraham@pressherald.com Twitter: grahamgillian

Getting law on the side of fighting invasives

Texto completo:   Invasive plants became invasive because people - homeowners or government workers - believed they served a useful purpose, and they deliberately planted them. The plants may have been selected for their looks or their ability to control erosion or grow fast and thus provide screening.
At the time, no one realized these plants lacked natural controls in their new regions, so would spread unmitigated. Now, decades later, the state government is stepping in to ban the propagation, sale, purchase, import or export of any plant deemed invasive, "likely invasive" or "potentially invasive" in Maine.
When the invasive-plant ban is approved - and it is expected to be, perhaps as early as the end of January - it will be long overdue. Maine is now the only New England state without some controls on terrestrial (growing in the ground) invasive plants.
At a recent Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry public hearing in Augusta on the proposed regulations, the half dozen people who testified - mostly landscapers and environmentalists - all supported the general idea, but they questioned some of the specifics.
Two things surprised me about the proposed regulations and the hearing itself: the number of plants on the list, which ran to 33 species (and with cultivars, varieties and hybrids is even longer) and the potential for the list to grow; with warming temperatures, more plants will have to be added.
Banning the sale of invasive plants is a good step, but to be effective it must be coupled with efforts to remove the invasive plants that are already taking over Maine's forests and fields. Eradication, if it is even possible, will take a lot of time and money.
"What happened with invasive plants is that people were looking for simple solutions to complex problems," Bob Bittenbender said at the hearing. Though his business card identifies him as a "curmudgeon environmentalist," he has worked as groundskeeper for Maine Audubon Society's Gilsland Farm in Falmouth, and he volunteers to document invasive plants in public spaces in Portland.
Often the people looking for those simple solutions were government employees, Bittenbender added, which prompted State Horticulturist Gary Fish, who chaired the hearing, to display posters the government printed decades ago that urge the use of the very plants now considered invasive.
Several people in the audience admitted that they had planted or sold invasive plants, acts they now regret.
Gardeners liked these plants because they grow easily, require little maintenance and are difficult to kill - all the reasons they now out-compete native plants. Wildlife, however, feels otherwise; Maine's wildlife co-evolved with Maine's native plants, which provide the food and shelter that make them healthiest. In addition, when a region loses its native ecosystems it loses its identity, the things that make its forests and fields look different from other places around the world.
Laura Zitske of Maine Audubon said invasive plant prohibitions are overdue and needed to prevent expense and work for foresters and farmers. The berries from such plants, she said, provide less nutrition for birds and other animals than native berries and are often diuretics, which don't do the animals any good, either. The proposed rules might also "save stubborn people such as myself from blood, sweat and tears as they work to remove such species as Asiatic bittersweet from their own property."
Some people worried that certain plants were left off the state's prohibition list, while other plants didn't belong there.
Swallow-wort, for one, is not on the list, though it is widely considered an invasive plant. But swallow-wort was introduced to Maine accidentally and has never been propagated or sold, so banning its sale or propagation is unnecessary.
Bittenbender cited several other plants he sees taking over public lands in Portland that are absent from the list. Littleleaf linden was planted along Baxter Boulevard, and he says it is spreading around Back Cove. Privet is rampant in the Riverside trolley park area. The callery pear is taking over a slope by East End School. Japanese tree lilacs are spreading. European mountain ash grows on its own in a lot of city parks, and while it might not be invasive now, when the climate gets warmer it could be.
Rugosa rose, the beach rose so common along the Maine coast, elicited some back and forth. Bittenbender argued for its inclusion on the banned list, saying it is in many state parks and spreads much faster than other roses. But Jeff O'Donal, of O'Donal's Nursery in Gorham, countered that the rugosa is a good colonizing plant, which means that while it will spread in an area, it won't jump great distances. Also, it requires sandy soil and full sun to grow. For those reasons, he does not consider it invasive.
He also requested an exception to the ban on all Euonymus alatus cultivars because, he said, several scientific studies offer sound evidence that 'Rudy Haag,' a cultivar that O'Donal propagates and sells, does not produce viable seeds.
Mark Faunce, a past president of the Maine Landscape and Nursery Association and an employee at a wholesale plant company, testified that he would like the regulations rewritten to reflect regional differences. He argued that plants that are invasive in the growing zone around Kittery would not be invasive, and could even be a staple, of the industry in Fort Kent.
As written, the proposed regulations give nurseries one year after they take effect to continue to sell any plants on the list. O'Donal and Faunce called for that transition time to be extended to three years, as has been done in other states adopting invasive-plant lists, because plants propagated now will not be ready for sale within a year - and the nurseries stand to lose a lot of money.
After the hearing, Fish said the Invasive Terrestrial Plants Committee that developed the regulations will review the testimony and consider possible changes.
If it makes no changes, it could vote immediately and the regulations would take effect 30 days later. Changes, of course, would delay the timetable.
I have followed the debate on invasive plants for 20 years, and I am glad that Maine is joining the responsible horticultural world and adopting a list. I've never heard of some of the plants on the list. Others, like multiflora rose, bittersweet and bishop's weed (which a friend calls "the pernicious weed"), I battle regularly.

Texto completo:   sustainable activity of the week
You think you've got it tough in winter? As we write this, we are looking at the Time & Temperature Building in Portland, which is recording a chilly 12 degrees. Luckily, we're sitting in our pleasant, centrally heated offices drinking hot coffee. When our work day is done, most of us will head out to our heated cars to drive home, and we'll spend the evening in our comfortably heated homes.
Any foraging necessary for dinner will take place at the (heated) grocery store. We didn't need to bury our nuts last fall nor put on weight to last us through the hardship season. As long as we have a bit of cash or credit to our name, we needn't worry about where dinner is coming from.
Now imagine you are a white-tailed deer, a red fox, a porcupine, a honeybee or any of the many Maine creatures that must make it through a long, cold winter with no central heating and no supermarket.
On Wednesday, the longest night of the year, you and yours can assist these critters in a small way at the Winter Solstice Celebration at Fields Pond Audubon Center near Bangor. The event takes its cues from Eve Bunting's children's book "Night Tree"; you'll decorate trees with edible treats for the animals, things like popcorn chains and apples - and afterwards, you can treat yourself to warm cider. - Staff report
Night Tree: Winter Solstice Celebration at Fields Pond, a family-oriented celebration of nature in winter. Help recreate Eve Bunting's classic story "Night Tree," decorating forest trees to share with Maine's winter wildlife. $15 per family for members, $20 for nonmembers; advance registration recommended. Fields Pond Audubon Center, Holden. 4-5:30 p.m. Wednesday.

Texto completo:   The University of Maine has named Nick Derba its interim baseball coach, the school announced Saturday.
Derba, an associate head coach since 2015, replaces Steve Trimper, who is leaving Maine to become the head coach at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida.
Derba, 31, has been a member of the Maine staff for the past three seasons. He played six seasons as a catcher in the St. Louis Cardinals farm system after playing two seasons under Trimper at Manhattan College, when Trimper served as the coach before going to Maine.
"I'm excited for the opportunity to be the head coach at Maine for the spring of 2017," Derba said in a press release. "From here on out, it's business as usual. Our goals do not change, as we will continue to work and build a victorious path towards the America East Championship."
Trimper had been the head coach at Maine since 2005, compiling a 309-292-2 record in 11 seasons. He signed a three-year contract extension in April. Under Trimper, Maine qualified for the NCAA tournament twice - in 2006 and 2011.
"Over his 11 seasons at the University of Maine, Coach Trimper guided the Black Bears to substantial accomplishments, including a pair of NCAA regional appearances and over 300 wins," said Maine Athletic Director Karlton Creech.
"We are grateful for his contributions to our program and wish he and his family continued success."
Trimper will succeed Pete Dunn, who announced his retirement earlier this week after 37 seasons. Dunn ranks 15th in NCAA Division I history with 1,312 wins.
"As my family and I embark on a new opportunity at Stetson University, I want to take this opportunity to thank the many players, coaches and UMaine supporters that have made the past 11 years of my career truly remarkable," Trimper said.
The Maine athletic department said it will conduct a national search for a permanent head coach after the 2016-17 season.

No bull? That's why farmers call her

Texto completo:   We Meet Freeport resident Carolyn Woerter, who sells and transports bull semen all around the state, for both cattle and beef breeding.
When we first met Carolyn Woerter of Freeport it was a blazing hot August day and she had her truck loaded up with some mysterious-looking cannisters. Being nosy, we asked what they were and immediately asked for her number. Because how often do you meet a woman with a truck full of bull semen? We called Woerter up to find out more about how she got into the business of delivering bull semen to farms around Maine.
LEGACY: Woerter inherited the business, in a sense. This was her husband's work for 35-plus years, and she watched him get up every morning excited to go to work, which entailed driving around Maine visiting farms (mostly dairy then) to deliver "product," aka the semen. Frankly, she felt a little jealous as she headed off to her retail job in furniture. He worked for ABS, the Wisconsin-based worldwide leader in bovine reproduction services and technologies. "That anyone could get up and enjoy their work that much," Woerter says, "I thought, how lucky is that?"
She also feared that the business he'd worked so hard to build up would disappear without him. So after his death at 73, she picked up his client list and stepped into a new career.
STATE OF AFFAIRS: Back in the day, when Maine's dairy business was thriving, Woerter's husband served a section of Maine, dividing up the workload with other ABS representatives. Today, Woerter has almost all of it to herself, with just a small southern slice of the state tended to by an ABS representative in New Hampshire. "I've got a couple of herds in the Cornish area, so I go from there up into Farmington, over to Dover-Foxcroft and down to the coast."
Unlike her husband, Woerter does not provide the insemination service itself; that's left to farmhands or the farmers themselves these days.
SALES PITCH: New "proofs" come out three times a year, and Woerter tends to deliver those catalogs, which outline the bull's production and genetic traits as a sire, in person. "I will be on the road most of the end of this month making sure they have that information," she says. Her style is not to be particularly pushy with the product. "It's about cow families, and basically what a particular farm is looking for to improve their own herds," she says. "Basically the farmers know their cattle really well and we don't want to go in and say 'We think you should use this bull or whatever.' "
Her respect for farmers and the thin margins they live within is deep. "They work very hard for what they make. They have to be very wise about how they go about it, how they spend their money, what is most profitable. Obviously, like any wise shopper, they are always shopping."
BUSY TIMES? Woerter is on the road regularly, but maybe a bit more in some seasons. "August is a busy time," she says. "In the heat of the summer, the cattle tend not to settle as well." Settle, meaning get pregnant, or to use a term made famous by William Faulkner, "light in August." That's when Woerter might have to head back to the farm with another batch of product.
SPECIAL DELIVERY: Speaking of, how does she get it? "UPS!" It arrives in a dry vapor tank. She places orders every week or every other week. "It comes in and I deliver it. I can give them a pretty good idea when to expect it (this so that delivery can be timed with a cow going into heat), unless it is back ordering." Say what? "If it is one of these bulls that doesn't produce as much as it should," she explains. Aha. So there is such a thing as a bull that's too popular for its own good.
FIELD NOTES: Woerter has observed a shift in recent years as Maine's dairy industry contracts and more farmers get into raising beef herds. She hates to see a farm go. "It is discouraging to see all these farms that have gone by the wayside with no one to take over and they have to sell their property." Because, as she puts it, "They don't make land. Once it is gone, it is done."
In Freeport, where she lives, she sees the steady march of development. That's why she's so determined to hold onto her land, which is about 100 acres of active woodlot. She doesn't do any harvesting herself, does she? "If I could I would," she laughs. "I have the forester come in." She'll keep at that. "As long as I can. But around me, I am being squeezed to exactly the land I own."
JOY IN THE MORNING? Does she feel, as her husband did, excited to go to work? "Yes I do." She's 73 now herself, so one wonders if she's thinking about retiring. "I felt at one point, maybe it is time. Then I thought about it, and I couldn't go through with it." Because the more she thought about it, the more she realized she'd miss hitting the road. "I'd miss the people," she says. Mary Pols can be contacted at 791-6456 or at: mpols@pressherald.com

Resumen: SMITHFIELD, R.I. -- One stat jumped off the page after Maine's 77-52 women's basketball victory Saturday over Bryant: The Black Bears scored 31 points off 24 Bulldogs turnovers. The way we get that time and space is by having shooters around them. Because we have people who can face up and stretch the defense out, it allows us to score around the basket a little bit better.

Texto completo:   SMITHFIELD, R.I. -- One stat jumped off the page after Maine's 77-52 women's basketball victory Saturday over Bryant: The Black Bears scored 31 points off 24 Bulldogs turnovers.
"We've always been a good defensive team," Maine Coach Richard Barron said. "It's just part of our culture. I think our kids buy into that. In the first half especially, I thought our defense was really good."
Maine scored 25 points off 15 first-half turnovers. The Black Bears (6-5) also hit a season-high 12 3-pointers, shooting 54.5 percent from behind the arc. After struggling on 3-pointers early in the season, Maine now has drained 37 over its last four games.
"We've got good shooters," Barron said. "It's important for our post players to have good shooters around them because we have post players who can score one-on-one inside. And our guards can as well.
"But to do that we need to have time and space. The way we get that time and space is by having shooters around them. Because we have people who can face up and stretch the defense out, it allows us to score around the basket a little bit better. We don't have huge size.
"We don't lob the ball inside. But we do have people who can score around the basket and they just need time to do that. The only way you can do that is to have shooters on the court."
Three Black Bears reached double figures: Sigi Koizar (20 points), Tanesha Sutton (12) and Blanca Millan (11).
Sydney Holloway led Bryant (4-6) with 16 points, while Alex Klein chipped in with 11.
Bryant grabbed an early 14-10 lead, but Maine countered with an 18-2 run that enabled the Black Bears to end the first quarter with a 28-16 lead.
During the run, Sutton scored five points and dished out two assists.
"We shot the ball really well during that first quarter (73.3 percent)," Barron said. "We were moving the ball well. The shots we were taking were good open shots, so our shot selection was really good.
"I thought our attack off the dribble was sound. We only had two first-half turnovers because we were making good decisions. Again, our offense led to open shots and we hit them. I thought we were very unselfish in the way we played."
Maine continued to pour it on in the second quarter as it outscored Bryant 17-9 to build a 45-25 lead at halftime.
Bryant, though, made a run of its own in the second half and sliced its deficit to 58-48 with 8:26 remaining.
Maine slammed the door by going on a 19-4 run, with Koizar converting a three-point play and Tihana Stojsavilevic burying a 3-pointer.
"I was really happy with the energy that we responded with after they cut it to 10," Barron said.
"We really challenged them during a timeout. That's when Tihana gave us a big energy boost coming in, and the bench responded as well."

For the derided f-35, defense from higH

Autor: Woodard, Colin.

Información de publicación: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]. 18 Dec 2016: B.2.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/derided-f-35-defense-high/docview/1849821855/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: In Maine, the F-35 work at Pratt & Whitney has been championed by Republican Collins and independent King, as well as Democratic U.S. Rep.

Texto completo:   President-elect Donald Trump's Dec. 12 tweet lambasting the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program as "out of control" created some worries in York County, where the program supports nearly 1000 jobs.
Blasted by the president-elect as wasteful, the military planes that are partially made in Maine won't be grounded without a fight.
President-elect Donald Trump's tweet lambasting the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program as "out of control" has created worries in York County, where the program supports nearly 1,000 jobs.
"The F-35 program and cost is out of control," Trump tweeted last week, causing shares of manufacturer Lockheed Martin to tumble 3 percent. "Billions of dollars can be saved on military (and other) purchases after Jan. 20," the day he becomes president.
Engine components for the F-35 are made at Pratt & Whitney's North Berwick facility, and other parts are made at General Dynamics in Saco. The F-35 program employs 960 Mainers directly or indirectly and injects $84 million into the Maine economy each year, according to a joint statement sent to the Maine Sunday Telegram by U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King.
"That contract provides security for Pratt & Whitney and literally hundreds of jobs for people who wake up and go to work every day to provide for their families," said former Maine House Speaker Mark Eves, who lives in North Berwick. "If it were to go away, it would be pretty devastating for people's ability to bring home a good paycheck."
The F-35 generated such demand for precision machinists that York County Community College in Wells created a program in 2013 to train them, even though there were already similar programs at two other Maine community colleges.
"Sometimes students are offered jobs while they are still students," said college president Barbara Finkelstein. "We have to press on them that we'd like to get them the degrees."
It's not the first time Trump has criticized the F-35, a program that now costs $400 billion, about twice initial estimates. In October 2015, Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt the plane doesn't perform as well as the much less expensive aircraft it is slated to replace.
"What are we doing, and spending so much more money?" he said.
The F-35 has been troubled. Originally intended to be an inexpensive, adaptable and reliable aircraft that could be used by the Navy, Air Force, Marines, and our overseas allies, it has turned into one of the most expensive in history and notoriously unreliable. The Pentagon had to ground all F-35s at least 13 times between 2007 and 2014, mostly because of problems with the Pratt & Whitney's engine's turbine blades.
Trump may discover that the program is almost impossible to kill because the work has been spread around almost every state and so has near-universal congressional support.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for instance, fought hard to ensure an F-35 wing will be deployed with the Vermont National Guard in Burlington in 2020.
"For better or worse, that is the plane of record right now, and it is not gonna be discarded," he told a local reporter in 2015. "That's the reality."
In Maine, the F-35 work at Pratt & Whitney has been championed by Republican Collins and independent King, as well as Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree (who fought against funding for a rival Rolls-Royce engine) and Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who suggested Lockheed should move production work to the former Brunswick Naval Air Station to shorten supply chains.
LePage, a supporter of Trump, declined to comment on the president-elect's tweet. "Neither the Governor or anyone else can speculate on what the President-Elect may or may not do," his spokeswoman, Adrienne Bennett, said by email.
Eves suggested the governor should use any influence he might have with the president-elect to protect the F-35. "If he has any sway with the incoming administration, now would be the time to use it and to talk about what would be the impact," he said.
In their statement, Collins and Kings praised the F-35 as "the world's most advanced, multi-role fighter aircraft" and "a critical component of our national security. The value of the F-35 program is demonstrated by the fact that costs are coming down and our allies share the burden of the costs."
"While there were initial overruns, costs have been reduced significantly since the program's inception, and it is projected to be less expensive than existing, less capable aircraft in fewer than four years," the senators said.
Pingree said the F-35 has been debated for years, "many concerns about costs have been raised, many have been addressed, and there's little to be accomplished in going over that same ground yet again. I think it's critical that this project continue to move forward so we can replace America's aging fleet of fighter and support good-paying jobs in Maine."
"If President-elect Trump is looking to address wasteful Defense spending, I have many ideas," she added Tuesday. "Last week's report that the Pentagon covered up its own plan to identify $125 billion is savings would be just the first."

Texto completo:   Maine faces an acute shortage of engineers in the next decade.
Maine schools will not graduate enough engineers in the next decade to keep up with projected demand, and the shortfall could hamper the state's economic growth.
That's the consensus of engineering professionals and educators who believe that better pay outside Maine will lure graduates away while the state struggles to expand its capacity to train engineers here.
The Maine economy has gained more than 800 new engineering jobs in the last decade, expanding a foundation for high-tech industries, construction and manufacturing. Each engineer working in Maine right now adds $560,000 to Maine's gross domestic product, according to a University of Maine analysis.
But the University of Maine System will produce only half the graduates needed to fill open engineering jobs in the next decade, mostly to replace people who have retired. Approximately 27 percent of Maine's engineering workforce is 55 or older, said Dana Humphrey, dean of the University of Maine College of Engineering in Orono, laying the groundwork for impending shortages. With intense national competition for recent engineering graduates, Maine companies look primarily to the college to recruit new employees.
"If Maine thinks it can solve its shortage of engineers by bringing them in from other places, it is not going to happen," Humphrey added. "It is going to have to produce its own."
Though there is surging interest in engineering from students, the college is stretched to its limits. For the first time, the school had to turn away students from their preferred area of study in 2016, Humphrey said, and that trend is likely to continue.
"We are bursting at the seams," he said.
'WE NEED EVERY ENGINEER WE CAN GET'
A recent projection from the university for 2026 estimates Maine will create 810 new engineering jobs and need to replace 1,750 retiring engineers, plus others who leave the workforce, creating approximately 2,560 openings in all. At the same time, Maine is expected to produce 1,300 graduates to work in the state, leaving a shortfall of at least 1,260. Currently about 60 percent of Maine engineering grads stay in the state.
"We need every engineer we can get plus more, it doesn't matter the discipline," Humphrey said.
Rick McCarthy, executive director of the American Council of Engineering Companies of Maine, echoed Humphrey's call for more engineering grads. He said areas like Boston and parts of California are booming, thanks in part to the critical mass of talented engineers.
"The best way to get those jobs here is to train them here, with the expectation that they stay," McCarthy said.
But he acknowledges when it comes to pay, Maine lags behind many states. The average annual wage for engineering positions in Maine is $72,300, compared to a national average of almost $83,000, according to the U.S. Census Occupational Survey.
Meagan Lewis, a 2016 University of Maine graduate, said higher salary was a reason she took a job as a systems engineer at MITRE Corp., a not-for-profit government contractor in Virginia. The company also had opportunities she couldn't find in Maine, Lewis said. Many of her other friends from Maine also found jobs out of state.
"A few of them just wanted to get out of Maine, they had been there their whole lives, why not see a different part of the country," Lewis said. "The ones who stayed wanted to stay closer to home."
That's Gregory Smiddy's situation. Smiddy, who will graduate from the University of Maine in May, already has a job lined up at the Pratt and Whitney aircraft turbine plant in North Berwick. The job lets him work in aviation and keeps him in Maine, close to his family, Smiddy said.
"I really lucked out; I couldn't be happier with my position once I get out of school," Smiddy said. "To be able to stay in Maine and have a job I really like is something else, it is amazing."
PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE
UMaine is the dominant source for engineering degrees in the state, although some are given at the University of Southern Maine and Maine Maritime Academy in Castine. Enrollment at UMaine's engineering school has increased 74 percent since 2001. Humphrey said approximately 1,800 undergraduate and 200 post-graduate students attend the engineering college. An incoming freshman class has 450-500 students.
The university has invested in state-of-the-art research labs like the Advanced Structures and Composites Center, Humphrey said, but its five academic buildings are aging, cramped, and have laboratory space that is functionally obsolete.
"Our buildings do need to be upgraded, modern facilities to be compatible with how we teach today, not 20 years ago," Humphrey said.
The University of Southern Maine has approximately doubled its enrollment in the past decade to 200 and expects continued growth, said Mariusz Jankowski, chair of the school's engineering department.
"Both institutions recognize the need for increased investment in engineering," Jankowski said. "I would certainly hope that message gets across, and the solution is that we use the opportunity to invest in both institutions, when the decision is made to increase access to engineering in Maine."
That infrastructure is critical to producing engineers in a competitive landscape.
"If the University of Maine is not able to pump them out or is compromised because of a lack of capabilities or other resources, it will further compromise our ability to hire those engineers and hopefully keep them in the state of Maine," said Chuck Padera, president of Kleinschmidt, a 140-employee firm based in Pittsfield with offices in seven states and two Canadian provinces. "Right now, if you are graduating from a qualified engineering school, you get to pick where you want to go; the world truly is your oyster."
'THE REAL QUESTION IS DEMAND'
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the economy will add 67,200 new architecture and engineering jobs, a 3 percent increase, by 2024. According to a 2016 survey from human resources firm ManpowerGroup, 82 percent of companies reported having difficulty finding engineers, even though 95 percent said they were planning to hire in 2016. The survey pointed to similar issues facing Maine, such as a workforce facing retirement age and a need for more education and training of new engineers.
"It is clear the demand for engineers is growing very, very rapidly and has been growing over the past number of years across the country," said David Raymond, president and CEO of the American Council of Engineering Companies. Expanded demand for engineers in new industries like high tech and biotechnology is helping drive the need to produce more graduates across the country, Raymond added.
"The real question is demand," Raymond said. "If demand is sustainable, then the institutions will find a way to fill it."
In a busy market, small firms like Acorn Engineering in Portland have a particularly tough time recruiting new hires. A glut of engineers during the recession turned into a shortage as the economy improved, Acorn owner William Savage said. His company wasn't advertising open jobs, but he recently hired a University of Maine graduate who sent a handwritten letter expressing interest in the company's watershed restoration work.
"Everyone is trying to hire engineers; we can't pass up that opportunity. We hired him on the spot," Savage said. "That is the mentality right now." Peter McGuire can be contacted at 791-6325 or at: pmcguire@pressherald.com Twitter: PeteL_McGuire

Texto completo:   I receive a ton of deer-hunting related questions over the course of the year. One of the most common is: What kind of gun should one get for a first-time deer hunter? As the tradition of a firearm under the Christmas tree is still very much alive and well in Maine, I figured I'd offer some thoughts and perspective.
I imagine my suggestion of putting a gun under the tree will ruffle the feathers of a few. It might even seem a bit out of line in this age of political correctness and paranoia, but if you go back a few years the concept of getting a gun for Christmas is not nearly so outrageous. The 1983 movie "A Christmas Story," the tale of a 9-year-old boy who wants a Daisy Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas, remains among the all-time seasonal classics. A 1950s Sears Christmas catalog ad shows a happy family in front of the Christmas tree in awe over their brand new guns. And countless outdoor magazine stories have been written about a youngster's dream of getting their first deer rifle for Christmas. For those inclined to fulfill those dreams, there are plenty of choices.
Choosing my daughter's first deer rifle was a learning experience. Initially, I chose a New England Firearms/H&R single-shot Handi-Rifle for its simplicity - a good way to start a young hunter, I thought. However, upon adding a base, scope and rings, I discovered the hammer height required mounting the scope so high that it pulled her cheek off the stock. If you go that route, stick with open sights.
As I'm a big proponent of optics, a last-minute scramble resulted in the only other youth rifle I could find, a Remington Model 7 Youth in 7mm-08 WIN. It proved more than adequate, at least for a young lady. The caliber was an ideal compromise, powerful enough to knock down a deer but not so potent she couldn't withstand the recoil. (I know there are plenty of light caliber fans who will disagree, but I wouldn't recommend anything much smaller than the 7mm-08, or my personal favorite, the .308 WIN, for Maine deer.) And, the youth stock would still fit her small frame as an adult.
I knew that wouldn't be the case for my son, so I chose a different route, and after a bit of research came up with the ideal solution. The Mossberg 100 ATR Super Bantam's modular stock uses a system of spacers that allows the rifle to "grow" with the shooter. It has since been supplanted by the Mossberg Patriot Super Bantam that, like the 100 ATR, comes as a kit, including base, rings and mounted scope. And it's a quality gun at a very affordable price.
Because I had more time, I was also able to find one in my preferred .308 WIN, a caliber that, like the gun, can "grow" with the shooter. I started my son out with reduced recoil rounds for the first couple seasons, then switched to standard rounds about the same time I added a 1-inch spacer and recoil pad to make it adult size.
Another intriguing option for a young hunter is the Rossi S20. One model comes with three matched, interchangeable barrels in 20 gauge, .22 cal and .243 WIN. Like the H&R, it's a single-shot hammer gun that comes with rifle sights, but the hammer profile is a bit lower, so it may afford better scope-mounting. And the three barrels allow your youngster to use the same gun for waterfowl and upland birds, small game and target plinking and deer hunting.
While a new gun under the tree will certainly delight its recipient, it's not something to be taken lightly by either the giver or receiver. As of this year, there is no longer a minimum age requirement, so it is up to parents to decide if and when your youngster is ready to take up the hunting tradition. Then, be sure they receive the proper training on safe, responsible handling of firearms.
In the meantime, have a merry Christmas. Bob Humphrey is a freelance writer and registered Maine guide who lives in Pownal. He can be reached at: bhunt@maine.rr.com

Texto completo:   Hundreds of thousands of wreaths being laid at Arlington
ARLINGTON, Va. -- More than 44,000 volunteers braved freezing rain to set hundreds of thousands of donated wreaths at headstones at Arlington National Cemetery on Saturday.
The Wreaths Across America project has become an annual tradition. It began in 1992 when a Maine wreathmaker, Worcester Wreath Co. of Harrington, donated 5,000 wreaths to the cemetery.
Wreaths Across America spokeswoman Amber Caron said more than 44,000 volunteers helped lay 245,000 wreaths at Arlington on Saturday.
The Maine-made wreaths arrived from the Pine Tree State via motorcade, with truckers donating their services to carry the wreaths to veterans' graves. The convey started out in Maine on Dec. 11.
In 2014, the group began putting a wreath on every headstone in Arlington.
Caron says 1.2 million wreaths were placed at nearly 1,230 participating locations across the country. One such ceremony was held Saturday at Oak Grove Cemetery in Gardiner.
Wreaths Across America is headquartered in Columbia Falls.

Texto completo:   The group that opposed the referendum that legalized marijuana in Maine has formally dropped its request for a recount of the close vote last month.
The action, filed Saturday afternoon with the Maine Secretary of State's Office, stopped the recount two weeks into the process. About a fifth of the roughly 760,000 ballots cast by Maine voters on Question 1 had been recounted.
"We promised folks that if we came to a point where we could not see any chance of reversing the result, we would not drag the process out," said Newell Augur, legal counsel for the No on 1 campaign. "We are satisfied that the count and the result are accurate."
The recount of the contentious question, which was narrowly approved by voters on the Nov. 8 ballot, got underway Dec. 5 with both sides claiming they were picking up votes early on in the process.
But as the recount continued, it appeared the tally would not change significantly. Unofficial results of the vote released on Election Day showed the measure passed by 4,073 votes, 381,692 to 377,619.
LEGAL IN 30 DAYS
The anti-legalization campaign gave notice to the director of the Secretary of State's Bureau of Elections on Saturday afternoon to end the recount, which was on hold for a holiday break until January.
"We are excited and grateful that the No on 1 campaign has decided not to drag this out any longer so we can start the business of implementation and responsibly regulate marijuana," said David Boyer, manager of the Yes on 1 campaign.
Boyer said that once the results are certified by the secretary of state, which could happen next week, the measure should become legal 30 days after the governor affirms the result.
"Hopefully sometime in January," said Boyer.
Under the measure, the Legislature has nine months to establish rules to deal with such issues as child-proof packaging, restricting advertising to minors, and licensing.
Boyer said based on the experience of Colorado, the first state to legalize marijuana, stores will be operating about a year after the rule-making is complete.
Officials on both sides of the recount were critical of their opponents during the process, with Yes on 1 accusing opponents of slowing down the recount by not providing enough volunteers. No on 1 criticized legalization proponents of rushing to enact the law.
The recount was expected to take up to a month to complete and cost taxpayers $500,000. Boyer said now that it has stopped, costs should be a lot less and mainly cover the hours put in by Maine State Police troopers, who collected the ballots, and a dozen state employees who helped count ballots with volunteers.
The No on 1 campaign estimated the recount cost at less than $15,000 before it was abandoned.
TAX RECOUNT DROPPED, TOO
Opponents of a measure that will add an income tax surcharge on high-income Mainers, with the money going toward public education, also sought a recount after that question passed by a narrow margin on Election Day. But the effort was abandoned quickly after opponents cited the cost of a recount and the likelihood that the result would not be changed. Opponents also complained about the proposed recount process, which would have involved representatives of both sides on the income tax question and the marijuana referendum forming recount teams to go through the ballots.
Voters' approval of Question 1 will make it legal for adults to possess up to 2 1/2 ounces of marijuana, grow a limited number of plants and buy marijuana at licensed retail stores.
Maine is one of four states - including Massachusetts, California and Nevada - that legalized marijuana last month. Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington previously legalized the drug.
Maine legalized marijuana for medical use in 1999.
Now that the recounts have been dropped, Gov. Paul LePage will have to issue proclamations certifying the results. Both measures will then take effect in January, but implementing both - as well as other referendums that passed last month - is expected to take months.
Voters on Election Day also approved referendums to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020, institute ranked-choice voting and spend more money on transportation projects. A measure that would have adopted stricter rules on gun sales was defeated.

Texto completo:   Profile of Hall Farms in East Dixfield, which has been in the family for 9 generations.
The history of the Hall family's dairy farm in East Dixfield now includes an honor earned through excellence.
EAST DIXFIELD -- In 1816, Allen Hall - one of the first settlers of Winthrop - moved to East Dixfield, where he bought 70 acres of land to farm.
Napoleon was still reeling from his defeat at Waterloo. Indiana had just become the 19th state. James Madison was president - the new country's fourth one.
That was also the infamous "year without a summer" that followed the eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia. The volcano messed with the Earth's weather patterns, and snow fell all over New England in June. Many Maine farmers pulled up roots and headed west, worried that this strange new weather pattern might be permanent.
It might not have been the best time to think about starting a new farm - although, who knows, while Hall was eating the westward pioneers' dust perhaps he purchased the land they left behind for a song. His gamble paid off.
Hall Farms, now being tended by the eighth generation of the Hall family, with the ninth generation waiting in the wings, celebrated its 200th anniversary this year. And it was named the 2016 Maine Dairy Farm of the Year by the New England Green Pastures Program.
Allen Hall probably never dreamed that his farm would grow over the next two centuries to 1,200 acres and do so much more than milk a handful of cows. Under the guidance of the current owners, Rodney and Randy Hall, and previous generations, the farm has added land, switched to organic dairy farming, expanded the barn (you can still see its 19th-century hand-hewn timbers) and built side businesses of beef cattle and maple syrup that are expanding every year.
That 200-year family legacy, 49-year-old Rod Hall says, has felt more like motivation than a burden.
"I don't think that my brother and I have wanted to be the ones that let it fail," he observed on a recent sunny winter day, when his 54-year-old brother was escorting an inspector around the farm. "I don't think we ever wanted to be the ones that, all these generations did it and we got up some morning and sold it. There's been a little more determination to make it a success because so many generations have worked hard to make it a success."
That determination to not lose the farm began with Allen Hall's own family, with the help of the Wilton town selectmen. Old Kennebec County probate records show that in 1825 a judge in Hallowell granted a petition that declared Hall a "spendthrift," whose lack of care handling money would soon "expose himself and his family to want." The judge appointed a guardian over Hall's estate.
After that initial bump in the road, subsequent generations shored up the farm by expanding it - but not too fast - and diversifying into areas that not only helped the farm survive but gave each succeeding generation a better quality of life.
They kept up with the times, whether that meant embracing mechanization in the 1930s, building a new compost barn in the 2000s, following the consumer trend toward local and organic food, or finding a way to milk the cows more efficiently. Like most dairy farmers, they carefully planned their spending on equipment and buildings.
Each generation trained the next, even while pushing the youngest Halls to always have a back-up plan - perhaps, in the long-run making it easier for them to commit themselves to the farm life, because they had other options.
No one knows how many Maine farms have remained in one family for 200 years or more. While other states have developed registries to keep track of such statistics, Maine has not, according to John Bott, director of communications for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
DAIRY FARMS DISAPPEAR
The Hall farm probably didn't start out as a dairy farm, but Rod Hall suspects his ancestor must have had at least one cow.
By the 1880s, local dairy farms were selling their milk to the Dixfield Centre Cheese Factory, and Hall believes his family's farm was part of that group.
"From the stories that I've heard, there were always milk cows here," he said in his classic Maine accent, "and like so many other farms in the state of Maine, they milked a handful of cows. If you had 10, you were big back then."
When Rod Hall was born in 1967, there area was home to three dozen or so dairy farms. Today, there are three. Hall remembers a conversation he had with an inspector when he was a boy. The inspector said "You know, it will be a sad day when there are 1,000 dairy farms in the state of Maine."
"There were 1,300 or 1,400 at the time," Hall said. "Now there's 250. Unfortunately, there is so much capital investment to buy a dairy farm. There's three aspects of the farm you need, and people don't realize that - you've got to have the cattle, you've got to have the buildings, and if you're trying to grow your own feed you've got to have the land and the equipment. It's not that it's impossible, but it would take young people with a lot of determination and a lot of luck."
The farm - the mailing address is in East Dixfield, but the barn and two farmhouses sit in Wilton, Franklin County - was driven solely by horse-and oxen power until 1936, when the family, for the first time, bought a used tractor. The farm began milking registered Holsteins in 1945, and the Halls bought their first new tractor the following year.
When Hall was growing up, the family always milked 30 cows, but harvested a lot of timberland as well. The wood was sold to the local mills and to wood products companies such as Forster Manufacturing, which made toothpicks.
"My great grandfather (Ralph) always kept two pair of horses," Hall said, "and of course they farmed with them in the summertime, but they were always working in the woods in the wintertime."
During the dark days of farming in Maine, in the 1990s, when it seemed as if just about every farm was being sold off for development, Hall Farms was suffering, too.
"My dad and myself, we cut a lot of wood every winter to subsidize the farm, and that got to be discouraging," Hall said. "We were cutting wood to support the cows."
GOING ORGANIC AND DIVERSIFYING
By 2000, Dick Hall was beginning the process of transitioning the farm to his sons. Two years later, the family decided to make the farm an organic dairy farm. It was an economic decision. They knew, if they were going to survive, they'd have to either milk 500 cows and sell conventional milk, or milk 50 cows and sell organic milk.
"We knew we didn't have land base enough to support 500 cows," Hall said, "so we decided that, to stay small, we'd try to milk 50."
They sell their milk to Organic Valley, and it's used to make Stonyfield Farms yogurt.
During tough years, the Halls would delay buying needed equipment until the dairy economy improved. Just three months after the farm went organic, the farm was able to buy a new tractor.
Another thing that has helped the farm's bottom line was the development of two sidelines. Each brother owns his own business, which helps to supplement his family's income, so they aren't entirely dependent on dairy.
Many Maine dairy farms have had to diversify in order to survive. Without the diversification, Hall said, "I don't know that we would have gone out of business, but there would have been more challenges for sure."
Randy Hall always had an interest in beef cattle and had a few growing up, so he expanded on that interest. About 12 years ago, he started a Belted Galloways breeding business. Today he sells semen and embryos as far away as South America.
Rod Hall has had a maple syrup business since high school. In 1986, the first year he tapped commercially, he had 386 taps on the family farm. Next year, with the help of his 17-year-old son, Caleb, Hall hopes to have 6,500 taps. His goals are to have 10,000 taps by 2019 and a new sugarhouse by 2020 or 2021.
Now, 200 years after Allen Hall first set foot on this soil, the heart of the family farm - where the barn and farmhouses lie - has expanded to about 500 acres. There are 400 acres of woodlands across the road, and the rest is scattered around here and there.
LAND ADDED BIT BY BIT
"If there's a piece of land that becomes available and it fits in good for us, we try to buy it if we can," Hall said.
The farm has acquired land in a variety of ways, as Hall learned growing up, listening to stories around the supper table. His great-grandfather once traded a cow for a small piece of land. And the family acquired a field across the road from a Dr. White, the local physician. As he got older, White didn't like to drive at night, so if he had a nighttime emergency to attend to he would call Ralph Hall (Rod's great-grandfather), who would take him to his house call.
Whether it was by purchase or gift, no one knows, but the Hall family ended up with Dr. White's parcel of land.
Rod Hall estimates that, since 2001, the family has invested $300,000 to $400,000 into the farm in capital improvements and buildings.
In 2013, they added a compost barn filled with a bed of shavings for the cows that is tended to every day. The bedding steams and keeps them warm and comfortable.
"The cows just love it," Hall said.
The compost barn was one of the things that caught the attention of the New England Green Pastures Program.
Dairy farms recognized by the Green Pastures Program are chosen for their production records, environmental practices and herd, pasture and crop management, as well as overall excellence.
Gary Anderson, an animal and bioscience specialist with the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, says the Halls have "a cohesive multi-generational farm that works well together."
He also cited the new compost barn that lends itself to "cow comfort," as well as the high-quality organic corn silage and organic grass forage the farm produces.
ONE WHO WANTS TO FARM
What the future holds for Hall Farms will likely be up to Caleb Hall, who is the captain of the football team at Mount Blue High School and will graduate in the spring. So far, at least, he's the only member of the ninth generation of Halls who is interested in farming. (Randy Hall's daughter is going to vet school, and Rod Hall's daughter is in Scotland, studying for her doctorate in international relations.)
Just like his father, Caleb Hall has had no doubt about living the life of a dairy farmer.
"I just don't know any different, and you learn to love what you do," he said. "That's the way I look at it."
Now that he's a senior, Caleb comes home early from school every other day, often bringing a few friends with him. They grab a bite of lunch, then head out into the woods to tap more maple trees, inching closer every day to that goal of 10,000 taps. The teenager knows that he would like to keep expanding the farm and has a lot of ideas about how to run things differently. He knows it won't be easy.
"If I'm the only one taking it on, its going to be a lot harder," he said.
When Rod and Randy Hall were Caleb's age, they both wanted to farm, too, but their father told them they had to go to school first so they'd have a back-up plan for supporting their families. Randy got a four-year degree from the University of New Hampshire, and Rod got a two-year associate's degree from the University of Maine.
Rod Hall says "the hardest thing was for me to go away to college," but now that's exactly what he's asking his son to do as well.
Caleb Hall will study fire science and get paramedic training at Southern Maine Community College. But make no mistake - he'll be coming back to the farm. "If I didn't love what I do, I wouldn't do it," he said.
Rod Hall said he thinks one reason his son is so interested in farming is that he has seen previous generations always investing in the farm, never selling off pieces to pay the bills or buy something they want.
He hopes his son will carry on that tradition.
"No one knows what the future is going to hold," he said, "but right now the future looks good." Meredith Goad can be contacted at 791-6332 or at: mgoad@pressherald.com Twitter: MeredithGoad

Texto completo:   The University of Maine has named Nick Derba as its interim baseball coach, the school announced Saturday.
Derba, an associate head coach since 2015, replaces Steve Trimper, who is leaving Maine to become the head coach at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida.
Derba, 31, has been a member of the Maine staff for the past three seasons. He played six seasons as a catcher in the St. Louis Cardinals farm system after playing two seasons under Trimper at Manhattan College, when Trimper served as the coach before going to Maine.
"I'm excited for the opportunity to be the head coach at Maine for the spring of 2017," Derba said in a press release. "From here on out, it's business as usual. Our goals do not change, as we will continue to work and build a victorious path towards the America East Championship.
Trimper had been the head coach at Maine since 2005, compiling a 309-292-2 record in 11 seasons.
He signed a three-year contract extension in April. Under Trimper, Maine qualified for the NCAA tournament twice - in 2006 and 2011.
"Over his 11 seasons at the University of Maine, Coach Trimper guided the Black Bears to substantial accomplishments, including a pair of NCAA regional appearances and over 300 wins," said Maine Athletic Director Karlton Creech.
"We are grateful for his contributions to our program and wish he and his family continued success."
Trimper will succeed Pete Dunn, who announced his retirement earlier this week after 37 seasons.
Dunn ranks 15th in NCAA Division I history with 1,312 wins.
"As my family and I embark on a new opportunity at Stetson University, I want to take this opportunity to thank the many players, coaches and UMaine supporters that have made the past 11 years of my career truly remarkable," Trimper said.
The Maine athletic department said it will conduct a national search for a permanent head coach after the 2016-17 season.

Engineers in short supply, experts say

Texto completo:   UMaine System likely to produce only half of graduates needed in next decade
Maine schools will not graduate enough engineers in the next decade to keep up with projected demand, and the shortfall could hamper the state's economic growth.
That's the consensus of engineering professionals and educators who believe that better pay outside Maine will lure graduates away while the state struggles to expand its capacity to train engineers here.
The Maine economy has gained more than 800 new engineering jobs in the last decade, expanding a foundation for high-tech industries, construction and manufacturing. Each engineer working in Maine right now adds $560,000 to Maine's gross domestic product, according to a University of Maine analysis.
But the University of Maine System will produce only half the graduates needed to fill open engineering jobs in the next decade, mostly to replace people who have retired. About 27 percent of Maine's engineering workforce is 55 or older, said Dana Humphrey, dean of the University of Maine College of Engineering in Orono, laying the groundwork for impending shortages. With intense national competition for recent engineering graduates, Maine companies look primarily to the college to recruit new employees.
"If Maine thinks it can solve its shortage of engineers by bringing them in from other places, it is not going to happen," Humphrey added. "It is going to have to produce its own."
Though there is surging interest in engineering from students, the college is stretched to its limits. For the first time, the school had to turn away students from their preferred area of study in 2016, Humphrey said, and that trend is likely to continue.
"We are bursting at the seams," he said.
A recent projection from the university for 2026 estimates Maine will create 810 new engineering jobs and need to replace 1,750 retiring engineers, plus others who leave the workforce, creating about 2,560 openings in all. At the same time, Maine is expected to produce 1,300 graduates to work in the state, leaving a shortfall of at least 1,260. Currently about 60 percent of Maine engineering graduates stay in the state.
"We need every engineer we can get plus more. It doesn't matter the discipline," Humphrey said.
Rick McCarthy, executive director of the American Council of Engineering Companies of Maine, echoed Humphrey's call for more engineering graduates. He said areas such as Boston and parts of California are booming, thanks in part to the critical mass of talented engineers.
"The best way to get those jobs here is to train them here, with the expectation that they stay," McCarthy said.
But he acknowledges when it comes to pay, Maine lags behind many states. The average annual wage for engineering positions in Maine is $72,300, compared to a national average of almost $83,000, according to the U.S. Census Occupational Survey.
Meagan Lewis, a 2016 University of Maine graduate, said higher salary was a reason she took a job as a systems engineer at MITRE Corp., a not-for-profit government contractor in Virginia. The company also had opportunities she couldn't find in Maine, Lewis said. Many of her other friends from Maine also found jobs out of state.
"A few of them just wanted to get out of Maine. They had been there their whole lives. Why not see a different part of the country?" Lewis said. "The ones who stayed wanted to stay closer to home."
That's Gregory Smiddy's situation. Smiddy, who will graduate from the University of Maine in May, already has a job lined up at the Pratt and Whitney aircraft turbine plant in North Berwick. The job lets him work in aviation and keeps him in Maine, close to his family, Smiddy said.
"I really lucked out; I couldn't be happier with my position once I get out of school," Smiddy said. "To be able to stay in Maine and have a job I really like is something else. It is amazing."
UMaine is the dominant source for engineering degrees in the state, although some are given at the University of Southern Maine and Maine Maritime Academy in Castine. Enrollment at UMaine's engineering school has increased 74 percent since 2001. Humphrey said about 1,800 undergraduate and 200 postgraduate students attend the engineering college. An incoming freshman class has 450 to 500 students.
The university has invested in state-of-the-art research laboratories such as the Advanced Structures and Composites Center, Humphrey said, but its five academic buildings are aging and cramped, and they have laboratory space that is functionally obsolete.
"Our buildings do need to be upgraded, modern facilities to be compatible with how we teach today, not 20 years ago," Humphrey said.
The University of Southern Maine has approximately doubled its enrollment in the past decade to 200 and expects continued growth, said Mariusz Jankowski, chairman of the school's engineering department.
"Both institutions recognize the need for increased investment in engineering," Jankowski said. "I would certainly hope that message gets across, and the solution is that we use the opportunity to invest in both institutions, when the decision is made to increase access to engineering in Maine."
That infrastructure is critical to producing engineers in a competitive landscape.
"If the University of Maine is not able to pump them out or is compromised because of a lack of capabilities or other resources, it will further compromise our ability to hire those engineers and hopefully keep them in the state of Maine," said Chuck Padera, president of Kleinschmidt, a 140-employee firm based in Pittsfield with offices in seven states and two Canadian provinces. "Right now, if you are graduating from a qualified engineering school, you get to pick where you want to go; the world truly is your oyster."
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the economy will add 67,200 new architecture and engineering jobs, a 3 percent increase, by 2024. According to a 2016 survey from human resources firm ManpowerGroup, 82 percent of companies reported having difficulty finding engineers, even though 95 percent said they were planning to hire in 2016. The survey pointed to problems similar to those in Maine, such as a workforce facing retirement age and a need for more education and training of new engineers.
"It is clear the demand for engineers is growing very, very rapidly and has been growing over the past number of years across the country," said David Raymond, president and CEO of the American Council of Engineering Companies. Expanded demand for engineers in new industries such as high tech and biotechnology is helping drive the need to produce more graduates across the country, Raymond added.
"The real question is demand," Raymond said. "If demand is sustainable, then the institutions will find a way to fill it."
In a busy market, small firms such as Acorn Engineering in Portland have a particularly tough time recruiting new hires. A glut of engineers during the recession turned into a shortage as the economy improved, Acorn owner William Savage said. His company wasn't advertising open jobs, but he recently hired a University of Maine graduate who sent a handwritten letter expressing interest in the company's watershed restoration work.
"Everyone is trying to hire engineers; we can't pass up that opportunity. We hired him on the spot," Savage said. "That is the mentality right now."

Texto completo:   Central Maine towns among nearly 2 dozen to roll out moratoriums
The Nov. 8 vote to legalize recreational marijuana in Maine has opened the door to the fastest-growing industry in the country and raised the prospect of cultivation warehouses in suburban industrial parks, cannabis shops on Main Streets and marijuana social clubs in quaint tourist towns.
But cities and towns around the state aren't rolling out the green carpet.
Since Maine voted to legalize marijuana last month, nearly two dozen towns have discussed or implemented moratoriums to stop any marijuana-related businesses from setting up shop and to give themselves time to develop local regulations. And at least three towns are considering becoming "dry towns" that won't allow retail marijuana facilities.
"Right now, this is the hottest topic we have," said Eric Conrad, spokesman for the Maine Municipal Association, which has fielded questions about marijuana from nearly 40 municipal officials.
The marijuana law, which passed by a margin of about 4,000 votes, includes provisions that the bill's authors say are intended to allow strong local control. Towns can regulate the number, location and operation of retail marijuana stores, cultivation, manufacturing and testing facilities and social clubs, and can impose a local licensing requirement. They also can become dry towns by implementing an outright ban on all marijuana business. Private marijuana possession and growing still will be allowed even in towns that ban retail businesses.
"We put those measures in place because local control is enshrined in the Maine Constitution and we believe that towns know what's best for them," said Paul McCarrier, president of Legalize Maine and an author of the law.
While the majority of towns discussing the issue have implemented or are considering a moratorium, others are taking a wait-and-see approach as the state develops rules and licensing, or are working on local regulations without a temporary ban in place. Municipal leaders in several cities say they are confident they have plenty of time to sort out zoning issues while the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry spends the next nine months developing rules and licensing regulations for the program. State licenses aren't expected to be issued until early 2018.
The Maine Municipal Association is advising municipalities to adopt 180-day moratoriums to prevent "unwanted developments" with new marijuana businesses until local regulations are approved, Conrad said. Towns will need that time to navigate a whole host of issues, from who will issue local licenses to how to regulate odor.
"What's complicating it, of course, is how the ground is shifting all the time," Conrad said. "There are a lot more questions than answers right now."
McCarrier said he is not surprised so many towns are considering moratoriums, given the complexity of implementing the new law.
"Sometimes the word 'moratorium' can seem scary or discouraging to people, but I don't think it should be viewed that way," he said. "The towns want to do things properly, and that takes time."
The close vote on Question 1 at the state level was mirrored in many municipalities, where the vote was almost evenly split. Conrad said that can put town leaders in the tough position of navigating the issue without a clear mandate from voters.
"What's happening at the local level is a reflection of how society feels about marijuana," he said. "Our local government officials are sort of caught in the middle. They're trying to manage a situation where citizens' reactions can range from 'It's legal and I want to get it here' to 'I don't want it in my town.' That's a tough situation."
The legalization law includes a provision that residents could use to force a municipal referendum if city councilors or selectmen implement a ban that is out of line with what residents want, McCarrier said.
"There are a lot of generational views on cannabis. You have people who might have a personal negative view of cannabis and might be out of touch with what the public wants in general," he said. "We wanted to give the citizenry the tools necessary in case municipalities are banning cannabis facilities and citizens don't feel that was right."
In Somerset County, Skowhegan selectmen decided to pursue becoming a dry town after residents voted 2,152-1,897 against Question 1. The Planning Board will develop an ordinance to ban marijuana businesses in town that is expected to be voted on by residents at the Town Meeting in June.
Selectmen said during their Nov. 22 meeting that they were pursuing the ban because of public opinion and the difficulty of restricting marijuana businesses in town.
"We don't have zoning, so we have limited abilities on restrictions," Town Manager Christine Almand said.
If Skowhegan residents decide not to become a dry town, officials will ask them to implement a moratorium to allow town staff time to figure out how to handle marijuana businesses. Skowhegan has a local controlled-substance facility ordinance in place regulating methadone clinics and medical marijuana dispensaries, but Almand said it is unclear if the town can use the same ordinance to regulate recreational marijuana businesses.
In Oakland, town councilors are considering becoming a dry town rather than implementing a moratorium and local restrictions. Town Manager Gray Bowman told councilors last month that because the town's comprehensive plan isn't updated and the town doesn't have zoning, it can't enforce a moratorium. Town residents voted 1,914-1,620 against Question 1.
Cities and towns in Maine that have implemented 180-day moratoriums include Portland, Gray, Brewer, Bangor, Farmington and Wells. Others -- including South Portland, Vassalboro, Richmond, Gardiner, Augusta, Windham, Raymond, Winslow and Clinton -- are considering moratoriums or scheduling communitywide votes to enact them.
The Freeport Town Council is expected to vote this month on a moratorium, which town planner Donna Larson says will give councilors "time to be thoughtful on how they want to handle" marijuana businesses.
"We want to make sure we give it the careful consideration it deserves without the pressure of having actual applications to review," she said.

Texto completo:   UMaine System likely to produce only half of graduates needed
Maine schools will not graduate enough engineers in the next decade to keep up with projected demand, and the shortfall could hamper the state's economic growth.
That's the consensus of engineering professionals and educators who believe that better pay outside Maine will lure graduates away while the state struggles to expand its capacity to train engineers here.
The Maine economy has gained more than 800 new engineering jobs in the last decade, expanding a foundation for high-tech industries, construction and manufacturing. Each engineer working in Maine right now adds $560,000 to Maine's gross domestic product, according to a University of Maine analysis.
But the University of Maine System will produce only half the graduates needed to fill open engineering jobs in the next decade, mostly to replace people who have retired. About 27 percent of Maine's engineering workforce is 55 or older, said Dana Humphrey, dean of the University of Maine College of Engineering in Orono, laying the groundwork for impending shortages. With intense national competition for recent engineering graduates, Maine companies look primarily to the college to recruit new employees.
"If Maine thinks it can solve its shortage of engineers by bringing them in from other places, it is not going to happen," Humphrey added. "It is going to have to produce its own."
Though there is surging interest in engineering from students, the college is stretched to its limits. For the first time, the school had to turn away students from their preferred area of study in 2016, Humphrey said, and that trend is likely to continue.
"We are bursting at the seams," he said.
A recent projection from the university for 2026 estimates Maine will create 810 new engineering jobs and need to replace 1,750 retiring engineers, plus others who leave the workforce, creating about 2,560 openings in all. At the same time, Maine is expected to produce 1,300 graduates to work in the state, leaving a shortfall of at least 1,260. Currently about 60 percent of Maine engineering graduates stay in the state.
"We need every engineer we can get plus more. It doesn't matter the discipline," Humphrey said.
Rick McCarthy, executive director of the American Council of Engineering Companies of Maine, echoed Humphrey's call for more engineering graduates. He said areas such as Boston and parts of California are booming, thanks in part to the critical mass of talented engineers.
"The best way to get those jobs here is to train them here, with the expectation that they stay," McCarthy said.
But he acknowledges when it comes to pay, Maine lags behind many states. The average annual wage for engineering positions in Maine is $72,300, compared to a national average of almost $83,000, according to the U.S. Census Occupational Survey.
Meagan Lewis, a 2016 University of Maine graduate, said higher salary was a reason she took a job as a systems engineer at MITRE Corp., a not-for-profit government contractor in Virginia. The company also had opportunities she couldn't find in Maine, Lewis said. Many of her other friends from Maine also found jobs out of state.

Texto completo:   It's been right in front of us for years, and we hardly noticed. The University of Maine at Farmington became the state's go-to incubator for basketball coaches so gradually that all of a sudden, you look up one day and you realize how many coaches are UMF alumni.
If UMF graduate Steve Clifford, the head coach of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets, was the only one on UMF's coaching resume, it would be impressive. Clifford is not the exception.
This season, according to a list compliled by the UMF sports information office, there are 28 UMF alumni coaching a varsity high school basketball team in Maine.
"I need that athletic outlet," Messalonskee boys coach Peter McLaughlin said. "I love teaching, but there's nothing like coaching and getting ready for a big game."
McLaughlin has a friendly rivalry with some of the coaches with which he attended UMF, guys like Mike Susi, who coaches the Poland girls, Tyler Tracy, coach of the Poland boys, and Travis Magnusson, coach of the Dirigo boys.
"We try to get together as much as possible," McLaughlin said. "We want to get together and show what our programs can do."
McLaughlin credits Dick Meader, the longtime men's basketball coach at UMF, for instilling a love for teaching the game in the latest generation of Beaver coaches.
"I played baseball for (Meader)," McLaughlin said. "We're talking about one of the best coaches in the history of the state of Maine."
Jeannine Paradis, the Maranacook girls basketball coach, credits Meader with starting her coaching career. When Tom Maines was boys basketball coach at Madison, he called Meader, looking for a young coach who could run Madison's junior varsity. Meader suggested Paradis. She spent four years at Madison before moving on to coach the Mt. Blue girls.
"I still had the second semester of my senior year left when I started at Madison," Paradis said. "(Coaching's) my true passion. I love it."
Wade Morrill is in his first season as coach of the Monmouth boys, and he previously coached at Valley and Waterville. The influence of great college coaches at UMF, like Meader, women's basketball coach Jamie Beaudoin, Cyndi Pratt (field hockey and softball) and former men's soccer coach Robert Leib is everywhere. For Morrill, Woody Hanstein, his coach with the UMF rugby team, was an important mentor.
"We just had a good athletic culture at UMF. We had great coaches. Just talk to them. They're just good people," Morrill said. "That connection makes kids want to coach."
It goes deeper than strong, steady hands guiding UMF athletes. The coaching pipeline to Farmingotn goes back decades. A lot of it stems from UMF's education department. The university attracts students predisposed to becomming great teachers. Thos students, in turn, become great coaches. Because, really, isn't coaching just an extension of the classroom?
"Building a team works. The athletic model works (in teaching)," Morrill said. "That's what coaching's all about. A lot of people who go (to UMF) are passionate about working with youth."
"A lot of great teachers went to UMF. Coaching kind of falls in line with that," Paradis said.
With that in mind, there's no doubt UMF will continue to supply Maine with coaches. Maybe Clifford will pave the way for the NBA to call on another Beaver someday. Morrill has seen some of his former players go on to coach, and hopes to see it continue. A big part of coaching is passing on that passion.
"There's no greater compliment for a coach than when one of your players wants to coach," Morrill said. "I can't think of a better compliment."

Texto completo:   Central Maine towns among nearly 2 dozen to roll out moratoriums
The Nov. 8 vote to legalize recreational marijuana in Maine has opened the door to the fastest-growing industry in the country and raised the prospect of cultivation warehouses in suburban industrial parks, cannabis shops on Main Streets and marijuana social clubs in quaint tourist towns.
But cities and towns around the state aren't rolling out the green carpet.
Since Maine voted to legalize marijuana last month, nearly two dozen towns have discussed or implemented moratoriums to stop any marijuana-related businesses from setting up shop and to give themselves time to develop local regulations. And at least three towns are considering becoming "dry towns" that won't allow retail marijuana facilities.
"Right now, this is the hottest topic we have," said Eric Conrad, spokesman for the Maine Municipal Association, which has fielded questions about marijuana from nearly 40 municipal officials.
The marijuana law, which passed by a margin of about 4,000 votes, includes provisions that the bill's authors say are intended to allow strong local control. Towns can regulate the number, location and operation of retail marijuana stores, cultivation, manufacturing and testing facilities and social clubs, and can impose a local licensing requirement. They also can become "dry" towns by implementing an outright ban on all marijuana business. Private marijuana possession and growing still will be allowed even in towns that ban retail businesses.
"We put those measures in place because local control is enshrined in the Maine Constitution and we believe that towns know what's best for them," said Paul McCarrier, president of Legalize Maine and an author of the law.
While the majority of towns discussing the issue have implemented or are considering a moratorium, others are taking a wait-and-see approach as the state develops rules and licensing, or are working on local regulations without a temporary ban in place. Municipal leaders in several cities say they are confident they have plenty of time to sort out zoning issues while the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry spends the next nine months developing rules and licensing regulations for the program. State licenses aren't expected to be issued until early 2018.
The Maine Municipal Association is advising municipalities to adopt 180-day moratoriums to prevent "unwanted developments" with new marijuana businesses until local regulations are approved, Conrad said. Towns will need that time to navigate a whole host of issues, from who will issue local licenses to how to regulate odor.
"What's complicating it, of course, is how the ground is shifting all the time," Conrad said. "There are a lot more questions than answers right now."
McCarrier said he is not surprised so many towns are considering moratoriums, given the complexity of implementing the new law.
"Sometimes the word 'moratorium' can seem scary or discouraging to people, but I don't think it should be viewed that way," he said. "The towns want to do things properly, and that takes time."
The close vote on Question 1 at the state level was mirrored in many municipalities, where the vote was almost evenly split. Conrad said that can put town leaders in the tough position of navigating the issue without a clear mandate from voters.
"What's happening at the local level is a reflection of how society feels about marijuana," he said. "Our local government officials are sort of caught in the middle. They're trying to manage a situation where citizens' reactions can range from 'It's legal and I want to get it here' to 'I don't want it in my town.' That's a tough situation."
The Westbrook City Council was the first city in Maine to signal that it might ban marijuana stores and social clubs. Before the Nov. 8 vote, city councilors voted in favor of a 180-day moratorium on recreational marijuana facilities. A majority of councilors expressed interest in banning any facilities used for selling, growing, testing or using recreational marijuana.
On Election Day, Westbrook residents voted 5,502-4,313 in favor of legalizing marijuana.
Council President Brendan Rielly said councilors will consider that vote during their discussions and will seek more public input, but he believes the majority of councilors are still interested in pursuing a ban.
"It wasn't an overwhelming vote and there was a lot of confusion about what was actually being voted on," he said. "On the flip side of that, we had a vote on our local officials. Most of the local officials who were re-elected or elected had taken a position in favor of the moratorium."
Rielly said the council, which includes two new members, will meet as soon as possible to figure out if the city will pursue a ban or develop local restrictions. He remains concerned about the effect of legal marijuana on the community, especially when it comes to the costs he believes the city will face if it allows pot shops to open.
"I have no interest in trying to wade into regulating it. There is a tremendous cost both in time and in money in trying to regulate (marijuana businesses)," Rielly said. "I know the proponents speak about it as an economic development tool, but I don't think that's accurate. It ignores the cost side of the register. We have to spend money to license, enforce, for police and to deal with legal challenges if at some point we deny a license or take one away."
The legalization law includes a provision that residents could use to force a municipal referendum if city councilors or selectmen implement a ban that is out of line with what residents want, McCarrier said.
"There are a lot of generational views on cannabis. You have people who might have a personal negative view of cannabis and might be out of touch with what the public wants in general," he said. "We wanted to give the citizenry the tools necessary in case municipalities are banning cannabis facilities and citizens don't feel that was right."
In Somerset County, Skowhegan selectmen decided to pursue becoming a dry town after residents voted 2,152-1,897 against Question 1. The Planning Board will develop an ordinance to ban marijuana businesses in town that is expected to be voted on by residents at the Town Meeting in June.
Selectmen said during their Nov. 22 meeting that they were pursuing the ban because of public opinion and the difficulty of restricting marijuana businesses in town.
"We don't have zoning, so we have limited abilities on restrictions," Town Manager Christine Almand said.
If Skowhegan residents decide not to become a dry town, officials will ask them to implement a moratorium to allow town staff time to figure out how to handle marijuana businesses. Skowhegan has a local controlled-substance facility ordinance in place regulating methadone clinics and medical marijuana dispensaries, but Almand said it is unclear if the town can use the same ordinance to regulate recreational marijuana businesses.
In Oakland, town councilors are considering becoming a dry town rather than implementing a moratorium and local restrictions. Town Manager Gray Bowman told councilors last month that because the town's comprehensive plan isn't updated and the town doesn't have zoning, it can't enforce a moratorium. Town residents voted 1,914-1,620 against Question 1.
Cities and towns in Maine that have implemented 180-day moratoriums include Portland, Gray, Brewer, Bangor, Farmington and Wells. Others -- including South Portland, Vassalboro, Richmond, Gardiner, Augusta, Windham, Raymond, Winslow and Clinton -- are considering moratoriums or scheduling communitywide votes to enact them.
The Freeport Town Council is expected to vote this month on a moratorium, which town planner Donna Larson says will give councilors "time to be thoughtful on how they want to handle" marijuana businesses.
"We want to make sure we give it the careful consideration it deserves without the pressure of having actual applications to review," she said.

Texto completo:   The group that opposed the referendum that legalized marijuana in Maine has formally dropped its request for a recount of the close vote last month.
The action, filed Saturday afternoon with the Maine secretary of state's office, stopped the recount two weeks into the process. About a fifth of the roughly 760,000 ballots cast by Maine voters on Question 1 had been recounted.
"We promised folks that if we came to a point where we could not see any chance of reversing the result, we would not drag the process out," said Newell Augur, legal counsel for the No on 1 campaign. "We are satisfied that the count and the result are accurate."
The recount of the contentious question, which voters narrowly approved on the Nov. 8 ballot, got underway Dec. 5 with both sides claiming they were picking up votes early on in the process.
But as the recount continued, it appeared the tally would not change significantly. Unofficial results of the vote released on Election Day showed the measure passed by 4,073 votes, 381,692-377,619.
The anti-legalization campaign gave notice to the director of the secretary of state's Bureau of Elections on Saturday afternoon to end the recount, which was on hold for a holiday break until January.
"We are excited and grateful that the No on 1 campaign has decided not to drag this out any longer so we can start the business of implementation and responsibly regulate marijuana," said David Boyer, manager of the Yes on 1 campaign.
Boyer said that once the results are certified by the secretary of state, which could happen next week, the measure should become legal 30 days after the governor affirms the result.
"Hopefully sometime in January," Boyer said.
Under the measure, the Legislature has nine months to establish rules to deal with such issues as child-proof packaging, restricting advertising to minors, and licensing.
Boyer said based on the experience of Colorado, the first state to legalize marijuana, stores will be operating about a year after the rule-making is complete.
Officials on both sides of the recount were critical of their opponents during the process, with Yes on 1 accusing opponents of slowing down the recount by not providing enough volunteers. No on 1 criticized legalization proponents of rushing to enact the law.
The recount was expected to take up to a month to complete and cost taxpayers $500,000. Boyer said now that it has stopped, costs should be a lot less and mainly cover the hours put in by Maine State Police troopers, who collected the ballots, and a dozen state employees who helped count ballots with volunteers.
The No on 1 campaign estimated the recount cost less than $15,000 before it was abandoned.
Opponents of a measure that will add an income tax surcharge on high-income Mainers, with the money going toward public education, also sought a recount after that question passed by a narrow margin on Election Day. But the effort was abandoned quickly after opponents cited the cost of a recount and the likelihood that the result would not be changed. Opponents also complained about the proposed recount process, which would have involved representatives of both sides on the income tax question and the marijuana referendum forming recount teams to go through the ballots.
Voters' approval of Question 1 will make it legal under state law for adults to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana, grow a limited number of plants and buy marijuana at licensed retail stores.
Maine is one of four states -- the others are Massachusetts, California and Nevada -- that legalized marijuana last month. Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington previously legalized the drug. Marijuana use remains illegal under an unenforced federal law.
Maine legalized marijuana for medical use in 1999.
Now that the recounts have been dropped, Gov. Paul LePage is expected to issue proclamations certifying the results. Both measures then will take effect in January, but implementing both -- as well as other referendums that passed last month -- is expected to take months.
Voters on Election Day also approved referendums to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020, institute ranked-choice voting and spend more money on transportation projects. A measure that would have adopted stricter rules on gun sales was defeated.

Getting law on the side of fighting invasives

Texto completo:   I nvasive plants became invasive because people -- homeowners or government workers -- believed they served a useful purpose, and they deliberately planted them. The plants may have been selected for their looks or their ability to control erosion or grow fast and thus provide screening.
At the time, no one realized these plants lacked natural controls in their new regions, so would spread unmitigated. Now, decades later, the state government is stepping in to ban the propagation, sale, purchase, import or export of any plant deemed invasive, "likely invasive" or "potentially invasive" in Maine.
When the invasive-plant ban is approved -- and it is expected to be, perhaps as early as the end of January -- it will be long overdue. Maine is now the only New England state without some controls on terrestrial (growing in the ground) invasive plants.
At a recent Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry public hearing in Augusta on the proposed regulations, the half dozen people who testified -- mostly landscapers and environmentalists -- all supported the general idea, but they questioned some of the specifics.
Two things surprised me about the proposed regulations and the hearing itself: the number of plants on the list, which ran to 33 species (and with cultivars, varieties and hybrids is even longer) and the potential for the list to grow; with warming temperatures, more plants will have to be added.
Banning the sale of invasive plants is a good step, but to be effective it must be coupled with efforts to remove the invasive plants that are already taking
over Maine's forests and fields. Eradication, if it is even possible, will take a lot of time and money.
"What happened with invasive plants is that people were looking for simple solutions to complex problems," Bob Bittenbender said at the hearing. Though his business card identifies him as a "curmudgeon environmentalist," he has worked as groundskeeper for Maine Audubon Society's Gilsland Farm in Falmouth, and he volunteers to document invasive plants in public spaces in Portland.
Often the people looking for those simple solutions were government employees, Bittenbender added, which prompted State Horticulturist Gary Fish, who chaired the hearing, to display posters the government printed decades ago that urge the use of the very plants now considered invasive.
Several people in the audience admitted that they had planted or sold invasive plants, acts they now regret.
Gardeners liked these plants because they grow easily, require little maintenance and are difficult to kill -- all the reasons they now out-compete native plants. Wildlife, however, feels otherwise; Maine's wildlife co-evolved with Maine's native plants, which provide the food and shelter that make them healthiest. In addition, when a region loses its native ecosystems it loses its identity, the things that make its forests and fields look different from other places around the world.
Laura Zitske of Maine Audubon said invasive plant prohibitions are overdue and needed to prevent expense and work for foresters and farmers. The berries from such plants, she said, provide less nutrition for birds and other animals than native berries and are often diuretics, which don't do the animals any good, either. The proposed rules might also "save stubborn people such as myself from blood, sweat and tears as they work to remove such species as Asiatic bittersweet from their own property."
Some people worried that certain plants were left off the state's prohibition list, while other plants didn't belong there.
Swallow-wort, for one, is not on the list, though it is widely considered an invasive plant. But swallow-wort was introduced to Maine accidentally and has never been propagated or sold, so banning its sale or propagation is unnecessary.
Bittenbender cited several other plants he sees taking over public lands in Portland that are absent from the list. Littleleaf linden was planted along Baxter Boulevard, and he says it is spreading around Back Cove. Privet is rampant in the Riverside trolley park area. The callery pear is taking over a slope by East End School. Japanese tree lilacs are spreading. European mountain ash grows on its own in a lot of city parks, and while it might not be invasive now, when the climate gets warmer it could be.
Rugosa rose, the beach rose so common along the Maine coast, elicited some back and forth. Bittenbender argued for its inclusion on the banned list, saying it is in many state parks and spreads much faster than other roses. But Jeff O'Donal, of O'Donal's Nursery in Gorham, countered that the rugosa is a good colonizing plant, which means that while it will spread in an area, it won't jump great distances. Also, it requires sandy soil and full sun to grow. For those reasons, he does not consider it invasive.
He also requested an exception to the ban on all Euonymus alatus cultivars because, he said, several scientific studies offer sound evidence that 'Rudy Haag,' a cultivar that O'Donal propagates and sells, does not produce viable seeds.
Mark Faunce, a past president of the Maine Landscape and Nursery Association and an employee at a wholesale plant company, testified that he would like the regulations rewritten to reflect regional differences. He argued that plants that are invasive in the growing zone around Kittery would not be invasive, and could even be a staple, of the industry in Fort Kent.
As written, the proposed regulations give nurseries one year after they take effect to continue to sell any plants on the list. O'Donal and Faunce called for that transition time to be extended to three years, as has been done in other states adopting invasive-plant lists, because plants propagated now will not be ready for sale within a year -- and the nurseries stand to lose a lot of money.
After the hearing, Fish said the Invasive Terrestrial Plants Committee that developed the regulations will review the testimony and consider possible changes.
If it makes no changes, it could vote immediately and the regulations would take effect 30 days later. Changes, of course, would delay the timetable.
I have followed the debate on invasive plants for 20 years, and I am glad that Maine is joining the responsible horticultural world and adopting a list. I've never heard of some of the plants on the list. Others, like multiflora rose, bittersweet and bishop's weed (which a friend calls "the pernicious weed"), I battle regularly.

Texto completo:   It doesn't matter how many articles of clothing Phelan Moonsong puts on before walking out the door each day: If he's not wearing his favorite pair of goat horns, the pagan priest might as well be naked.
Unless the 56-year-old Millinocket, Maine, man is sleeping or bathing, his beloved horns are rarely far from his scalp.
It has been that way since he first laid eyes on the horns at a pagan men's group gathering in 2009. A friend whose goat had recently died offered the horns to group members. Nobody else wanted the dead goat's hardware; Moonsong couldn't believe his luck.
So he took the horns home, drilled small holes in each one and attached them to his forehead using stretchy, 50-pound fishing line that he wrapped around his head like an invisible skull cap.
His life was never the same.
"As a practicing pagan minister and a priest of Pan, I've come to feel very attached to the horns, and they've become a part of me and part of my spirituality," Moonsong said, noting that he periodically soaks the horns in patchouli and cedar oil to keep them fresh and leathery. "The horns are part of my religious attire."
Moonsong feels so attached to his horns that he refuses to take them off for anyone - including the state of Maine. In August, Moonsong said, officials at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles in Bangor told him that he would need to remove the horns to receive state-issued identification.
When he tried to explain to bureau employees that he is a priest of Pan - one who considers the horns his "spiritual antenna" - they were not moved. They told him that the horns would have to be approved by Maine's secretary of state.
"She told me that I had to send in some documentation or religious text to show why it was required for me to have my horns on," Moonsong said. "I said, 'Okay, I'll go ahead and do that,' but it seemed like an onerous requirement."
Moonsong said he sent the state a personal essay explaining the importance of his horns, along with four scholarly works, including one titled "Pagan Religions: A Handbook for Diversity Training."
Though he didn't realize it at the time, Moonsong had joined a religious-freedom battle that is being fought in DMV offices around the country.
At least 30 states offer residents high levels of constitutional protection for religious expression, some of them even higher than the protection offered by the Constitution's First Amendment, according to Charles Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center of the Newseum Institute.
"Generally speaking, even in states without a high level of protection, officials have to have a pretty good reason for saying no to a religious accommodation for a driver's license photo," Haynes said. "How strong that reason needs to be depends on where you live."
But it also depends on the quality of the citizen's case, Haynes said. When people argue for the right to cover their faces in a driver's license photo - such as a Muslim woman who believes it's immodest to uncover her face - states often have the upper hand because it's in the interest of the state to assist police in being able to identify people.
"However," Haynes added, "if the person's religious garb doesn't cover the face or obstruct law enforcement, those folks are likely to win."
The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of a Christian woman who accuses DMV officials of discriminating against her by refusing to make a religious accommodation. Yvonne Allen says she was forced to remove her headscarf - which she wears for religious reasons - to have a photo taken for her driver's license, according to the complaint.
"When Ms. Allen explained her religious beliefs," the complaint states, "the county officials responded with a remarkable claim: They admitted that there was a religious accommodation available for head coverings, but contended that it applied only to Muslims."
"They also ridiculed Ms. Allen's sincerely held religious beliefs, with the Chief Clerk informing her that she was herself a Christian and did not cover her head," the complaint adds. "Left with no choice if she wished to renew her license, Ms. Allen - with tears in her eyes and feeling sick to her stomach over the violation of her religious beliefs - removed her head covering."
Heather L. Weaver, senior staff attorney for the ACLU's Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, said DMV offices sometimes rule in favor of one faith and against another not because of bigotry so much as ignorance.
"Sometimes it comes down to them not understanding certain faiths," Weaver said. "That's when we come in to educate DMV officials about particular religious headgear and explain that something is a legitimate religious belief that should be accommodated in the same way you might accommodate a Jewish yarmulke."
Allen's case is ongoing, but Moonsong said he avoided hiring a lawyer and filing a lawsuit.
After several months of waiting to hear from the state's motor vehicle office following his initial visit, he says he informed the bureau that he was in touch with the ACLU. His ID arrived in the mail days later, he says.
A spokeswoman for the Maine secretary of state told the Bangor Daily News that Moonsong had not mentioned that the horns were religious in nature during his initial visit to the motor vehicle office.
"He did not cite religious reasons," said the spokeswoman, Kristen Muszynski. "There are exceptions for religious headdress."
The newspaper reported that Maine follows American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators guidelines, which state that license photos "may only show the cardholder with headgear, if the cardholder is a member of a religion requiring the wearing thereof and provided that the headgear does not present as an obstruction or present a shadow and render the portrait inadequate for the identification of the cardholder."
Moonsong, who changed his name earlier this year, said he was "elated" with the result of his battle - not only for himself, but for others who quietly share some of his beliefs.
"A lot of pagans are in the closet and - as with the LGBT crowd - there's a lot of misconceptions and discrimination that they face," he said.
"Many practicing pagans are afraid of being public," Moonsong added, "but when they see my horns it reminds them it's okay to be yourself."
There are personal benefits to having an ID as well, he noted. Although he doesn't drive, Moonsong will finally be able to use his ID to board a plane to California, where some of the best pagan festivals are found.
"I'm very excited," he said.

Texto completo: CONCORD, N.H. - Low temperatures and high winds have put the Northeastern U.S. in a deep freeze.
Dangerous wind chills of 20 to 30 below in parts of the region made for some crippling conditions Friday.
"You are talking about 30 degrees below normal highs. That is pretty darn cold," said National Weather Service meteorologist James Brown in Maine. "This is pretty much a piece of arctic air that came off the North Pole and came into New England."
Forecasters said a storm will follow the frigid weather, bringing chances for snow, sleet and freezing rain across much of the country.
Some schools closed early Thursday, and many others delayed opening Friday to avoid a bone-chilling wait at the bus stop.
"We're not strangers to these sorts of bitter temperatures on Mount Washington's summit," senior weather observer Mike Carmon said in the weather observatory's blog at the highest peak in the Northeast. "However, over the last few winters, it's generally late January or February before we experience this sort of polar air outbreak."
The wind chill was down to 85 below at the summit early Friday.
Utility workers were prepared for power outages due to fallen trees. David Flener, field safety manager at Eversource, New Hampshire's largest utility, said workers are well-educated on how to stay warm in the coldest weather, starting before they even arrive on a job site.
In upstate New York, along the Lake Ontario shore, wind gusts approached 70mph and the National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning effective through early Friday morning. Lake-effect snow was accompanied by winds of up to 50mph, causing whiteout conditions in some places.
In suburban Syracuse, a woman's body and vehicle were found in a creek, apparently after a crash during whiteout conditions.
Authorities say the body of 50-year-old Daphne Washburn, of Liverpool, was found under ice in 4feet of water at Onondaga Lake Park, along with her partially submerged SUV, on Thursday night.
Elsewhere in New York, parts of the Adirondack Northway, north of Albany, were closed for more than four hours after a crash involving a tractor-trailer and a snowplow. No injuries were reported.
In western Pennsylvania, lake-effect snow bands were blamed for slick roads and poor visibility. Fifty-nine vehicles crashed in a snowy pileup, and three people were hurt. The crash was one of three that shut down stretches of Interstate 80.
Park officials in one Massachusetts town decided it was too cold to open an outdoor ice rink. The Worcester Common Oval was to open Friday night for public skating.
Below-normal temperatures are expected this weekend and into Monday across the northern half of the country, from the Pacific Northwest to Maine and as far south as Oklahoma, Arkansas and Virginia, according to the Climate Prediction Center.
In Oklahoma, authorities said three people died in separate wrecks and more than 100 traffic crashes were reported after freezing drizzle slickened roads in the Oklahoma City area.

A 20 year-toll: More than 300 gymnasts abused

Texto completo: INDIANAPOLIS — A 12-year-old gymnast molested by an Olympic coach during "therapy" sessions.
Children as young as 6 secretly photographed nude by coaches.
Coaches who slipped a finger inside girls' leotards.
A coach having almost daily sex with a 14-year-old at one of the country's most prestigious gyms.
No one knows exactly how many children have been sexually exploited in America's gyms over the past 20 years. But an IndyStar-USA TODAY Network review of hundreds of police files and court cases across the country provides for the first time a measure of just how pervasive the problem is.
At least 368 gymnasts have alleged some form of sexual abuse at the hands of their coaches, gym owners and other adults working in gymnastics. That's a rate of one every 20 days.
IndyStar previously reported that top officials at USA Gymnastics, one of the nation's most prominent Olympic organizations, failed to alert police to many allegations of sexual abuse that occurred on their watch. But the problem is far worse. A nine-month investigation into cases across the nation has found that predatory coaches were allowed to move from gym to gym, undetected by a lax system of oversight, or dangerously passed on by USA Gymnastics-certified gyms.
USA Gymnastics calls itself a leader in child safety. In a statement responding to IndyStar's questions, it said: "Nothing is more important to USA Gymnastics, the Board of Directors and CEO Steve Penny than protecting athletes, which requires sustained vigilance by everyone — coaches, athletes, parents, administrators and officials. We are saddened when any athlete has been harmed in the course of his or her gymnastics career."
The organization noted several initiatives, including the use of criminal background checks for coaches, the practice of publishing the names of coaches banned from its competitions and programs that provide educational materials to member gyms.
But IndyStar's investigation found:
USA Gymnastics focuses its efforts to stop sexual abuse on educating members instead of setting strict ground rules and enforcing them. It says it can't take aggressive action because member gyms are independent businesses and because of restrictions in federal law pertaining to Olympic organizations. Both are contentions others dispute.
Gym owners have a conflict of interest when it comes to reporting abuse. Some fear harm to their business. When confronted with evidence of abuse, many quietly have fired the suspected abusers and failed to warn future employers. Some of those coaches continued to work with children.
Some coaches are fired from gym after gym without being tracked or flagged by USA Gymnastics, or without losing their membership. The organization often has no idea when a coach is fired by a gym and no systematic way to keep track. Ray Adams was fired or forced to resign from at least six gyms in four states. Yet some gym owners hired Adams, believing his record was clean.
Though the vast majority of officials put children's well-being ahead of business and competition, there are some at every level who have not. Some coaches suspected of abuse kept their jobs as long as they accepted special monitoring. Others were allowed to finish their season before being fired. In 2009, Doug Boger was named Coach of the Year and was sent to international competition while under investigation for sexual abuse.
Victims' stories have been treated with skepticism by USA Gymnastics officials, gym owners, coaches and parents. Former gymnasts Charmaine Carnes and Jennifer Sey said they felt pressured by Penny not to pursue allegations of abuse by prominent coaches Don Peters and Boger. Carnes said she thought Penny tried to keep the claims about Boger quiet for as long as possible to protect the sport's image and win championships, a characterization that USA Gymnastics disputes.
In its statement to IndyStar, USA Gymnastics said it is constantly striving to improve.
In the wake of IndyStar's August investigation, USA Gymnastics hired a former prosecutor to evaluate its bylaws and offer advice on how to strengthen its policies. It also established a policy review panel on its board of directors. And it said it will play a central role in developing a U.S. Center for SafeSport to oversee education programs and investigate and adjudicate claims of sexual misconduct for all U.S. Olympic Committee governing bodies.
"USA Gymnastics is proud of the work it has done to address and guard against child sexual abuse," it said in background materials provided to IndyStar.
Penny, who has been president since 2005, declined to be interviewed for this and other IndyStar stories. Neither the chairman of USA Gymnastics' board, Paul Parilla, nor board members responded to interview requests.
Many who want reforms in Olympic sports said they are frustrated by the lack of meaningful reform.
"It saddens me because I love our sport," said Molly Shawen-Kollmann, a former member of the U.S. national team and current coach in the Cincinnati area. "This is not indicative of who we want to be. As an organization, they aren't doing their job."
Evidence of the hundreds of gymnasts exploited by their coaches over the years is buried in court documents and police reports across the nation. Often the children are mentioned by their initials or identified as "Victim 1."
To tally the number of potential victims, IndyStar reporters scoured two decades of news stories and thousands of pages of public records.
Reporters also interviewed more than 100 people, including gym owners, athletes, coaches, police officers, prosecutors and child advocates, as well as athletes who came forward after the newspaper's original investigation in August.
All told, these gymnasts named 115 adults at every level of the sport, from respected Olympic mentors to novices working with recreational gymnasts. The alleged abuse happened in every part of the U.S. — from Maine to California, Washington to Florida, and across the Midwest.
The victims included casual athletes and elite-level performers such as Olympians. They were teenagers and preteens. The youngest was 6. Almost all of them were girls.
They encountered the men accused of abusing them everywhere from a Rhode Island YMCA to the famous Karolyi Ranch in Texas, where USA Gymnastics sends its top female athletes to train.
It's unclear how many of the alleged victims and coaches were USA Gymnastics members, because the organization does not disclose that information.
Former coach Jeffrey Bettman, who pleaded guilty this year to child pornography charges, hid cameras in changing rooms in gyms in California and Oregon over the course of a decade. William McCabe pleaded guilty in 2006 to doing the same thing in his Georgia gym.
USA Gymnastics member Kenneth Arnold, 28, was arrested in November in Zionsville, Ind. Arnold, who has pleaded not guilty, is accused of pulling back the leotards of two gymnasts and touching their genitals while assisting them with moves.
The charges came 18 months after the gym owner issued Arnold a warning about setting boundaries with gymnasts, writing in an e-mail: "No holding, hugging, touching athletes to tell them to tighten up. No tickling or carrying kids on back."
And just last week, police arrested Joseph Hannon, 21, on charges of predatory criminal sexual contact with a 9-year-old girl at a USA Gymnastics member gym in Sycamore, Ill. Police said Hannon, whose attorney says he plans enter a not guilty plea to the charge, was on probation for a felony drug offense when he allegedly abused the girl.
In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it did not know how many children have alleged sexual abuse against its members.
"We find it appalling that anyone would exploit a young athlete or child in this manner, and recognize the effect this behavior can have on a person's life. USA Gymnastics has been proactive in helping educate gymnastics community and will continue to take every punitive action available within our jurisdiction and cooperate fully with law enforcement."

Texto completo: Junior guard Nahjor Mack scored 18 points Friday night to lead Elmira High School to a 64-34 win over visiting Union-Endicott in Southern Tier Athletic Conference boys basketball action.
Jerick Guinta added 10 points and Dan Fedor scored eight for the Express (3-2, 3-1 STAC). Elmira went on a 21-8 run over the second quarter to build a 31-16 halftime advantage.
"We were good defensively," Elmira head coach Ryan Johnson said. "We've got some things to fix. We've got to be more consistent on both ends of the floor. It was an ugly win. It's always nice to win ugly, but we've got some work to do."
Elmira plays at Horseheads on Tuesday night at Horseheads Middle School.
Luke Meier led Union-Endicott with 12 points.
Corning 79, Vestal 36: Jalen Nuckles scored 23 points as Corning rolled past visiting Vestal in STAC action for its second consecutive victory.
The Hawks, coming off an overtime win over Horseheads on Tuesday, led 48-13 at halftime behind 19 points from Nuckles.

Notre Dame led 21-10 after the first quarter. The Senecas (0-4) closed within 29-23 at the half before Notre Dame added to its lead with an 18-12 third quarter.
"We talk about trying to get off to a good start in both the first and third quarters. We did that tonight," Notre Dame head coach Bill Hopkins said.
"We made five threes in the first quarter. Sometimes you get three-point happy, so we weren't able to sustain much in the second quarter. In the third quarter, Ben Cook had six points to kind of lead us. He established himself inside."
Max Schimizzi led Watkins Glen with 15 points. Connor Seeley-Ion added 13 points.
Waverly 81, Edison 65: Hunter Bodine scored 27 points as Waverly pulled away from host Thomas A. Edison in the third quarter after leading their IAC contest by four at intermission.

Tioga 59, O-M 43: A 19-2 first quarter helped send Tioga to an IAC victory over host Odessa-Montour.
Nick Klossner paced the Tigers (3-2) with 24 points.

Olivia Grover led O-M (6-1) with 10 rebounds. Alexis Saunders contributed seven points and five steals off the bench.
Boys swimming Maine-Endwell 96, Horseheads 82: Shoonhsin Li won the 100-yard butterfly (53.51) and 100 breaststroke (1:04.0) as the Blue Raiders lost an away meet against unbeaten Maine-Endwell (5-0).

Elmira teams that earned the honor were boys cross country, girls cross country, golf, girls volleyball, boys soccer, girls soccer, girls swimming and diving, and girls tennis. Teams with a combined academic average of 90 or better from at least 75 percent of their rosters were honored.

Texto completo: Delta will add one more roundtrip to Detroit from Greater Binghamton Regional Airport starting March 1.
Another Delta flight will be a welcome addition to the airline-starved travelers hoping to catch flights from the local airport.
The addition will increase the number of daily flights to and from the Town of Maine airfield to six —three arrivals and three departures.
United abandoned its Binghamton-to-Newark route in late November, and American is scheduled to end its daily service — two roundtrip flights — to Philadelphia on Feb. 15.
Based on the posted schedule, Delta now has flights departing Binghamton for Detroit at 5:55 a.m. and 5:42 p.m. Arrivals from Detroit are scheduled for 5:17 p.m. and 11:28 p.m.
On March 1, the departures will be scheduled at 5:55 a.m., 1:14 p.m. and 5:05 p.m.; arrivals at 12:49 p.m.; 4:40 p.m. and 11:20 p.m.
All service in Binghamton will be provided by a 50-passenger regional jet. Flight time between Detroit and Binghamton is about an hour, 20 minutes.
In Elmira, Delta has five Delta daily arrivals and departures plus Allegiant service to St. Petersburg/Clearwater twice weekly and Sanford/Orlando twice weekly.
Ithaca has maintained its service from United to Newark, three flights daily, American to Philadelphia, three flights daily, and Delta to Detroit, three flights daily.

Support for legal pot grows in N.H.

Resumen: Simon said his organization would favor measures including allowing users to grow small numbers of plants for personal use, as well as the state starting to develop a legal market for marijuana where it could regulate and tax sales of the drug. In Colorado, state government has collected over $150 million in tax revenue from legal marijuana sales, a portion of which goes toward school construction projects. Simon said he thinks legalization will probably face steep odds this year, but he added it's time for lawmakers to start talking about it.

Texto completo: Monitor staff
The push for legal marijuana in New Hampshire just got a high-profile backer.
N.H. Senate Minority Leader Jeff Woodburn, a Democrat from Dalton, said he plans to propose legislation with a firm date to legalize recreational marijuana use in the state.
Woodburn said he believes New Hampshire residents are ready for legal pot, adding that recent legalization in neighboring Maine and Massachusetts should motivate lawmakers here to take action.
Canada could also be poised to legalize the drug nationwide. Canada's government is expected to draft legalization legislation next year.
“I think they have forced us to look at our laws and regulations,” Woodburn said. “What we can't control is what's happening all around us. We can't put our heads in the snow.”
Even if a bill was passed this year, Woodburn said he would likely push the date for legal marijuana a few years down the road, until 2019 or 2020.
“You get a goal,” he said. “It's like D-Day; we're going to invade on this date.”
Woodburn coming out in favor of the issue gives legalization a high-profile boost in the New Hampshire Senate, the place where it has been stymied in past legislative sessions.
“I'm very, very pleased with Sen. Woodburn's decision to show leadership on the legalization issue,” said Matt Simon, New England political director of the Marijuana Policy Project. “It's an issue that people are looking for leadership on, and there's not been a lot of leadership in the senate.”
Marijuana legalization narrowly passed the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2014 but faced stiff opposition in the senate.
Gov. Maggie Hassan was opposed to legalization, and Gov.-elect Chris Sununu has signaled he would take a similar stance.
Sununu said in a recent Portsmouth Herald interview that he wants to wait to see how neighboring states implement legalization before New Hampshire wades into the fray.
However, Sununu has also said he would support marijuana decriminalization in the state, which lawmakers and advocates say has a decent shot at passing in the upcoming legislative session.
Woodburn said one of the reasons the issue of legalization resonates strongly with him is his background as a high school teacher, and seeing some of his students' lives disrupted from minor drug convictions involving marijuana.
The senator said there's now a critical mass of people in New Hampshire who favor legalization, and their wishes should be listened to.
A WMUR/Granite State Poll conducted in March found 62 percent of adults in New Hampshire support legalization.
“We're seeing frustrated citizens – the vast majority want legalization,” he said.
He said he will be looking closely at how legalization plays out in Maine and Massachusetts.
Simon said his organization would favor measures including allowing users to grow small numbers of plants for personal use, as well as the state starting to develop a legal market for marijuana where it could regulate and tax sales of the drug.
In Colorado, state government has collected over $150 million in tax revenue from legal marijuana sales, a portion of which goes toward school construction projects.
A similar proposal was put forward by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Marchand in the primary this fall.
Marchand estimated regulating and taxing legal marijuana would generate about $30 million worth of revenue to put in the state's coffers.
Simon said he thinks legalization will probably face steep odds this year, but he added it's time for lawmakers to start talking about it.
“The sooner we get rolling on this, the better,” he said. “It's not enough to say, ‘We have an opioid crisis, we're not going to talk about marijuana.' ”

Resumen: According to meteorologist Nikki Becker, of the National Weather Service, the temperature all across Maine fell to an usually frigid level Thursday night and Friday morning. Mark Turner, director of public works in Waterville, said his department hadn't had to respond to any cold weather-related calls, but it was preparing for the upcoming snowfall.

Texto completo:   Factoring wind chill, NWS says temperature dipped to minus 28 on Friday
WATERVILLE -- Even as the temperature plummeted to negative numbers Friday, police and fire officials said it was business as usual during the day.
Waterville police Deputy Chief William Bonney said they hadn't received any specific calls about the bitterly cold weather. He said typically two or three times a winter, they will encounter someone "outside and unable to take care of themselves," in which case they either bring the person home, to the hospital or to the Mid-Maine Homeless Shelter.
Representatives from the shelter were not available for comment on how busy the shelter was Thursday night into Friday. Bonney said if a person has nowhere to go, the police will "do everything we can to get them some place warm."
"It's not something that happens every time it gets cold," he said.
According to meteorologist Nikki Becker, of the National Weather Service, the temperature all across Maine fell to an usually frigid level Thursday night and Friday morning. Becker said factoring in wind chill, the low in Waterville was minus 32 degrees Fahrenheit. In Augusta, the low was minus 28 degrees, and in Lewiston it was minus 27 degrees. Becker said without considering wind chill, the low temperature in Waterville was minus 8 degrees.
Fire Department Lt. Scott Holst said aside from a few broken water pipes in residences, there hadn't been any weather-related problems for the department to respond to. The most common emergency services provided on days like Friday, Holst said, are helping people who either have slipped and fallen or have respiratory problems after being outside too long.
"We've been quiet," Holst said.
Following the cold weather, Becker said, will be a snowfall of 4 to 6 inches today. Over the course of the day, she said, that will transition to a "wintery mix" before turning to rain Sunday. The temperature then is expected to rise again.
The cold also presented problems for drivers across New England. Pat Moody, the spokesperson for AAA, said the Northern New England branch of the travel organization, which covers Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, had responded to 3,000 calls. On a typical winter day, he said Northern New England staffers might respond to 1,800 calls. He projected that by the end of the day, AAA would have responded to "double or triple" the usual number of calls.
"It's been a busy day," Moody said.
The most common call AAA received Friday involved batteries. Moody said a battery loses about 60 percent of its starting power when the temperature drops below zero. Most of the calls were from drivers needing their batteries either jumped or replaced; and in metropolitan areas, Moody said, AAA drivers offer a battery replacement service. A battery lasts three to five years, and Moody said AAA recommends that anyone who has difficulty starting a vehicle in the cold see if its battery needs to be replaced.
Moody said AAA staffers also have been responding to a lot of calls about tire pressure. For every 10-degree drop in temperature, Moody said, a tire will lose about a pound of pressure. He said in most cases this is not usually an emergency situation, but a number of customers called after seeing their air pressure gauge in their car activate.
"When it gets this cold, all components of the car have to work harder," Moody said.
Despite the harsh elements, virtually all the lights in the area remained on. Gail Rice, a Central Maine Power Co. spokeswoman, said the company hadn't received many calls about power outages in the Waterville area. It did have a problem farther north in the state, where thousands of customers lost power after a tree fell on a transformer.
Mark Turner, director of public works in Waterville, said his department hadn't had to respond to any cold weather-related calls, but it was preparing for the upcoming snowfall.
"We're just standing by for the first signs of snowfall and precipitation for tomorrow," Turner said. "It's been fairly quiet today. We're just getting ready for things."
Although Becker predicted a warm-up over the weekend, Turner said with all the cold weather, it would be difficult for the warmer air to have a big effect. He said that could mean a long night for Public Works, especially if the precipitation continues through the night.
"If it continues and turns to rain with cold temperatures, it could get pretty difficult for slippery roads and icy conditions," he said.
The winter weather also will affect holiday events in downtown Waterville. Kringleville, a long-standing tradition in which families can meet Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus, is canceled for today because of the expected storm. Kringleville will resume its regular business hours Sunday, from 1 to 5 p.m.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- When Courtney Carrier showed up for her Saturday morning waitressing gig at Dysart's on Broadway, she never dreamed she'd be getting what likely was her biggest tip ever -- a crisp $100 bill, a pair of stuffed elves and a Santa hat to brighten the rest of her day.
"It was a big surprise," Carrier said. "I'm very, very, very thankful for it, too, so it was pretty cool. I'll probably just save it. My boyfriend and I are planning to go to Florida in February."
Carrier was among the first to get "elfed" by members of the Bangor Elves, an anonymous group that each December since 2010 has been popping up at local restaurants, laundromats, nursing homes, sidewalks and other places, doling out thousands in cash, gift cards and other items in Bangor and more recently, Brewer.
Saturday was the group's "Day of Good Deeds" and Carrier was one of the first to be a beneficiary of a good deed. A former Calais resident now living and working in Bangor, she's been accepted for the spring semester at the University of Maine at Augusta's Bangor campus.
Later in the morning, other elves showed up at Pickering Square, where they set up several tables in a covered but open area along the front of the parking garage.
The tables were laden with warm clothing and blankets, food and drinks, toiletries and many other items for anyone who needed them. The elves even provide totebags so that the people who turned out had a way to bring their hauls home.
Bangor resident Nicole Roberts was happy to find them there.
"Actually, I just saw them setting up so I thought I'd just come down," she said. "What I do is take a bunch of socks and warm gloves and something and I may know someone who doesn't have it so I pass it on, which is cool, because 'Help thy Neighbor,' you know?"
It's the kind of generosity Roberts rarely saw before moving to Maine from New Jersey about 13 years ago.
"You don't get stuff like this. I wouldn't say never, but it's rare. You would really have to know the resources, where to get it, from where I'm at in Jersey, so stuff like this is a godsend," she said.
The head elf, who did not want to be identified, said the giving goes beyond the "Day of Good Deeds." The elves has provided wood, heating fuel and other necessities.
Recently, the elves covered the cost of a couple of weeks stay at a local hotel for a Brewer family. Both parents lost their jobs and the family was evicted. They are currently working on finding other housing but that takes time, the head elf said.
"In the meantime, they literally had no place to stay. I had people calling saying, 'It's getting cold outside. What are we going to do about them?'"
The Christmas cheer spread by the group is appreciated.
"The Bangor Elves made my day today at Ross Manor," one fan posted on the group's Facebook page after members dropped by for some caroling. "Thank you so much for your Christmas spirit."
A woman who was "elfed" at a local laundromat was thrilled to receive a stuffed elf and a $10 roll of quarters: "U all r fantastic!!!! U absolutely made my day! Merry Christmas'"

Texto completo:   As we finish 2016, our thoughts at the BDN turn to the interesting people we met throughout the year. It's been our privilege to share the snapshots of their lives, whether uplifting, tragic or surreal, with our readers.
Yet we know the story doesn't end with our telling, and in fact, the story often changes greatly after we've told it. This makes "Whatever happened to " a common refrain not only in our newsroom, but we expect, among the public as well.
That's why, at the end of this year, we wanted to find out "whatever happened." For the next few weeks, we'll be touching base with several Mainers whose stories came to attention during the year. What we found may sadden, delight, or surprise. In all cases, we hope you enjoy them. You can read more of their stories here.
" Anthony Ronzio, Editor, BDN
PORTLAND, Maine -- Four nights a week, Nadir Alzoubi walks to an Old Port restaurant to scrub dishes.
It's a familiar routine that stands in stark contrast to the chaos that led him here. As of Monday, it has been four years since Alzoubi and his then-pregnant wife Jamila fled Syria, looking for a safe place for their third child to be born. They had a fourth kid while struggling to get enough to eat in Jordan and in July were among the first Syrian refugees to be resettled in Maine since the outbreak of the county's civil war.
Four months into their new life in Portland, the family is beginning to settle into a predictable routine, despite the divisive politics of immigration in America.
Since the American election, friends have told Alzoubi not to worry about President-elect Donald Trump, who called Syrian refugees a " Trojan horse" during the campaign.
And he isn't worried. Rather, Alzoubi has a prayer for the next president: He hopes Trump will help other Syrians escape the tyranny of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, a prospect that has becoming increasingly unlikely as Syrian and Russian forces route the remaining rebel strongholds.
"The Syrian children and the Syrian women and the elders of Syria are asking [Trump] to help them and stand with them against this ungodly system," Alzoubi said.
But in a few short months, Alzoubi also has become aware of the fraught politics around immigration in America. He's glad he quickly found work -- mostly because it supplements the government aid his family receives and will help them more quickly rebuild their lives. But also because it bucks stereotypes about refugees that have festered and fed off a steady stream of anti-immigrant rhetoric from Trump and Gov. Paul LePage.
"The Syrians love work and activity [and] do not like laziness," Alzoubi said, translating Arabic words on his smartphone to supplement his impressionistic English, "and love to [make] friends and get to know all of the people."
Facing the many challenges of building a new life in a strange country, Alzoubi marveled at the generosity of his "friends" -- the word he uses for everyone who has lent his family aid.
The workers at Catholic Charities who helped the Alzoubis get government financial support, find a home, enroll their two older children in school and sign up for adult English classes are friends. A friends gave them a computer with the language program Rosetta Stone. Others donated many of the children's toys in the family's modest, East End apartment. And on a bright afternoon just before Thanksgiving, they waited for their friend -- a caseworker -- to drive Jamila and the four children to get government IDs.
Waiting in their sunny living room, Jamila served semolina cake while the couple's 2-year-old son, Omar, sat in the safety of his father's lap and stared wide-eyed into the lens of a BDN photographer's camera.
Nadir urged his two older daughters to show off the English they are learning in school. But the girls were shy, and their murmurs had to compete with the sound of an Arabic-language news program coming from the TV.
After several minutes of listening to an anchorwoman talk over footage of tanks and a bombed out Syrian city, Alzoubi stood and switched the channel to a children's program.
"Always too much of that," he said.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- President-elect Donald Trump has provided few details about his education policy goals but has made it clear that he intends to make changes in wide swaths that would have significant ramifications in Maine.
Trump's plan for his first 100 days in office includes just a few sentences about education policy, but it repeats some of his campaign promises: expand school choice for students, end the Common Core Education Standards, invest in vocational and technical education and make college more affordable.
Trump's pick of billionaire Betsy DeVos as his education secretary blows a stiff wind behind those goals. DeVos has long been a strong supporter of a national voucher system that would allow families access to taxpayer dollars to send their kids to private, religious or charter schools.
A major fight looms between voucher advocates and those who fear such a system would dismantle the taxpayer-funded public school system. The outcome is by no means certain, but with Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, the implementation of conservative, free-market education policy is as likely now as it has been in decades.
So what about Maine?
School choice
The incoming Trump administration has allies in Maine when it comes to allowing parents to tap public education budgets to send their children to private schools.
Republican Gov. Paul LePage and mostly Republicans in the Legislature enacted a law allowing the first charter schools in Maine in 2011. Under the provisions of the bill, those charter schools are considered public.
In his 2013 state budget proposal, LePage tried to create a voucher system that would have allowed low-income students access to taxpayer funds to go to whatever school they chose, including private ones. Later that year the governor proposed a bill titled An Act to Expand School Choice for Maine Students, which ultimately failed. It would have lifted the 10-school limit on the number of charter schools in Maine, which is a proposal likely to be aired again this year, and allowed public funding to flow to private religious schools.
LePage also spearheaded legislation passed in 2013 that made it easier for students to transfer from one public school system to another.
Jim Rier, a former education commissioner under LePage, said he expects proposals this year from both sides of the school choice equation. On one hand, he expects a bill to restore the authority over district-to-district transfers fully to superintendents. He also foresees an attempt to lift the cap on charter schools.
The Maine Charter School Commission has already approved nine of the 10 schools allowed under current law. But Rier said an attempt by Trump to legislate school choice from the federal level might be met coldly in the states, especially those such as Maine, which has spent much of the past six years negotiating with the Obama administration over the state's right to exert more authority over education policy and oversight.
"A lot of people are not in favor of having the feds tell us what to do," Rier said.
Trump has said he will propose the School Choice and Education Opportunity Act within his first 100 days. It would "redirect" $20 billion in current education spending to encourage school choice. Trump states on his website that states that let students use public school dollars to attend private schools would be given preference in the grant process, which would put Maine at a disadvantage unless it changes its school choice laws.
A change in Maine's school choice laws will face staunch opposition from legislative Democrats, who control the Maine House and who just allied with the teachers union to campaign successfully for a referendum that imposes a surtax on income over $200,000 to funnel more state aid to public education.
The bulk of federal money that flows into Maine's public schools is for low-income or special-needs students, and there is the potential for a Trump presidency to alter that.
Common Core
Trump has made it clear that he intends to end the Common Core State Standards, which are guidelines for what K-12 students should know and be able to do in math and English language arts. More than 40 states have voluntarily adopted the standards, including Maine, which adopted the Common Core in 2011.
Maine has seen pushes against Common Core. A group called No Common Core Maine once tried unsuccessfully to put the issue to referendum, and in 2013 a panel began but never finished an assessment of the Common Core education standards in Maine.
It's unclear what Trump could do to end the Common Core because it was a state-level initiative adopted by legislatures, though some have speculated he could change or eliminate incentives in the federal Every Student Succeeds Act to disincentivize use of the Common Core.
What would that mean for Maine? The state has its own broader set of standards for eight content areas, known as the Maine Learning Results, which were implemented in 1997. The Common Core was incorporated into the Learning Results for the 2013-14 school year. Without the Common Core, the Maine Learning Results would still be in place.
College affordability
Trump has a stated goal of making college and technical schools more affordable, which is an initiative that already is being spearheaded by LePage. Tuition across the University of Maine system has been frozen for six consecutive years, making Maine the only state in the nation to reduce its inflation-adjusted tuition during the past five years. While the cost of Maine's public universities has remained flat, the national average cost of public higher education has increased 13 percent.
LePage has also chipped away at student debt by expanding Maine's educational opportunity tax credit, offering interest-free loans to students and providing tax credits to employers who help employees pay off student loans. Anything Trump can do to supplement those initiatives would likely be welcomed by lawmakers from both parties.
Local control
Trump and DeVos will walk a fine line when it comes to establishing federal education policy that enhances the educational opportunities for all students while maintaining fiercely defended state-level control that has existed in the public education sector for decades. While some of their initiatives will make sense across political boundaries, others such as school choice will only fuel a bitter debate that has been ongoing for years.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- Marcy Ouellette's been sworn at more often in her 20 years as a victim/witness advocate than she ever was as a police officer.
"We do a lot of listening," she said of the job recently. "We don't blame. We don't judge. We don't take offense."
Ouellette's last day on the job in the Penobscot County district attorney's office was Dec. 16. She has been a zealous advocate for all crime victims but has worked most often with the victims of domestic violence.
"She wasn't afraid to fight with prosecutors, including the district attorney, to make sure the victim's voice was heard," District Court Judge Michael Roberts, formerly the deputy district attorney for Penobscot County, said during Ouellette's retirement party on Dec. 2. "We always knew that when we had a domestic violence case in this office, the victim's point of view would be presented in the courtroom."
Born Marcella Mona Morin 65 years ago, she was raised on a farm in Madawaska, the 12th of 16 children. She did not plan a career in the criminal justice system, having graduated from the University of Maine with a degree in education. But her teaching career was cut short when her position was eliminated after one year at a school in Van Buren.
Ouellette and her husband, Dan, moved to greater Bangor in search of work.
"I saw an ad in the paper for a police dispatcher in Old Town," she said. "I said to myself, 'I wonder what they do?' I didn't know [police] scanners existed."
She quickly learned how to deal with people in crisis. After working in dispatch, she followed Amy McCrea, 60, who will take over Ouellette's position in the district attorney's office, onto the Old Town police force in the early 1980s. They were the first female officers in what was then a bustling mill town.
Ouellette spent most of her time as a police officer in the community. She started the first Drug Abuse Resistance Education program, or D.A.R.E., in town and gave safety tips to the residents of the elderly housing units. She won many awards for her work including, officer of the year, woman of the year and citizen of the year during her decade or so on the streets of Old Town.
"I took a break from police work for a while and started working here 20 1/2 years ago," she said. "It appealed to me because it was still part of the criminal justice system, which I enjoyed, but it was a different part in the system. I have enjoyed it. Not, that it's been easy. It's a hard job. It really is."
What makes the job so frustrating is the uncertain nature of the criminal justice system. Court dates are set, witnesses are subpoenaed, victims show up at the courthouse, and the case is continued until the next month. Some cases take two years to come to trial and be resolved. She also informs victims when their abusers have completed their sentences and are about to be released.
"The criminal justice system is not victim friendly," Ouellette said. "It really is not. Every month, we contact them about court dates to make sure they are still available but the case is delayed. They get so tired. For people to hurry up and wait, the anxiety that produces is constant. Some victims just want to put this behind them and move on, to move forward, to start healing and they can't do that until it's over.
"We just wish that the victims could be made whole again," she said. "They experience very traumatic events, and they will never be the same again. The system can't fix that. It can't make it better.
Over the past two decades, Ouellette has seen crimes of domestic violence become more serious and more violent.
"We have strangulation cases all the time now," she said. "And, there's so much we don't know about strangulation, about the long-term effects. We know it's not good."
One of the reasons for the increase of the severity of charges filed in those types of domestic violence cases is that in 2012, the Maine Legislature changed the law to elevate crimes involving strangulation that don't result in serious bodily harm from assault to aggravated assault, according to a previously published report. Assault is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison. Aggravated assault is a Class B felony, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Before the law was changed, prosecutors found it difficult to take strangulation into account as a factor in charging a defendant.
Ouellette was one of just under 60 victim/witness advocates in the state. Forty-nine work for county district attorneys' offices, three work for the Maine attorney general's office, primarily on homicide cases; two work for the U.S. attorney's office in the federal courts; three work for the Maine Department of Corrections; and one works for the Portland Police Department.
The county programs began in the early to mid-1980s. They went statewide in 1987 when the Legislature passed a law that encouraged counties "to hire, train and provide support staff to a qualified person or persons to carry out the victim and witness support program." Penobscot County has had a victim/witness advocate program since the mid-1980s, according to the current district attorney, R. Christopher Almy.
Ouellette and other victim/witness advocates become involved within 12 to 48 hours of an arrest depending on whether that arrest happens over a weekend or not. The advocate informs victims of the amount of bail being requested, the bail conditions, how the court process works and how to seek a more permanent protection from abuse order than the no contact provision set as a bail condition.
"Their lives can be turned upside down, but that doesn't mean [an incident is] a crime," Ouellette said. "Or, they may want the person to go to prison for the rest of their lives and that's not going to happen. The prosecutors have guidelines. Judges have sentencing guidelines. They have a responsibility.
And, sometimes victims don't want the person to go to jail," she added.
While Ouellette and other victim/witness advocates spend most of their time with the victims of crime, the witness part of the job involves assisting prosecutors during trial by communicating with witnesses about when they are expected to testify and helping them fill out paperwork so they are reimbursed for expenses such as mileage and, in some case, meals and lodging.
Carlene Engstrom had never worked in the Maine criminal justice system when she was hired to work in the Penobscot County district attorney's office.
"Marcy taught me the system here in Maine," Engstrom said at Ouellette's retirement party. "She set the bar high for the rest of us."

Texto completo:   Nick Derba, who has served as an assistant in the University of Maine baseball program the last three seasons, has been named interim head coach for the 2016-2017 season.
Derba steps in for Steve Trimper, who departs the program after 11 seasons to become head coach at Stetson University.
Trimper will be announced as Stetson's new head coach on Monday.
Derba was promoted to associate head coach last season. UMaine will conduct a national search after next season to identify its next head coach.
"I'm excited for the opportunity to be the head coach at Maine for the spring of 2017," said Derba. "From here on out, it's business as usual. Our goals do not change as we will continue to work and build a victorious path towards the America East championship. I appreciate the opportunity [athletic administrator] Karlton Creech has granted me and wish the best of luck to coach Trimper."
During his time in Orono, Trimper guided the Black Bears to a 309-292-2 record, winning two America East titles (2006, 2011) and was honored as the conference's coach of the year in 2013.
In the 2011 NCAA tournament, the Bears won a game in a regional for the first time since 2005, defeating 20th-ranked Florida International.
"As my family and I embark on a new opportunity at Stetson University, I want to take this opportunity to thank the many players, coaches and UMaine supporters that have made the past 11 years of my career truly remarkable," said Trimper.
"My wife Lisa and I have raised our family in this wonderful community and have built life-long friendships that we will always cherish. I would like to thank President (Susan) Hunter, athletic director Karlton Creech, the UMaine community and the entire athletic department for a positive, enriching experience in Black Bear Nation. Also, as difficult as it is to leave our current team that has worked so hard, I am extremely pleased that coach Derba will step in as the leader of Maine baseball and guide them to all the success the deserve. Maine will always remain a special place to my family and I."
Kreech was also appreciative of Trimper's contributions to the program.
"Over his 11 seasons at the University of Maine, coach Trimper guided the Black Bears to substantial accomplishments including a pair of NCAA regional appearances and over 300 wins," Creech said. "We are grateful for his contributions to our program and wish he and his family continued success in this new chapter in their lives."
Derba spent six years in the St. Louis Cardinals' system after the organization drafted him in the 30th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft following a career at Manhattan College, where he played for Trimper.
Derba advanced as high as the Triple-A level and was a member of the 2012 Texas League champion Springfield Cardinals.
Derba retired in 2012 to pursue a coaching career. He served as hitting coach for the Cape Cod League's Chatham Anglers before coming to Orono.

Texto completo:   SMITHFIELD, Rhode Island -- The University of Maine women's basketball team had made 25 3-point field goals in its last three games before Saturday afternoon's non-conference game at Bryant University.
It turns out it was just the beginning.
Coach Richard Barron's Black Bears came out firing from long distance and shot 54.8 percent from beyond the arc for the game to score a 77-52 win over the Bulldogs at the Chace Athletic Center.
The win was the third straight for UMaine, now 6-5 and headed to Florida for the University of Miami Holiday Tournament. The Black Bears play East Tennessee State at 3 p.m. Monday and either Miami or Coppin State on Tuesday.
The loss was the sixth in the last seven games for Bryant (4-6).
Senior guard Sigi Koizar led Maine to its highest scoring output of the season with 20 points, including the 1,400th of her career. Koizar made eight of her 14 field-goal attempts and also contributed five rebounds. Tanesha Sutton posted 12 points, six assists and six rebounds and Blanca Millan scored 11 points, including three 3-pointers.
Julie Brosseau added eight points for the Black Bears, including two 3-pointers, and UMaine also got a late boost from 6-foot-2 freshman Tihana Stojsavljevic, who scored seven points in eight minutes to help the Black Bears hold off a second-half Bryant comeback.
Sydney Holloway led Bryant of the Northeast Conference with 16 points while Alex Klein had 11 points and five rebounds.
UMaine, which connected on 12 of 22 3-point tries for the game, made nine of its 16 first-half attempts from beyond the arc to build a 45-25 lead -- nailing six 3-pointers in the first quarter alone en route to a 28-16 advantage.
"It was a great first half for us," Barron told Don Shields of Learfield. "We shot the ball very well, especially in that first quarter. Twenty-eight points is a lot of points in a quarter, and I'm very happy with that."
The Black Bears also induced 15 Bryant turnovers before the break and outscored the Bulldogs 25-0 on points off turnovers during the game's first 20 minutes.
Bryant held a 14-10 lead after a 3-pointer by Kierra Palmer with 4:44 left in the first quarter before UMaine used its long-range shooting to score 15 unanswered points and take the lead for good.
Koizar started the run with a layup before Sutton hit a 3-pointer to give Maine a 15-14 edge. Sutton then made a layup and Laia Sole converted a jumper before Millan and Naira Caceres each scored from beyond the arc to extend the Black Bears' cushion to 25-14 with 1:06 left in the opening period.
Haley Connors finally answered for Bryant with a layup, but Brosseau hit UMaine's sixth 3-pointer in the game's first 10 minutes to give the Black Bears their 12-point lead at the end of the period.
The UMaine run grew to 20-2 as Koizar went inside to score 19 seconds into the second period.
A Holloway layup kept Bryant within 32-22 midway through the second quarter before UMaine scored 13 unanswered points to take a 45-22 lead on a layup by Millan with 1:25 left in the half.
The 3-pointer also figured prominently in this run, with Brosseau, Millan and Koizar all connecting from beyond the arc.
A late 3-pointer by Chanel Ramcharren pulled Bryant within 20 by intermission.
UMaine couldn't maintain its 3-point volume after intermission, and Bryant gradually climbed back into the contest -- pulling within 58-48 on a 3-pointer by Stephanie Lesko with 7:56 left in the game.
"I was not happy with our energy coming out after halftime," said Barron. "We knew that this was a team that was going to play with pride and they came out and cut it to 10. They were on a big run and outscored us by seven in the third quarter. I was disappointed with our intensity and I thought they brought it, Bryant did."
But UMaine altered its lineup and regained control with 14 unanswered points.
First Koizar drove for a three-point play, then Brosseau hit a jumper to make it 63-48 before Stojsavljevic buried a 3-pointer and another jumper to extend UMaine's lead back to 20 at 68-48 with 5:03 left.
Koizar added two free throws and Sutton converted a layup to push UMaine's cushion to 72-48 with 3:58 remaining.
"We made some substitutions and I thought Tihana had obviously her best game," said Barron. "Even though she brought four fouls along with it she brought some intensity we were looking for. That inspired us and we ended up having a big fourth quarter.
"The kid's going to be special," added Barron of Stojsavljevic. "She's got a lot to learn and a lot to develop and we're going to be patient with her as she does it, but she really has a lot of upside."

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- The behind-the-scenes campaign for the Blaine House in 2018 has begun, with Republicans waiting to see if federal officeholders jump in, Democrats looking early at a potential insider-outsider race and independents mulling bids.
It's a race that could reshape Maine, with the term-limited Paul LePage leaving the governorship in 2019, eight years after taking office in a historic year for Republicans that set Democrats back after 40 years in which they largely controlled state government.
The LePage era has provided a deep Republican bench in Maine, but it's U.S. Sen. Susan Collins and U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin looming large over an otherwise less-known but capable field as perhaps the only people who could drive potential candidates in both parties from the race.
Democrats are a party in flux, with longtime lawmakers faring badly in Maine elections back to 2010. Attorney Adam Cote and Lee Auto Malls chairman Adam Lee could mount outsider campaigns against officeholders past and present, including Attorney General Janet Mills.
Plus, Maine's independent streak and a 2016 referendum passing ranked-choice voting could leave room for unenrolled candidates, with two-time gubernatorial hopeful Eliot Cutler cracking the door open to a run after vowing last year to not run again.
To examine the field, the Bangor Daily News contacted 24 people who have been named publicly as potential hopefuls or were named by sources, with 21 responding. Eight said they're considering bids, and eight gave neutral statements.
Republicans
Collins and Poliquin hold sway over the rest of their party for a few good reasons.
-- She polls as Maine's most popular politician, and he won re-election this year in the 2nd U.S. House District after becoming the first Republican to win that seat in 20 years.
-- They could win what they've lost before. Collins dropped the 1994 gubernatorial race to independent Angus King, while Poliquin finished sixth out of seven in the 2010 Republican primary.
-- If they leave their seats, it would set off a scramble for other accessible offices.
But both are being coy. In a statement, Collins spokeswoman Annie Clark noted that "many Mainers" have encouraged the senator to run, but "it is too early to be speculating about an election that is two years away." Poliquin strategist Brent Littlefield said he had "nothing to add" when asked if Poliquin is considering a bid.
Four other Republicans indicated openness to a run: Maine Republican Party Chairman Rick Bennett of Oxford; Maine Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason, R-Lisbon Falls; lobbyist and former Maine House Minority Leader Josh Tardy of Newport; and state Sen. Roger Katz of Augusta.
Tardy said he's in the "early stages" of considering a run and talking to people about supporting his potential candidacy, looking to make a decision by summer.
"I'd like to know what Sen. Collins or Congressman Poliquin are going to do, and that would certainly inform my decision," he said.
Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew of South China is also rumored to be considering a run. She was neutral on a run in an email, citing "critical issues" at the department that "deserve my full attention."
Ruling out a run was Cianbro President and CEO Peter Vigue of Pittsfield. Senate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, has said he won't run.
Democrats
One Democratic source said he'd put money on just two candidates in his party running at this point: Cote and Mills, with Lee perhaps next most likely. Cote and Lee would be the types of candidates that Democrats haven't traditionally run.
In 2010 and 2014, LePage beat two longtime legislators, Libby Mitchell and Mike Michaud. Poliquin twice beat Democrat Emily Cain, who boasted a 10-year legislative record, and Democrat Hillary Clinton lost Maine's 2nd District to the political outsider Trump this year.
Cote, an attorney from Sanford, finished second in the 2008 primary in Maine's 1st District won by Chellie Pingree, who went on to win the general election and still holds the seat. But he impressed, raising more than $650,000 and beating former legislators Michael Brennan and Ethan Strimling, who have since been mayor of Portland.
In a lengthy statement, Cote said he was considering a run, noting Maine's rural economic struggles and high rates of child poverty, calling for "smart, progressive economic growth in every part of Maine."
Lee of Cumberland has been active in Maine politics as a donor to Democratic candidates and causes and sits on several boards, including that of the Maine Conservation Voters. He said he's continuing to consider a run and will decide "in the next month or so."
Mills of Farmington didn't respond to a request for comment. Other past or current officeholders who said they're considering a run include Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap of Old Town and former Senate President Justin Alfond of Portland.
Pingree and former House Speaker Mark Eves of North Berwick gave neutral statements on the question. So did Lucas St. Clair of Portland, president of Elliotsville Plantation Inc., son of millionaire conservationist Roxanne Quimby and driving force behind the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument declared this year by President Barack Obama.
"This is the best state that I have ever lived in. I am so thankful that I am able to live here and raise my family here. And regardless of what is next for me professionally, I want to be part of the solutions," St. Clair said.
Ruling out runs were former House Speaker Hannah Pingree of North Haven, the congresswoman's daughter, and Yellow Light Breen of Holden, CEO of the Maine Development Foundation. Former state Rep. Adam Goode of Bangor said he hasn't considered running. Senate Minority Leader Troy Jackson of Allagash has said he won't run.
Independents
Cutler of Cape Elizabeth is the biggest name in the independent field, and he likely would have been governor had ranked-choice voting -- which he supported -- been the law in 2010.
That citizen-initiated law has constitutional questions, so it's unclear what role it will play in 2018. He got just 8 percent of votes in 2014 and told the Portland Press Herald in 2015 that he was "taking a vow of abstinence" from running again.
Now the CEO of the University of Maine System's Professional and Graduate Center Initiative, Cutler said in an email that the vow "certainly applies for so long" as he works there, "which would mean that since I remain in the System's employ, I really shouldn't comment any further."
"Nice to know, though, that at least in your eyes I still have 'potential!'" Cutler put in parentheses.
Moody's Collision Centers founder Shawn Moody of Gorham finished fourth in the 2010 race, mounting a late bid that garnered just 5 percent of votes, but lots of goodwill for Moody's genial disposition. LePage has appointed him to Maine's university and community college boards. Moody said it's "too early" to say whether he'll run again.
And another prominent independent, former state Sen. Dick Woodbury of Yarmouth, said he has no plans to run now and it's not likely that he will.

Fire victim was 51-year-old man
The victim of a Bellingham house fire has been identified as a 51-year-old man, according to the Worcester District Attorney's office. Firefighters found Bruce J. LeBlanc in the basement of his home on Rawson Road Friday morning, according to authorities. The fire started in numerous places throughout the home, Bellingham Fire Chief Steven Gentile said. Tim Connolly, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said Saturday that LeBlanc's death is not considered suspicious. He did not have any more information about the cause of the fire. Firefighters battled the blaze in frigid weather and gusty winds. The state fire marshal's office and State Police are continuing to investigate.
Brookline
Two arrested in armed robbery at bank
A man and a woman from Quincy were charged with armed robbery for allegedly robbing a TD Bank branch on Beacon Street Saturday morning, according to a statement from Brookline police. The suspects, a 25-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman, will not be identified until the investigation is complete, Lieutenant Philip Harrington said. The man allegedly passed a note to teller demanding money around 10:30 a.m. He then fled in a car driven by the woman. They were arrested shortly later. The pair are due to be arraigned Monday in Brookline District Court, police said.
Hartford
Officials oppose Northeast rail plan
Federal, state, and local officials in Connecticut are voicing opposition to a plan by federal railroad regulators to rebuild the congested Northeast Corridor over the coming decades. While praising the Federal Railroad Administration for wanting to fix crumbling infrastructure and reduce travel times along the Washington-Boston route, officials say Friday's plan still devastates Connecticut shoreline communities, despite some changes, including a proposed tunnel under the Connecticut River and Old Lyme. Activists plan to continue fighting the proposed 50-mile bypass from Old Saybrook to Rhode Island. (AP)
Portland
Group against pot drops recount bid
A group that campaigned against the legalization of marijuana in Maine has dropped its request for a recount. The opposition group said it has withdrawn its request with the secretary of state's office and is satisfied that the result approving marijuana legalization in Maine is accurate. The recount has involved more than 200,000 ballots and would have resumed in January. The anti-legalization group estimated that the recount cost less than $15,000 and that little to no overtime costs were necessary. Maine residents last month approved legalizing marijuana by a narrow 4,073-vote margin in an election that attracted more than 750,000 votes. (AP)
Pawtucket, R.I.
Statues stolen from creche replaced
A Roman Catholic priest has donated two statues to replace those stolen from a nativity scene outside an assisted living center in Pawtucket. The Mary and Joseph statues were stolen from the creche at the Jeanne Jugan Residence of the Little Sisters of the Poor on Dec. 10. The new statues, which cost about $900 combined, were donated by a priest at St. Thomas More Church. The home's operators say the nativity scene will be placed behind Plexiglas to prevent further thefts. The facility also is seeking donations to pay for an upgrade to its security system, which is expected to cost about $15,000. (AP)

Why adopting a senior animal might be right for you

Texto completo:   Maine's aging population and the number of senior pets looking for a new home could be the perfect match, according to those who work at the state's animal shelters.
"It can really open up options," Stacey Coventry, director of public relations at the Bangor Humane Society, said. "We have a growing elderly population in Maine, and if someone is still able to live independently at home or is living with supportive family, a senior citizen can really benefit from adopting an older pet."
A senior dog or cat -- a pet age 7 years or older -- may not have the energy level of a puppy or a kitten, but Coventry said that for many people, what an older pet lacks in bounce in more than makes up for in experience and wisdom.
That is what retirees Kate, 70, and Jim Burke, 68, were looking for when they were ready to adopt a dog last month.
"We had talked in terms of adopting a senior dog for a couple of years," Kate Bauer-Burke said. "We used to have black Labs and now have smaller King Charles Cavaliers, so we thought adopting an older dog with less energy would be a nice compromise."
The retired Kennebunkport couple began looking online and came across the social media page for the Maine-based senior dog rescue group Old Dogs, New Digs, where a 10-year-old springer spaniel named Darla caught their eye.
"When we found out she was just over in Kennebunk, we went over to see her and volunteered to foster her," Bauer-Burke said. "She was with us for two weeks, and we decided, 'Yep, this could work,' so now she's ours forever."
Like many rescue dogs, Darla -- who the Burkes renamed Derry -- had gaps in her personal history.
"We understand she is from South Carolina," Bauer-Burke said. "We were told she lost her family and home as the result of a hurricane."
The couple's two smaller dogs are registered therapy animals, and Bauer-Burke said Derry is fitting into her new home quite nicely.
"A lot of people think they can't adopt a pet because they are too busy or they are older and not able to be as active as a young pet," Coventry said. "A senior pet is often already housebroken, obedience and leash trained so it can provide all the benefits of a companion pet without requiring a lot of training."
At the same time, she said, older pets often view a warm lap or spot in front of a fire with daily strolls as the perfect retirement plan, a lifestyle that matches with the elderly.
"The reality is a senior pet won't be one of our more active animals or in need of a lot of attention," Coventry said. "So being able to match with a senior citizen is a great fit."
Take Tucker, for instance.
The 15-year-old beagle-Lab mix came to the Bangor shelter through a municipal animal control surrender, and Coventry said he is simply the perfect gentleman looking for a good retirement home.
"He is just super sweet," she said. "And just a handsome fellow."
Like so many older dogs or cats looking for a new home, Tucker found himself in a situation beyond his control.
"We never want to judge anyone who has to surrender a pet," Coventry said. "Ultimately, if a person can no longer care for the pet and can't rehome it privately, we want them to come to us."
Once at the shelter, Coventry said, the pet is given a thorough check up, any medical issues identified and its behaviour evaluated to allow the staff to make sure the animal is matched with the best new owner.
"There are all kinds of reasons people have to give up senior pets," Coventry said. "Some people have to move into assisted living that does not allow pets, some people have to relocate due to work or there are times a new dog or cat is brought into the home [and] does not get along with the older pet, and often it is that older pet that gets surrendered."
Working with surrendered pets at the no-kill Animal Welfare Society Shelter in Kennebunk, Stephanie Kelley, marketing associate, has seen or heard it all.
"I'm really not shocked by anything anymore," Kelley said. "But we want the community to know we are a resource they can contact. We can provide a surrendered pet the care it needs until it can find a new home."
Kelley said her shelter's staff will work with pet owners who may just need some temporary help or guidance to medical resources that would allow them to keep an aging pet.
"We just want that pet to be comfortable and happy," she said.
When a senior pet does end up at the Animal Welfare Society, Kelley said there is often little trouble in finding it that new home.
"People really do think about adopting a senior, and there is not a huge bias against those older dogs or cats," she said. "A lot of these people have had a dog or cat from puppy or kitten for years and after a full lifetime of that pet, they know how to deal with senior issues and have that knowledge base to take care of an older pet."
A senior dog or cat may require regular medications to treat age-related conditions such as arthritis, diabetes or hypothyroidism.
Derry came with a few medical issues, according to Bauer-Burke, including a treatable thyroid condition and a number of fatty "lumps" common to older dogs.
"That's one of the advantages of adopting a senior through a shelter," Coventry said. "We take care of evaluating their medical condition so you know going in what you are dealing with."
That care can come at a cost, she said.
"We just make sure the new family has a solid relationship with their veterinarian and understand there might be some added expenses," she said. "Those are the realities of taking care of a pet in its golden years."
At the Animal Welfare Society, which works with Old Dogs, New Digs, Kelley said a senior pet comes with few surprises.
"When you meet the senior dog or cat, their behavior is set and what you see is what you get," she said. "They are set in their ways in a really good sense [because] they know what they want and what they like to do."
In the case of Dunkin, a 15-year-old tabby looking for a home, that means a quiet home where he can sit on a lap, look out a window and make sure his feline diabetes is kept under control.
"We just love Dunkin," Kelley said. "With proper medical care, he can live to be 18 or 20. We know the right family is out there for him."
It's the same for the other senior pets at the shelters around Maine.
"There is a population out there that loves the senior dogs and cats," Kelley said. "Their hearts just go out to them."
For the Burkes, there are no regrets about taking in a senior pet.
"Older animals are just wonderful and they bring you so much," Bauer-Burke said. "We are older, and a senior pet is ideal for retirees. We get to have a dog, and we give that dog a home."

Texto completo:   WISCASSET, Maine -- In 1998, still flush with tax money from the Maine Yankee atomic power plant -- which had closed two years earlier -- Wiscasset opened a multimillion-dollar community center just outside the heart of town.
Now, almost 20 years later, the center remains open, but the community it is serving in this coastal town, billed as "the prettiest village in Maine," looks like it's lost its way.
Municipal government is wracked by turmoil, with elected officials resigning, a citizens group aggressively challenging selectmen's decisions, and basic policy matters decided by petitions and referendum.
A school system that routinely turned away tuition students because it ranked among the best in Maine now struggles with massive enrollment declines, annual budget travails, and questions about its leadership and direction.
Meanwhile, an agreement between state and local officials to try to resolve a traffic bottleneck on Route 1 -- after half a century of negotiations -- has drawn organized opposition, legal warnings and a petition.
How did Wiscasset reach this point?
Many residents see it as the inevitable fallout from the nuclear plant's closure. Others see it as a cautionary tale for other Maine communities, such as mill towns, that struggle to adapt when a seismic change occurs to its economic base.
From boom to the edge of bust
For awhile during the quarter century Maine Yankee generated power on Bailey Point, Wiscasset residents -- many of them power plant employees who drew an average salary of $54,000 -- didn't even pay for their own utilities.
In 1996, when the plant shut down for good, Maine Yankee paid the town nearly $13 million in property taxes -- about 91 percent of the town's entire tax base, according to tax records.
Former Selectwoman Judy Flanagan, a longtime resident of Wiscasset and a vice chairwoman of the Board of Selectmen until resigning in November, remembers the envious reactions when she told people she lived in Wiscasset.
"Every town would like to have had that pocketbook we had," she said in an interview.
Two decades later, Maine Yankee's employees and much of its tax base are long gone. The burden of struggling to live with a slimmer pocketbook has frayed many in a town that longtime resident Bill Sutter said "has developed a big city attitude, with big city amenities and budgets, when we are in fact a small town."
Town facilities have not been upgraded, or in some cases maintained, since the Maine Yankee years. Most notably, a failing sewer plant has violated environmental standards for a second time, this year triggering fines of nearly $20,000. The plant also will need repairs that could easily reach $100,000, according to information provided by town officials.
Enrollment in Wiscasset schools has plummeted from about 950 in the late 1990s to 554 last year, according to the school department. Despite costs both financial and otherwise, the town voted to withdraw from its regional school district to maintain local control.
Poverty has increased, as have tensions among residents who have battled fiercely this year over one issue after the other, including asking voters to cast ballots in November to decide whether firefighters could continue washing their personal trucks at the station. (They can).
A slippery slope?
From 1972 to 1996, Maine Yankee, Maine's only nuclear power plant, generated 119 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. By 1987, just before a third failed referendum on closing the plant and long before equipment failures and a series of outages would eventually trigger its shutdown, the plant was producing a quarter of the power for the state of Maine, the New York Times reported.
As the kilowatts increased, the town flourished during what are now known as "the Maine Yankee years."
The schools, which according to the New York Times spent $12,000 per student, "had at their disposal about everything they could want," said Bill Cumming of Wiscasset, who served as principal of Wiscasset High School from 1970 to 1992.
While officials were "conservative," Cumming said Wednesday that the abundance prompted talk of creating an "academy" with other towns "to share the wealth with other schools."
"They really seemed to get anything they wanted," Cumming's wife, Joan Cumming, added.
But in 1999, after paying nearly $13 million in property taxes the previous year, Maine Yankee's taxes fell to less than half that amount.
By 2013, Wiscasset ranked as the fourth-poorest community in the state, the Boston Globe reported at the time, and property taxes had increased more than tenfold.
In October, residents opened their property tax bills to find a 14.1 percent increase over last year alone -- an increase that would have been 22 percent had selectmen not voted, narrowly and against the advice of the town's auditor, to spend $600,000 from the town's reserve funds to mitigate the increase.
The decision to do so was not without controversy, with some arguing that relying on savings is a slippery slope.
"What about next year?" said Sutter, who has lived in Wiscasset for about 70 years. "Next year, those funds aren't going to be available, and they've already voted to have a flat budget next year, which is based on the [originally proposed] 22 percent increase this year. And you have no money to go over any of your budget [items] for this year. Suppose we have a disaster or a hard winter. We have no money."
How to pay future bills is on the minds of many these days, but the specter of Maine Yankee lingers.
"The Maine Yankee appetite is still there, but the Maine Yankee tax income is not," Sutter said recently.
"There are real needs," Flanagan said. "I have said that, even a little during the Maine Yankee days, we haven't been good in maintaining, and it ends up costing us more to fix the infrastructure."
Knowing that it would likely increase property tax rates, townspeople voted in 2013 to withdraw from Regional School Unit 12, a decision most say was prompted by a desire for local control, but one that cost the town more than $3 million, including $2 million to be paid back in 10 annual installments of $228,000, the first due this year.
In addition to the financial burden, withdrawal has had other costs: Years of plummeting enrollment led the town to close its primary school and reshuffle all students into the former middle and high schools.
The impact on Wiscasset's sense of community is evident. School athletic teams -- known as the Redskins until being changed by a 2011 regional school board vote that still prompts fiery debate -- have dwindled to the point that the middle school had no baseball team for two years and only six high school students expressed interest in a team, the Wiscasset Newspaper reported.
Bickering in public
The pressure of learning to live with less has prompted formerly noncontroversial issues to bubble over into public spats.
Several times, most recently last year, Wiscasset selectmen have asked voters if they wanted to eliminate the town's Police Department and rely on county and state police. Each time they have opted to keep the force.
In November, after months of rancor, residents voted nearly 2-to-1 to again allow the town's volunteer firefighters to wash personal vehicles at the station. The longtime tradition had ended in April after the town said it violated policy, but firefighters, led by Chief T.J. Merry, petitioned, arguing that they frequently went to fires in their own trucks, and that the perk was a small price to pay for their service.
Despite an opinion by the town's attorney that the practice could make the town liable for any injuries, voters agreed with the firefighters.
No long after, Tim Merry, a former selectman and former fire chief, proposed eliminating the town manager position and returning to a town meeting or town administrator form of government. Merry told the Lincoln County News that Wiscasset is "a small town with a big-town spending problem."
Just this week, after a vote to approve a $1.75 million energy project for the town's schools, a school committee member spoke out about "unfair allegations, untrue statements and, frankly, some bad political theater" directed at Superintendent of Schools Heather Wilmot earlier this month during a meeting of the selectmen, the Wiscasset Newspaper reported.
But the most high-profile drama this year involves a proposed $5 million traffic-easing project designed to clear Main Street traffic that each summer creeps up and down a section of Route 1 as slowly as the line at nearby Red's Eats. The plan includes installing several traffic lights and eliminating on-street parking along Main Street.
A group of residents, led by Sutter, have organized as the Wiscasset Taxpayers Alliance to oppose the project, which voters selected from three options at a nonbinding June vote.
Sutter said that vote was poorly managed. Furthermore, he said, the plan has changed so substantially that the nonbinding vote should be invalidated.
In early September, residents learned that although the plan they voted to support was pitched as almost completely federally funded, with the final $1 million paid by the state, the Maine Department of Transportation will instead use the $4 million in federal funding slated for the Wiscasset project on other projects.
The news prompted some to feel hoodwinked. Others, such as Sutter, suggested the switch is an attempt to skirt federal laws designed to protect historic and environmentally sensitive areas, such as the 1916 Haggett's Garage and the Creamery Wharf -- both initially proposed to become parking lots.
Department of Transportation project manager Ernie Martin said that he still planned to "follow a federal-like process" and would "try to meet all the needs to not impact this section of town as far as historical integrity."
Flanagan said she's confident the town's historic preservation committee will protect the town's properties, but residents must be ready to compromise.
Still others object to what Sutter estimates would be about $40,000 in maintenance costs the town would end up paying.
"Wiscasset does not have a traffic problem," Sutter said recently. "The people who wish to get through have a problem and the state of Maine has a problem in that Wiscasset is a bottleneck and they have an obligation to get traffic through it."
The traffic-easing plan's impact on downtown businesses also drew criticism.
"I have a lot of older patrons," R. Keith Rendall said Thursday from his Main Street art gallery. "If they have to park two blocks down and walk up, they just will not do that."
"For my business, I can't imagine more growth in the summer," Stacy Linehan, who has owned the popular Treats upscale bakery and deli for 11 years, said Thursday while looking out over an icy town. "We struggle to keep up as it is."
Linehan, who lives in nearby Westport Island, said she was drawn to the area more than 20 years ago because it was "quaint and cute and clean and a safe place for my children."
Although growth is inevitable, she said, "It's important to protect the integrity of the villages in Maine. People want it to be like it was 100 years ago, and towns do have to be really mindful of how we grow."
Still, despite vocal opposition and several letters from an attorney representing a large downtown property owner warning that any such vote would be illegal, the Board of Selectmen voted to authorize Town Manager Marian Anderson on Nov. 15 to sign a letter of intent to move forward with the Department of Transportation project as endorsed by the nonbinding vote.
The Wiscasset Taxpayers Alliance has initiated a petition to ask residents to invalidate the June vote.
Hope amid the stress
The same night the board voted to approve a letter of intent, and shortly after being appointed to an advisory committee to the project, Flanagan resigned from the Board of Selectmen.
While Flanagan said recently that she resigned for personal reasons, including wanting to spend time with her 4-year-old grandson, she acknowledged that her 18 months on the board were "very stressful."
"Life is too short to be stressed," she said. "We are having issue after issue. I know other board members have been as frustrated as I am. You've got to disagree without being disagreeable. I don't want to single us out -- we are probably no worse [than other towns] -- but it's what I've had to deal with, and I just think it's ridiculous to not be able to talk and listen and understand each other.
"It's been a real adjustment for those people who have been here, and even some who moved here because of the low tax rate," she said of tax bills that in some cases jumped from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. "They've had to adjust to what I call 'What everyone else is paying around the state.'"
While the power plant's financial impact is greatly diminished, a stark reminder of Maine Yankee's indelible link to Wiscasset remains in the form of 550 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel still stored in 60 airtight steel canisters encased in concrete stored in at its Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation near the site of the former reactor. Maine Yankee has been in litigation with the federal government since 1998 over the government's failure to meet legal obligations to remove and dispose of the spent fuel. Many locals say they don't hold out much hope the waste will ever be moved.
But Flanagan, a librarian, said recently she's optimistic about the future of Wiscasset, which she said is poised to "bounce back."
She noted that even with the recent increase, and despite such amenities as an airport and a community center, Wiscasset's property tax rate is still $18.71 per $1,000 -- far from nearby Brunswick's at $29.35 per $1,000, for example.
But Flanagan is confident that Wiscasset will work through its growing pains and move forward. She even alluded to "some things in the wings that I can't talk about -- but that have potential for the economy here."
"I am very optimistic that this town is on the rebound," she said. "I've seen it over the last several years. If you look at our downtown, we used to have empty shops, and we don't now, and we've got a chamber and good businesses down there. As much as we locals hate to admit it, we are becoming a tourist town, but we have such potential between our waterfront and our historic village and our airport and our community center. We have a lot to offer. I think you're going to find that we are bouncing back."

Texto completo:   As summer approaches, theater companies from around the state are announcing their 2016-2017 theater seasons. From comedies to love stories to a tale that will hit close to home for those with ties to the paper industry, there will be much to see on Maine stages next season.
At the Penobscot Theatre Company in Bangor, the 2016-2017 season will begin with a show that has been on producing artistic director Bari Newport's mind for a long time. "Calendar Girls" will make its Maine professional theater premiere at the historic Bangor Opera House. The production chronicles the trials of a group of ladies and their friend Annie, whose husband dies of leukemia. In an effort to raise funds for a commemorative settee at the hospital, a plan is hatched to have the women pose nude for a calendar.
"We've been sitting on the rights for 'Calendar Girls' for almost two years now. There was a small production done in Portland. The Portland Players, a community theater, did it for three or four performances in the very beginning of [2015]. Ever since then no other theater has been able to do it because we've been waiting for the opening slot of this season. The whole notion of doing 'Calendar Girls' was to have women on our stage who may not have had a lot of opportunities recently to be on the stage," Newport said.
The show, based on a true story, will feature local talent, including Sharon Zolper, Amy Roeder, Jasmine Ireland, Margo Lukens, Irene Dennis, Julie Lisnet and Alison Cox.
Also peppered throughout the season are a handful of comedic shows, including "Murder for Two," a musical murder-mystery featuring two piano-playing actors, one who investigates the crime and another who plays all the suspects, which is also a Maine premiere.
Also on the docket are two more Maine premieres, "Lumberjacks in Love," and "I Loved, I Lost, I Ate Spaghetti," the latter of which will feature a dinner prepared on stage by the actress.
"Eight tables are served a full pasta dinner, and she makes the full dinner over the course of the play, completely from scratch. It's a funny play, it's a true story and it has a great gimmick, which is this dinner. I think people will love it, even if they're not eating," Newport said.
The holiday production for the PTC this year is a classic Dickens tale -- but not the one you'd expect. "Oliver!" will be staged Dec. 1-24, in all its "Please, sir, may I have more?" glory.
The PTC also will be the second company ever to stage Monica Wood's "Papermaker," which tells the story of a paper mill strike in a small Maine town. It premiered in Portland in April 2015 and will be staged by PTC in March 2017. "Papermaker" is novelist Wood's first play and touches on subjects that will be familiar to many Maine people, including issues concerning mill town life.
A surprise seventh show will be announced in August, and the season will include children's productions via the company's dramatic academy. Those will include "The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales," "The Neverending Story" and "Ramona Quimby," according to director of education Roeder.
PTC isn't the only professional theater company gearing up for the next season. Travel south, and a completely different roundup of shows offers even more variety to Maine's theater scene.
A Pulitzer Prize-winner, a tale of romance, a Christmas classic, a one-man show, a historical drama and a story about the struggles of everyday life -- these and many others comprise the 2016-2017 season for Portland Stage.
Their common bond?
"The theme this season is around love and marriage and family, how people build their personal lives," Anita Stewart, executive and artistic director of Portland Stage, said. "We try to get a good range of material -- stuff that's going to be funny, stuff that's going to be moving and poignant, stuff that will make you think."
The season started taking shape with A.R. Gurney's "Later Life," a tale of two people who meet at a cocktail party.
"We're bookending that with the final show of the season, which is 'Disgraced,'" Stewart said. "Disgraced," a 2013 Pulitzer Prize winner, is "multicultural, hard-hitting, fast-paced, and features multiethnic relationships," Stewart said. "It's about how the world has moved to where it is now."
Following "Later Life," "Sotto Voce" will be staged in November.
"The second show is a play by Nilo Cruz, and it's about a woman who is older, lives by herself, doesn't see people, is hermitted and has memories of the past of the great love of her life, who was a man who ended up being on board a cruise ship leaving Germany during the Second World War," Stewart said.
Portland Stage's season isn't complete without Charles Dickens classic "A Christmas Carol." Another classic, "Arsenic and Old Lace," will follow in January and March will feature "Buyer and Cellar," a one-man show.
The winner of The Clauder Competition, a competition that takes place every three years, will stage in April 2017. This year, Brenda Withers' play, "String Around My Finger," was chosen from 240 submissions.
"It's about a woman and man who are about the get married and have a medical emergency that makes them go, 'Woah. Where do we go from here?'" Stewart said.
Community theater companies are preparing for their new seasons as well, including Some Theatre Company, a new addition to the Greater Bangor theatre scene.
Some Theatre Company only got their last year, but their second season is planned and the company is excited to undertake a new, challenging list of productions.
To start off their season, the company will stage "Next to Normal" in November, a rock musical that takes on some heavy subject material, including bipolar disorder, suicide and drug abuse.
"It's a feel-everything musical. It's a rock musical, and there's very little dialogue. It follows the story of a family, and something happens to the mother/wife and she is diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder. We meet up with her in the middle of a bad episode. She sees a psychiatrist, and things gradually get worse. She has electroshock therapy. It chronicles her journey," artistic director Elaine Bard said.
"I wanted something a little deeper -- a little darker and edgier. We're in a place in society where there's a lot of mental health issues, so it seemed like something people could relate to, even if it's not them who has a mental disorder," Bard said.
This commitment to work that is difficult in nature will continue on in the March 2017 production of "Agnes of God," the story of a nun whose infant has been found strangled. She insists the child was the result of virgin conception and an investigation ensues.
"We don't want to always do stuff just because it's fluffy and nice and it can make money. It's nice to do a show that's a little darker and edgier -- that has a different story and meaning to it," Bard said.
"A lot of these shows are not traditionally done because they're so hard to do as an actor. I think a lot of people don't believe they can push community actors to get there, but we're confident in the community and our people." Erryn Bard, Elaine's daughter and secretary of the Some Theatre Company board, said.
"I think most actors are looking for that deep challenge and want to push themselves in these roles," Elaine Bard said.
In addition to these productions, Some Theatre Company will stage "Velveteen Rabbit" in December, which was written by Mainer Andrew Frodhal. The show will feature puppetry and consist of a children and adult cast. The company will stage their productions for the 2016-2017 season in the Keith Anderson Community House in Orono.
To complete the season, a surprise fourth show, a family musical, is in the works for May 2017.
From productions lovingly produced by members of Maine's communities, to shows featuring unfamiliar, fresh faces, there's something for everyone in the upcoming season of Maine theater productions.

Texto completo:   The Maine Department of Health and Human Services has reignited the debate over General Assistance provided to asylum seekers living in Maine.
The LePage administration has released new policies that exclude some asylum seekers from receiving General Assistance, reigniting the debate over an issue that immigrant advocacy groups insist was settled by the Legislature last year.
In rules completed last week, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services clarified that only immigrants who meet a federal law's definition of "lawfully present" or who have applied for asylum should be eligible for General Assistance. Municipalities that repeatedly provide assistance to immigrants deemed ineligible by DHHS could lose all of the state reimbursements for General Assistance - a potential loss of millions of dollars in Portland.
Critics already are threatening legal action because the DHHS rules state that asylum seekers who have yet to file a federal application would be ineligible for assistance. That violates the intention of the law passed by the Legislature last year, according to immigration advocates and one lawmaker involved in crafting the law.
"It will make people homeless and that will have an impact on shelters," said Alain Nahimana, coordinator of the Maine Immigrants' Rights Coalition. "We are back in the same situation as one year ago where people the law was intending to help are being denied assistance."
After months of debate, lawmakers passed a bill last year that allows asylum-seeking immigrants to receive General Assistance for up to two years. Gov. Paul LePage had fought to cut off state General Assistance reimbursements to municipalities that provide welfare to the growing number of immigrants seeking asylum in Maine from war-torn or politically unstable counties in central Africa.
The bill, which became law after LePage failed to veto it in time, defined a person eligible for General Assistance as anyone "who is lawfully present in the United States or who is pursuing a lawful process to apply for immigration relief."
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF LAW
In a statement, DHHS said the department began rulemaking "with the sole intent of clarifying the law such that it could be effectively administered on behalf of Maine taxpayers."
"The Legislature clearly intended to give General Assistance to some number of non-citizens who were not eligible before, but they also didn't pass a law making everyone in the world eligible for welfare, so therefore the rule must define precisely who is and who is not eligible in accordance with the law," the department stated.
But critics contend that DHHS is wrongly excluding immigrants who are preparing their asylum applications but have yet to file them with federal immigration officials. Federal law allows non-citizens to file for asylum within one year of entering the United States, regardless of how they arrived in the country. The vast majority of asylum seekers in Maine arrive in the U.S. on student, work or visitation visas that expire within six months, meaning they have six months to complete the lengthy and complicated asylum application before facing possible deportation.
Federal law also prohibits asylum seekers from receiving legal work permits for at least six months after they file their application. And many asylum seekers wait years for interviews with immigration officials because of a growing national backlog.
COURT CHALLENGE CONSIDERED
Robyn Merrill of Maine Equal Justice Partners, a nonprofit that provides legal help and advocacy to immigrants, said her organization and others are "taking steps and giving serious consideration" to challenging the DHHS rules in Maine courts. She argued that immigrants who are preparing their application or who are working with some of the pro bono legal teams that help with asylum applications are clearly "pursuing a lawful process to apply for immigration relief."
"The intent was to provide this bridge of temporary support to people, and this (rule) very much flies in the face of that," said Merrill, who was very active in the legislative debate over the bill. "It's unfortunate that so much time and energy has gone into attempting to deny benefits ... to people who we should be welcoming to this state and who have so much to offer."
DHHS said the department stands behind the rule.
"Welfare industry lobbyists like MEJP (Maine Equal Justice Partners) want to define 'pursuing a lawful process' as literally anyone who happens to be in Maine, regardless of their legal status or whether or not they have filed required asylum applications with the federal government," the department said in a statement. "For example, if an immigrant came to America on a student visa, allowed that visa to expire, and still had not applied for asylum, MEJP wants them to be considered an 'asylum seeker' anyway and provide them welfare. While legislators may have chosen to provide benefits to immigrant non-citizens who are here with lawful status or taking formal steps to gain lawful status, the law clearly does not require General Assistance to be granted to immigrant non-citizens with no legal status or no application for immigration relief."
The state Attorney General's Office reviewed and approved the new rules after suggesting several changes, the DHHS said.
Rep. Drew Gattine, a Westbrook Democrat who helped craft the bill as co-chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, also disagreed with the department's reading of the law. The Legislature intentionally left the wording broad in order to capture non-citizens who are working on but have yet to file asylum applications.
"I think the department chose to take the most narrow interpretation that they could get away with, and that will leave some people out in the cold," Gattine said.
DHHS TO PENALIZE REPEAT VIOLATORS
The policy could have significant policy implications for Portland, which has been in LePage's cross hairs on the General Assistance issue for well over a year.
Anticipating that DHHS would adopt a narrow interpretation of the law, Portland city officials set aside $250,000 to provide assistance for 90 to 100 non-citizens expected to be deemed ineligible for the state General Assistance program.
DHHS spokesman John Martins said Tuesday that municipalities that repeatedly violate the state's rules on would-be asylum seekers would be required to put together a "corrective action plan to come into compliance."
"If the corrective action was not completed and non-compliance continued, all reimbursement would be withheld until the municipality was in compliance, in accordance with GA laws and rules," Martins said.
Portland has received upward of $5 million in General Assistance reimbursements from the state in recent years. Asked about the potential loss of state money, City Hall spokeswoman Jessica Grondin replied: "Our legal counsel is still reviewing the rule and its implications on our GA program."

Texto completo:   Maine moves up in ranking of clean technology
Maine has moved up in a ranking of states based on clean technology policies, use and development.
The state moved from 22nd to 18th on the Clean Tech Leadership Index, which is put together by Clean Edge, a research and advisory firm in the clean technology sector.
Maine gained in the ranking of the states in overall technology, where it moved up from 15th to ninth, and in policy, where it gained eight spots to move from 27th to 19th. The state also moved up in the ranking for biomass generation, from 15th to ninth, but lost its top spot in smart-meter market penetration to Nevada and fell a spot, from 24th to 25th, in capital for clean technologies.
"The new Clean Tech Leadership Index follows other recent reports demonstrating that Maine's wind, tidal and biomass resources position the state for economic progress throughout its alternative energy sector," said Jeff Marks, executive director of the Environmental and Energy Technology Council of Maine.
"For those of us who work to promote Maine's clean tech economy - E2Tech (the Environmental and Energy Technology Council of Maine) and the Maine Technology Institute, among other organizations - and for the many new and growing Maine businesses in this sector, it is encouraging to see the results of this work recognized," said Jim Katsiaficas, the board chairman of E2Tech.
Katsiaficas pointed out, however, that all five of the other New England states rank higher than Maine, led by Massachusetts, which is ranked second nationally; Vermont, third; and Connecticut, eighth.
California was ranked first among the states and San Francisco, San Jose and San Diego were ranked as the top large metropolitan areas.

Texto completo:   Boy Scout chaperone from Mass. fell out of raft in West Forks on Dead River
North Country Rivers was operating a commercial rafting trip in accordance with state law on Saturday when a Massachusetts man who was a Boy Scout chaperone fell out and died, the Maine Warden Service said.
In a news release Tuesday, the warden service said the fatal rafting accident in West Forks Plantation was "a rare incident involving Maine's whitewater rafting industry, as it has been several years since a fatality has occurred."
Michael Arena, 52, of Lexington, Massachusetts, was on a commercial rafting trip with North Country Rivers, a whitewater rafting outfitter out of Bingham, when he fell out of the raft as it was going through a series of whitewater rapids on the Dead River. The warden service responded to a report of an unresponsive man about 2 p.m.
Arena was a chaperone with a group of four Boy Scouts, one of whom was his son, according to the warden service. There were seven people in the raft, including a guide, two chaperones and four teenage boys, the service said.
Upper Kennebec Valley Ambulance pronounced Arena dead at the scene. The warden service said Tuesday that Arena's cause of death has not yet been determined.
Sgt. Chris Simmons, with the Maine Warden Service, told WickedLocal.com of Lexington, Massachusetts, that Arena likely drowned as he was pushed under strong turbulent waves.
Reached by phone Tuesday, Jim Murton, the owner of North Country Rivers, declined comment. On Monday, Murton would only say that "the rafting trips are safe. There are no problems at all with the trips. It was an accident."
Hank Manz, the scoutmaster for Troop 160 in Lexington, Massachusetts, said Tuesday he didn't know additional details of the accident -- he was not on the trip -- and he intentionally has not questioned anyone from the troop involved in the trip, in order to "let the authorities do their investigation."
Manz called the incident an "incredible tragedy."
"Here at the local level, we are focused on support of the Arena family and the Scouts and adults on the trip," Manz said. "The first thing we want to do is minimize anymore upheaval and pressure in their lives."
The warden service said nearly 70,000 people commercially raft Maine's rivers each year.
Cpl. John MacDonald, a warden service spokesman, did not immediately respond to a call Tuesday seeking further comment.
Manz said that about a dozen Scouts and six adults traveled to Maine for the rafting trip. He wasn't sure if they had previously used the services of North Country Rivers. "We do some sort of outdoor trip every month, and most Scout troops do that, and we have certainly done whitewater rafting before," he said.
Troop 160 has more than 80 Scouts and many adult volunteers and chaperones like Arena who "are a huge part of making Scouting available," Manz said.
Manz declined to talk about Arena personally, saying that was more appropriate for family members, who were not available for comment.

The LePage administration has released new policies that exclude would-be asylum seekers from receiving General Assistance, reigniting the debate over an issue that immigrant advocacy groups insist was settled by the Legislature last year.

Texto completo:   Sightings reported throughout Northeast
Portland police Sgt. Tim Farris was on patrol early Tuesday when he witnessed a speeder he never expected: a spectacular fiery streak that lit up the night sky.
The streak was the apparent trail of a meteor burning up as it passed through the Earth's atmosphere about 12:50 a.m.
Farris was parked in front of the Central Fire Station on Congress Street looking for speeders at the time, and his cruiser's dashcam captured the fireball streaking across the sky behind Franklin Towers. The video was posted on the department's Facebook page Tuesday.
Over in Cumberland, Officer Scott Hendee was on patrol when his dashcam recorded the fireball lighting up the sky.
"Unfortunately, the fireball and large flame trail were just out of the camera's frame," the department wrote on its Facebook page. "It was the most impressive one we've ever seen!"
The American Meteor Society shared the Portland police video on its website, generating so much traffic it apparently caused the site to crash Tuesday morning. A map posted by the society showed clusters of reports of meteor sightings throughout the Northeast, but most occurred in coastal Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut. A total of 516 sightings from Canada to New Jersey were reported as of 6 p.m. Tuesday.
"The fireball was seen primarily from Maine, but witnesses from Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Ontario (Canada) and Quebec (Canada) also reported the event," the society said on its website.
The society described the meteor as "an amazing experience for witnesses."
"There was a 3- to 5-minute delay from the time I saw it to the boom I heard and felt, very loud and shook the home, unlike anything I have ever experienced before," Craig C., of Canton, Maine, wrote in a comment posted on the society's website.
The society's Facebook page also had comments from people in Canton and Rumford who had seen and heard the meteor.
The American Meteor Society is asking anyone who saw the meteor to fill out an official "fireball report" through its website.
A meteor is the flash of light emitted by a small chunk of interplanetary debris, or meteoroid, as it burns up while passing through the Earth's atmosphere, the American Meteor Society website says. A meteoroid that survives its passage through the atmosphere and strikes the ground is a meteorite.
Most meteors become visible while passing through the region of the atmosphere called the thermosphere. This "meteoric region" is 50 miles to 75 miles in altitude. Most meteoroids, which can vary in size from small grains to 1 meter wide, enter the atmosphere at speeds ranging from 25,000 mph to 160,000 mph, according to the American Meteor Society.
The society's website said the meteor spotted early Tuesday in the Northeast was a fireball, the term given to a meteor that is brighter than the planet Venus in the morning or evening sky. Several thousand meteors of fireball magnitude occur in the Earth's atmosphere each day, but the vast majority occur over oceans or uninhabited regions and many are masked by daylight, the website said.
For many of the people who filed a report on the society's website, seeing the fireball was a first-time experience. An observation report filed by Joe S., of Gorham, described the fireball as a "once-in-a-lifetime event thus far" and "somewhat terrifying."
"The fireball looked like it had lightning bolts in the middle of it as it came closer to the horizon," Joe S. wrote. "As it approached the horizon the entire sky turned white as if lightning struck close by."
Another Maine man, Armando M., of Lewiston, filed a report with the society that described the fireball as white with blue and orange streaks.
"I have seen two fireballs in my lifetime and, as a physics major and amateur astronomer, this was the most stunning sky event I have ever seen," he wrote.
Barbra Barrett, director of the Maine Mineral and Gem Museum in Bethel, said that based on the eyewitness accounts it collected, the American Meteor Society mapped a trajectory for the meteoroid that shows it appears to have entered the Earth's atmosphere over Maine and its "terminal explosion" occurred about 20 miles west of Rangeley, in Franklin County.
Barrett would like people who witnessed the meteor to contact her with information about what they saw, heard or felt. She's hoping the witness accounts could help identify where the meteoroid would have landed -- if it didn't disintegrate during its trip through the atmosphere -- so it could be recovered and included in the museum's extensive display of meteorites from around the world. She said it is rare for a meteorite to be found in Maine, because most fall into wooded areas or into water.
"I think there's a real possibility here to recover the meteorite," Barrett said. "It's a unique opportunity for Maine to see and possibly recover a meteorite after seeing a fireball in the sky."
The meteor sighting in Maine is particularly timely for officials from the mineral museum, who met last week with consultants about establishing the Maine Fireball Network. The museum will set up special cameras throughout the state which, when used together, can determine the speed and trajectory of a fireball and assist in the recovery of meteorite fragments, Barrett said. She said the network will be the first major network in New England.
"While we wish we were already operational, I'm just glad this didn't happen last week, as it would have been one heck of a distraction," Barrett said. "We are very excited."
Anyone who saw the meteor Tuesday morning and wants to share information can contact Barrett at bbarrett@mainemineralmuseum.org or 824-3036. She said the museum will offer a $20,000 reward if a 1 kilogram meteorite is recovered. It will receive a place of honor in the museum's Meteorite Hall.
The Portland Police Department's video had more than 151,000 views and more than 400 comments by Tuesday afternoon.
"You never know what you are going to see on duty. Sgt. Farris was looking for speeders while parked in front of the central fire station and was able to observe some visitors 'from away' ... far away. The meteor (or alien spaceship) was caught on camera at approximately 0050 hours," the Portland Police Department wrote in its post. "Let's hope the visitors are friendly. They could just be some of Stephen King's friends on their way to visit him. Whomever they are, I'm sure we could win them over with a whoopie pie. P.S. The voice on the video stating, "Oh my God"! is from Ofc. (Graham) Hults. Apparently he was amazed."

Texto completo:   Jay Bradshaw of Belgrade, former director of Maine EMS, is among the EMS providers who will be honored at the State House Tuesday as part of the annual State EMS Awards. Jay will be receiving the governor's award.
Jay Bradshaw of Belgrade served agency for 28 years
AUGUSTA -- Jay Bradshaw, former chief of the Winthrop Ambulance Service who went on to lead Maine's bureau of emergency medical services, was among those recognized Tuesday at an annual awards ceremony to honor all men and women who pick up the phone, day or night, when Mainers are in desperate need of medical attention.
About 100 people attended the event in the State House Hall of Flags.
Among those celebrated were paramedics, emergency medical technicians, physicians, rescue services and a health center, each from different parts of the state.
Following the ceremony, wreaths were laid outside the State House to commemorate eight emergency service providers from Maine who have died in the line of duty. The most recent of those deceased was Peter Larlee of East Millinocket, who had a heart attack following an emergency call on March 2.
Bradshaw, of Belgrade, took home the largest hardware of the day. He retired last year after 28 years working for the state, the majority as director of emergency medical services.
For that service, Bradshaw earned the Governor's Award. According to a program for the event, the Governor's Award is "for exceptional contribution to the EMS system at the state, national or system-wide level, with contributions in multiple areas of EMS."
Bradshaw's successor at the helm of the state's emergency medical services, Shaun St. Germain, presented the award and listed several of Bradshaw's accomplishments: implementing statewide training standards, growing the state's emergency medicine system and making Maine's emergency medical services a national model.
In remarks to the audience, Bradshaw thanked those who had served as his mentors, including his predecessor at the state emergency medicine bureau, Kevin McGinnis.
"I was ambulance director in Winthrop when Kevin McGinnis became state EMS director, and I was so impressed with what he was doing with his divisions that I decided to join that team," Bradshaw said after the ceremony. "I never started out to be an administrator. I got involved in EMS purely out of selfish reasons, because my wife and I were expecting our first child. I wanted to know some basic first aid about how to take care of this kid. From there, I got involved in the local rescue squad, and things just have a way of progressing."
Asked what accomplishments he was most proud of during his time working for the state, Bradshaw deflected credit.
"All too often you hear people say 'I did this. I did that.' What I did was I had the good fortune to be the director of an office that involved a lot of people with high energy," he said. "When I think of the fact that LifeFlight of Maine (a helicopter rescue service) came into being as a licensed service during that time, that we had electronic record work, that we had statewide EMS treatment protocols, it was almost accidental that I happened to be there with a lot of those things."
When accepting the award, Bradshaw also thanked his peers, both for selecting him for the honor and doing what they do.
"Each of you play a role as a mentor to somebody, and for that, thank you," he said. "Whether it's as a parent or a spouse, just for whatever support you give. It means a great deal to the EMS system that you're a part of it and that you're here today to join in the celebration."

Texto completo:   Regional goverment officials, Amtrak and the local business are discussing the current state of passenger rail service in Maine, the economic benefits of the service and what the next steps are in the process of securing it.
Group aims to return passenger service
AUGUSTA -- From the outset of Tuesday's Maine passenger rail meeting, Richard Rudolph, of the Maine Rail Group, was clear about what he wanted -- support to form a stakeholders group charged with doing whatever it can to return passenger rail service to central Maine, particularly by identifying the potential economic benefits.
At the close of the three-hour summit that drew business and economic development officials from across central Maine and beyond, he said he felt certain he had gotten the support he was looking for.
But that might be the easiest accomplishment on what promises to be a complicated journey.
For as clearly as Rudolph and Jack Sutton, also of the Maine Rail Group, can see the economic development promise of passenger rail service, others can see hurdles, and chief among them is the difficulty in securing funds for transportation infrastructure that's costly to build and maintain.
Passenger rail service, in the form of the Downeaster, connects coastal Maine cities and towns from Brunswick south to Boston with daily round-trip service. State lawmakers have approved $400,000 in funding, matched by $50,000 each from Lewiston and Auburn, to examine the economic effects of a passenger rail line that links those communities to Portland.
While city officials in both Augusta and Waterville have voted to show their support to consider the return of rail service to those cities, that's only a very early step.
"The people in Lewiston and Auburn already have money to look at this," Rudolph said. "We're better off having a more focused group look at train service to Augusta and beyond, maybe to Bangor, and to Rockland, too, if they want."
He said he's not interested in pitting communities interested in rail service against each other.
"I want to see all boats rise together," he said.
Patricia Quinn, executive director of the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority, which operates the Downeaster, gave a brief update.
"Last year was the first year that ridership was down," Quinn said, attributing that decline to bad weather and construction caused 550 trains to be canceled. Also contributing to lower ridership numbers was the historic drop in the price of gasoline, she said. When gas prices go down, ridership softens.
"But now," she said, "ridership is increasing, on-time performance is increasing and ridership satisfaction is up."
In an interview, Quinn said more delays are expected later this year as a construction project to replace ties is anticipated to interrupt service for about six weeks from mid-October to Thanksgiving. But when it's complete, the Downeaster will be able to add a sixth round trip between Maine and Boston.
To the group assembled at the summit, she said she also was serving as the group's reality check.
"It takes a lot of time, effort and money and people to ride trains," she said.
For the first time since the Downeaster started operating in 2001, she said, the Downeaster and NNEPRA is now facing organized opposition.
"It's important not to put what we have done in jeopardy," she said.
The authority, which was created by the Legislature in 1995, has drawn criticism from residents in Brunswick, where an Amtrak layover facility was proposed where trains could be parked overnight. Residents unsuccessfully challenged the plan on grounds that it would be noisy and disruptive to the residential neighborhood the facility would border.
A little more than a year ago, a legislative committee voted unanimously to seek an audit of NNEPRA by the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, in response to concerns raised by critics of the agency's transparency. The quasi-governmental organization receives $10 million in taxpayer funds annually; $2 million comes from the state of Maine.
Quinn said she's spent a lot of time in a lot of meetings held by groups interested in expanding rail service.
"You have to bring something to the table other than random thoughts," she said. "It's not an inexpensive business. You have to have a goal. You have to know who is going to ride the train. Where will they go? When will they go? It's a volume business, and you have to have critical mass."
Leaders at chambers of commerce and economic development organizations identified a wide range of possible economic opportunities to bringing rail service to central Maine, including additional shopping and tourism opportunities, transportation to health care facilities, transportation to colleges and universities, and visits to friends and family. They also see potential in the twin demographic trends affecting Maine -- older residents wishing to give up their cars and younger residents, in the millennial generation, not wishing to own cars or drive them.
Patrick Wright, economic development coordinator for Gardiner, injected this note of caution: "In my experience in community and economic development, I don't see train service as the big fix. It doesn't create economic development; it reflects it. So other strategies you have will work hand in glove with rail service."
"It doesn't matter which route is chosen," Sutton said. "The important thing is to get a system up and running as fast as possible."
Decisions such as those involved in running a line and managing passengers can't be made individually or in a vacuum, he said. If Lewiston and Auburn are successful in securing rail service, he said, it will bring along the other projects.

Texto completo:   Maine tourism industry expected to benefit, as gas prices lower than last year
With gasoline prices down over last summer, Americans are planning to hit the road this summer, which is good news for the Maine tourism industry.
In a survey of more than 65,000 of its members, GasBuddy, a website and smartphone app that helps consumers find cheap gas, found that more than 75 percent were planning to travel this summer, up 2.2 percent from last year. Not surprisingly, 79 percent of respondents planned to travel by car, according to the company's annual summer travel study.
The local chapter of the American Automobile Association, AAA Northern New England, will issue its travel forecast Thursday, but spokesman Patrick Moody agreed that gas prices that are lower than last summer probably will spur an increase in people driving to Maine for day trips and overnight vacations.
Maine's current price is $2.30 per gallon, according to AAA -- close to the 2016 high, but 35 cents lower than the $2.65 per gallon of a year ago. Portland prices are about a penny more.
"Low gas prices are good news for Maine tourism," said Jennifer Geiger, of the state Office of Tourism. "We are a drive-to destination, with 75 percent of our visitors arriving by car. Our research shows that scenic touring is one of the top-rated activities for Maine, so low gas prices could certainly mean a boost."
Geiger didn't have any hard data on Memorial Day weekend or early season reservations, but she said hoteliers are telling the office unofficially that bookings are strong.
"Motorists will be filling up their tanks with the cheapest summer gasoline since 2005, and we are finding that more people than ever will be taking advantage by hitting the road," said Patrick DeHaan, GasBuddy petroleum analyst. "Nationally, we'll be saving $2.6 billion over the long weekend versus the highest-priced Memorial Day weekend in 2011."
The GasBuddy survey found that more people are traveling for leisure than obligation, with 53 percent traveling to relax and take in local culture compared to 51 percent last year.
The survey also found 56 percent of travelers who participated in the national survey plan to drive at least 400 miles round trip, 36 percent are planning at least two summer road trips in 2016 and day trips are up 4 percent.
State officials hope to build on last year's strong season. Maine enjoyed a 4 percent increase in overnight stays and 4.6 percent increase in day visits in 2015 over the previous year, Geiger said. While the summer remained the height of the season, drawing 24.3 million of the state's 33.9 million annual visitors, Maine saw a big increase in fall visits, with 12.8 percent more travelers in September, October and November than in 2014, according to state data.
A strong summer season would be good news for the state's 1,000 gas stations, but not necessarily for the reason you would think.
The owners of gas stations make their money off the food, drinks and alcohol they sell in their convenience stores, not from the small percentage of what they earn off gas sales at the pump, said Jamie Py, head of Maine Energy Marketers Association, a gas station trade group that represents about 120 state petroleum retailers.
Vacationing drivers are more likely to step inside the store and buy products with a good profit margin for the Shell or Mobil franchisee than someone fueling up on a daily commute to work, Py said. Maine franchisees really need that boost this summer because they are coming off a bad winter season, when warm weather hurt their traditionally strong sales to snowmobilers, Py said.
It's still too early to tell where gas prices may head over the summer, Moody said. Gas prices can fluctuate because of unpredictable factors, such as hurricanes on the Gulf Coast and foreign unrest. But demand for gas leading into the summer driving season often pushes prices up -- crude oil prices are nearing $50 a barrel this week -- and it's likely that prices are heading for a new 2016 high in the coming days, Moody said.
For consumers in Maine and across most of the country, ahowever, prices are still lower now than they were a year ago, Moody noted. The average price per gallon nationally is $2.22, a bump of 11 cents month over month but still 48 cents less per gallon now than one year ago, according to a national AAA report issued Monday.

Texto completo:   Several communities are putting off large-scale municipal power projects
Several Maine communities are reconsidering or shelving plans to build large-scale solar energy projects in the aftermath of a failed bid to reform Maine's solar regulations.
A handful of cities and towns, including Falmouth, Portland, South Portland and Rockland, were planning to install photoelectric panels on top of capped landfills that otherwise have no use. The installations could provide renewable power to municipal buildings, schools, streetlights and reduce municipal electricity costs.
The projects appealed to residents who want to reduce carbon emissions. Private solar developers were expected to invest millions of dollars to build the arrays.
However, the projects needed the Legislature to change the way solar producers are compensated for the power they generate and allow larger projects to offset their construction costs. Gov. Paul LePage vetoed that legislation last month, and the state's Public Utilities Commission soon will consider whether to change the existing system for crediting small-scale solar power generators who feed energy back into the grid. The regulatory challenges and uncertainty about the future have stopped at least one municipal solar project before it got off the ground, and threw others into limbo.
Cumberland canceled a presentation last week from TRC Engineers about a planned solar project on its landfill, citing uncertainty with state rules. "I did explain to the council that without the state support, solar farms may not be possible," Town Manager Bill Shane wrote in an email to TRC immediately after the bill died.
Rockland also was in the screening process for solar sites, but it probably won't go anywhere now, City Councilor Larry Pritchett said.
"Certainly any project that would go forward now would be less attractive than one that would have been permitted under the proposed rules," Pritchett said.
Officials in some of the communities said the veto and failed override effort won't necessarily end their quests for landfill solar projects, but will at least delay and complicate them.
"The bill would have removed some of the barriers that constrict the projects. We can work around it, but it is more difficult," said Julie Rosenbach, South Portland's sustainability coordinator.
Municipal solar projects rely on private developers to construct the arrays and sell the power to the municipality for about six years, when the community purchases the installation and begins to produce its own power. It would take more than a decade to pay off a system, but when it did, the municipality would be producing its own power for free.
The ability to make money on excess power has been a key part of the plans.
Right now, small-scale solar power generators can get a one-to-one credit for the excess power they generate and deliver back to the grid, something called net metering. Customers can offset their electricity bills with the credits and use the money saved to pay down the cost to install solar equipment.
However, the credits are limited to relatively small power generators and don't match up well with the larger-scale municipal projects.
State policy restricts the size of installations eligible for net metering to 660 kilowatts and allows solar farms to feed only 10 meters at a time. Additionally, large electricity users such as water treatment plants cannot offset their power charges with electricity credits.
The failed solar bill, L.D. 1649, would have changed those rules as part of an effort to dramatically increase the amount of solar-generated electricity in Maine from 18 megawatts to 250 megawatts in five years. According to the national Solar Energy Industries Association, 250 megawatts of power is enough to power about 41,000 homes.
The bill would have replaced electricity credits with long-term, fixed-price contracts for solar power that would provide solar-generating customers with money to pay down their costs. The bill also increased the cap on solar projects to 2,000 kilowatts and eliminated the restriction of 10 meters per installation.
It was developed during a nearly yearlong stakeholder process and endorsed by solar developers, the state's power companies, environmentalists and others. But it was opposed by Gov. LePage and Republicans in the Legislature, who argued the plan would provide a subsidy to solar customers and raise the cost of electricity for other ratepayers.
The bill was killed last month after the House of Representatives fell two votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed to override LePage's veto.
In the aftermath, the Maine Public Utilities Commission is moving ahead with a separate review of the state's net metering policy, and some solar developers worry that it will change the credit system and make solar power less attractive. Some fear the commission could follow the path taken by Nevada, which this year increased charges and decreased credits for solar users, thereby eliminating the incentive for installing solar.
PUC Executive Director Harry Lanphear said in an email that commissioners will start the net metering review in the near future, likely this summer, and would consider input from all interested parties. "The outcome of this process may address the issue of customers with existing net energy billing contracts, as well as customers who enter into new net energy billing contracts," he said.
Officials in the communities pursuing solar projects are among those waiting and watching.
Falmouth hoped to put a solar array out to bid this summer and already had conducted engineering and feasibility studies for a solar farm that would cap its landfill and generate up to 25 percent of the town's power. Those plans have been shelved until state rules get cleared up, said Nathan Poore, Falmouth's town manager.
"We would have most definitely had a viable project if (the bill) had passed, but now it is much less viable," Poore said. "I still have confidence that someday we are going to have solar on that landfill. It is just not going to happen as soon as we would like."
The town still might pursue a landfill or rooftop solar project, but it will likely be much smaller because of the limit of 10 users, or accounts.
A joint Portland-South Portland proposal to build twin 660-kilowatt arrays, costing $2.5 million each, on the cities' capped landfills and four rooftop arrays on Portland buildings, also may be reconsidered. The project would have produced around 3.5 percent of Portland's power, and roughly 12 percent of South Portland's power.
"Our basic goal is to offset our energy use with clean, renewable energy. We have this awesome resource that is open space in our landfill that you can't use for anything else," said Rosenbach, the South Portland sustainabilty coordinator.
South Portland already has put a solar array on its planning office, among other eco-friendly projects, and viewed the landfill project as the next step. "The thing is, we are really interested in doing solar. We just have to weigh the risks of moving forward in an uncharted climate right now," Rosenbach said.
The legislative defeat hasn't halted all solar power development in Maine.
While the atmosphere isn't attractive for municipal solar projects, colleges such as Bowdoin and Colby have invested in solar systems that send electricity directly to their buildings, without going through the grid and relying on net metering credits. Madison Electric is building a large system to make power for its customers. Ranger Solar, a Yarmouth company, plans to construct a 50-megawatt installation at the Sanford airport to sell power directly to private clients.
The difference is those projects don't rely on credits or excess power revenue to be viable.
Advocates of the solar bill said Maine's rules suppress the solar industry's growth in the state, including the development of municipal projects, and argue that Maine lags far behind other New England states in solar development.
Nearly every municipality in Massachusetts hosts a solar project, and that state's Legislature recently increased a cap on net metering, allowing more large-scale projects to move ahead, according to the Massachusetts Municipal Association. The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources even publishes a 42-page guide specifically for developing solar on capped landfills.
Municipal projects in Maine, by contrast, have been small rooftop solar installations.
The Maine Municipal Association has estimated there are 1,800 acres of capped landfills in the state. If 40 percent of that acreage was developed for solar, the landfills could generate electricity equivalent to $25 million in costs currently being paid by towns and cities in power bills, the association estimates.
Maine does have one landfill solar development.
Belfast, which lies next to Penobscot Bay, has a 396-panel array constructed and operated by ReVision Solar, a leading solar installer in Maine.
Sadie Lloyd, Belfast's assistant city planner, said the array is capable of producing 120 kilowatts and when combined with panels on the fire station roof provides roughly 20 percent of the city's energy needs.
"To be able to offset our electricity bill by 20 percent is a big deal," Lloyd said.
The project is tiny compared to other municipal proposals and did not rely on passage of the legislation. But the town is now hoping that net metering credits aren't changed in a way that affects the town's solar project.
"Hopefully they keep some form of net metering, because for a municipality, it is a real advantage," Lloyd said.

Texto completo:   Jay Bradshaw of Belgrade, former director of Maine EMS, is among the EMS providers who will be honored at the State House Tuesday as part of the annual State EMS Awards. Jay will be receiving the governor's award.
AUGUSTA -- Jay Bradshaw, former chief of the Winthrop Ambulance Service who went on to lead Maine's bureau of emergency medical services, was among those recognized Tuesday at an annual awards ceremony to honor all men and women who pick up the phone, day or night, when Mainers are in desperate need of medical attention.
About 100 people attended the event in the State House Hall of Flags.
Among those celebrated were paramedics, emergency medical technicians, physicians, rescue services and a health center, each from different parts of the state.
Following the ceremony, wreaths were laid outside the State House to commemorate eight emergency service providers from Maine who have died in the line of duty. The most recent of those deceased was Peter Larlee of East Millinocket, who had a heart attack following an emergency call on March 2.
Bradshaw, of Belgrade, took home the largest hardware of the day. He retired last year after 28 years working for the state, the majority as director of emergency medical services.
For that service, Bradshaw earned the Governor's Award. According to a program for the event, the Governor's Award is "for exceptional contribution to the EMS system at the state, national or system-wide level, with contributions in multiple areas of EMS."
Bradshaw's successor at the helm of the state's emergency medical services, Shaun St. Germain, presented the award and listed several of Bradshaw's accomplishments: implementing statewide training standards, growing the state's emergency medicine system and making Maine's emergency medical services a national model.
In remarks to the audience, Bradshaw thanked those who had served as his mentors, including his predecessor at the state emergency medicine bureau, Kevin McGinnis.
"I was ambulance director in Winthrop when Kevin McGinnis became state EMS director, and I was so impressed with what he was doing with his divisions that I decided to join that team," Bradshaw said after the ceremony. "I never started out to be an administrator. I got involved in EMS purely out of selfish reasons, because my wife and I were expecting our first child. I wanted to know some basic first aid about how to take care of this kid. From there, I got involved in the local rescue squad, and things just have a way of progressing."
Asked what accomplishments he was most proud of during his time working for the state, Bradshaw deflected credit.
"All too often you hear people say 'I did this. I did that.' What I did was I had the good fortune to be the director of an office that involved a lot of people with high energy," he said. "When I think of the fact that LifeFlight of Maine (a helicopter rescue service) came into being as a licensed service during that time, that we had electronic record work, that we had statewide EMS treatment protocols, it was almost accidental that I happened to be there with a lot of those things."
When accepting the award, Bradshaw also thanked his peers, both for selecting him for the honor and doing what they do.
"Each of you play a role as a mentor to somebody, and for that, thank you," he said. "Whether it's as a parent or a spouse, just for whatever support you give. It means a great deal to the EMS system that you're a part of it and that you're here today to join in the celebration."

Texto completo:   Boy Scout chaperone from Mass. fell out of raft in West Forks on Dead River
North Country Rivers was operating a commercial rafting trip in accordance with state law on Saturday when a Massachusetts man who was a Boy Scout chaperone fell out and died, the Maine Warden Service said.
In a news release Tuesday, the warden service said the fatal rafting accident in West Forks Plantation was "a rare incident involving Maine's whitewater rafting industry, as it has been several years since a fatality has occurred."
Michael Arena, 52, of Lexington, Massachusetts, was on a commercial rafting trip with North Country Rivers, a whitewater rafting outfitter out of Bingham, when he fell out of the raft as it was going through a series of whitewater rapids on the Dead River. The warden service responded to a report of an unresponsive man about 2 p.m.
Arena was a chaperone with a group of four Boy Scouts, one of whom was his son, according to the warden service.
There were seven people in the raft, including a guide, two chaperones and four teenage boys, the service said.
Upper Kennebec Valley Ambulance pronounced Arena dead at the scene. The warden service said Tuesday that Arena's cause of death has not yet been determined.
Sgt. Chris Simmons, with the Maine Warden Service, told WickedLocal.com of Lexington, Massachusetts, that Arena likely drowned as he was pushed under strong turbulent waves.
Reached by phone Tuesday, Jim Murton, the owner of North Country Rivers, declined comment. On Monday, Murton would only say that "the rafting trips are safe. There are no problems at all with the trips. It was an accident."
Hank Manz, the scoutmaster for Troop 160 in Lexington, Massachusetts, said Tuesday he didn't know additional details of the accident -- he was not on the trip -- and he intentionally has not questioned anyone from the troop involved in the trip, in order to "let the authorities do their investigation."
Manz called the incident an "incredible tragedy."
"Here at the local level, we are focused on support of the Arena family and the Scouts and adults on the trip," Manz said. "The first thing we want to do is minimize anymore upheaval and pressure in their lives."
The warden service said nearly 70,000 people commercially raft Maine's rivers each year.
Cpl. John MacDonald, a warden service spokesman, did not immediately respond to a call Tuesday seeking further comment.
Manz said that about a dozen Scouts and six adults traveled to Maine for the rafting trip. He wasn't sure if they had previously used the services of North Country Rivers. "We do some sort of outdoor trip every month, and most Scout troops do that, and we have certainly done whitewater rafting before," he said.
Troop 160 has more than 80 Scouts and many adult volunteers and chaperones like Arena who "are a huge part of making Scouting available," Manz said.
Manz declined to talk about Arena personally, saying that was more appropriate for family members, who were not available for comment.

Texto completo:   Several communities postponing large-scale municipal power projects
Several Maine communities are reconsidering or shelving plans to build large-scale solar energy projects in the aftermath of a failed bid to reform Maine's solar regulations.
A handful of cities and towns, including Falmouth, Portland, South Portland and Rockland, were planning to install photoelectric panels on top of capped landfills that otherwise have no use. The installations could provide renewable power to municipal buildings, schools, streetlights and reduce municipal electricity costs.
The projects appealed to residents who want to reduce carbon emissions. Private solar developers were expected to invest millions of dollars to build the arrays.
However, the projects needed the Legislature to change the way solar producers are compensated for the power they generate and allow larger projects to offset their construction costs. Gov. Paul LePage vetoed that legislation last month, and the state's Public Utilities Commission soon will consider whether to change the existing system for crediting small-scale solar power generators who feed energy back into the grid. The regulatory challenges and uncertainty about the future have stopped at least one municipal solar project before it got off the ground, and threw others into limbo.
Cumberland canceled a presentation last week from TRC Engineers about a planned solar project on its landfill, citing uncertainty with state rules. "I did explain to the council that without the state support, solar farms may not be possible," Town Manager Bill Shane wrote in an email to TRC immediately after the bill died.
Rockland also was in the screening process for solar sites, but it probably won't go anywhere now, City Councilor Larry Pritchett said.
"Certainly any project that would go forward now would be less attractive than one that would have been permitted under the proposed rules," Pritchett said.
Officials in some of the communities said the veto and failed override effort won't necessarily end their quests for landfill solar projects, but will at least delay and complicate them.
"The bill would have removed some of the barriers that constrict the projects. We can work around it, but it is more difficult," said Julie Rosenbach, South Portland's sustainability coordinator.
Municipal solar projects rely on private developers to construct the arrays and sell the power to the municipality for about six years, when the community purchases the installation and begins to produce its own power. It would take more than a decade to pay off a system, but when it did, the municipality would be producing its own power for free.
The ability to make money on excess power has been a key part of the plans.
Right now, small-scale solar power generators can get a one-to-one credit for the excess power they generate and deliver back to the grid, something called net metering. Customers can offset their electricity bills with the credits and use the money saved to pay down the cost to install solar equipment.
However, the credits are limited to relatively small power generators and don't match up well with the larger-scale municipal projects.
State policy restricts the size of installations eligible for net metering to 660 kilowatts and allows solar farms to feed only 10 meters at a time. Additionally, large electricity users such as water treatment plants cannot offset their power charges with electricity credits.
The failed solar bill, L.D. 1649, would have changed those rules as part of an effort to dramatically increase the amount of solar-generated electricity in Maine from 18 megawatts to 250 megawatts in five years. According to the national Solar Energy Industries Association, 250 megawatts of power is enough to power about 41,000 homes.
The bill would have replaced electricity credits with long-term, fixed-price contracts for solar power that would provide solar-generating customers with money to pay down their costs. The bill also increased the cap on solar projects to 2,000 kilowatts and eliminated the restriction of 10 meters per installation.
It was developed during a nearly yearlong stakeholder process and endorsed by solar developers, the state's power companies, environmentalists and others. But it was opposed by Gov. LePage and Republicans in the Legislature, who argued the plan would provide a subsidy to solar customers and raise the cost of electricity for other ratepayers.
The bill was killed last month after the House of Representatives fell two votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed to override LePage's veto.
In the aftermath, the Maine Public Utilities Commission is moving ahead with a separate review of the state's net metering policy, and some solar developers worry that it will change the credit system and make solar power less attractive. Some fear the commission could follow the path taken by Nevada, which this year increased charges and decreased credits for solar users, thereby eliminating the incentive for installing solar.
PUC Executive Director Harry Lanphear said in an email that commissioners will start the net metering review in the near future, likely this summer, and would consider input from all interested parties. "The outcome of this process may address the issue of customers with existing net energy billing contracts, as well as customers who enter into new net energy billing contracts," he said.
Officials in the communities pursuing solar projects are among those waiting and watching.
Falmouth hoped to put a solar array out to bid this summer and already had conducted engineering and feasibility studies for a solar farm that would cap its landfill and generate up to 25 percent of the town's power. Those plans have been shelved until state rules get cleared up, said Nathan Poore, Falmouth's town manager.
"We would have most definitely had a viable project if (the bill) had passed, but now it is much less viable," Poore said. "I still have confidence that someday we are going to have solar on that landfill. It is just not going to happen as soon as we would like."
The town still might pursue a landfill or rooftop solar project, but it will likely be much smaller because of the limit of 10 users, or accounts.
A joint Portland-South Portland proposal to build twin 660-kilowatt arrays, costing $2.5 million each, on the cities' capped landfills and four rooftop arrays on Portland buildings, also may be reconsidered. The project would have produced around 3.5 percent of Portland's power, and roughly 12 percent of South Portland's power.
"Our basic goal is to offset our energy use with clean, renewable energy. We have this awesome resource that is open space in our landfill that you can't use for anything else," said Rosenbach, the South Portland sustainabilty coordinator.
South Portland already has put a solar array on its planning office, among other eco-friendly projects, and viewed the landfill project as the next step. "The thing is, we are really interested in doing solar. We just have to weigh the risks of moving forward in an uncharted climate right now," Rosenbach said.
The legislative defeat hasn't halted all solar power development in Maine.
While the atmosphere isn't attractive for municipal solar projects, colleges such as Bowdoin and Colby have invested in solar systems that send electricity directly to their buildings, without going through the grid and relying on net metering credits. Madison Electric is building a large system to make power for its customers. Ranger Solar, a Yarmouth company, plans to construct a 50-megawatt installation at the Sanford airport to sell power directly to private clients.
The difference is those projects don't rely on credits or excess power revenue to be viable.
Advocates of the solar bill said Maine's rules suppress the solar industry's growth in the state, including the development of municipal projects, and argue that Maine lags far behind other New England states in solar development.
Nearly every municipality in Massachusetts hosts a solar project, and that state's Legislature recently increased a cap on net metering, allowing more large-scale projects to move ahead, according to the Massachusetts Municipal Association. The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources even publishes a 42-page guide specifically for developing solar on capped landfills.
Municipal projects in Maine, by contrast, have been small rooftop solar installations.
The Maine Municipal Association has estimated there are 1,800 acres of capped landfills in the state. If 40 percent of that acreage was developed for solar, the landfills could generate electricity equivalent to $25 million in costs currently being paid by towns and cities in power bills, the association estimates.
Maine does have one landfill solar development.
Belfast, which lies next to Penobscot Bay, has a 396-panel array constructed and operated by ReVision Solar, a leading solar installer in Maine.
Sadie Lloyd, Belfast's assistant city planner, said the array is capable of producing 120 kilowatts and when combined with panels on the fire station roof provides roughly 20 percent of the city's energy needs.
"To be able to offset our electricity bill by 20 percent is a big deal," Lloyd said.
The project is tiny compared to other municipal proposals and did not rely on passage of the legislation. But the town is now hoping that net metering credits aren't changed in a way that affects the town's solar project.
"Hopefully they keep some form of net metering, because for a municipality, it is a real advantage," Lloyd said.

Resumen: The 2010 law requires that "firms performing renovation, repair and painting ... in homes, child care facilities, and kindergartens built before 1978" have to complete an eight-hour certification course on lead-safe practices and undergo hands-on training every five years for recertification.

Texto completo:   Starting next month, the federal Environmental Protection Agency will go after contractors in the Lewiston-Auburn area who aren't following legal requirements for safely removing lead paint from residences, schools and other buildings.
Improper removal of lead paint during renovation is one of the ways lead can poison adults and children. From 2009 to 2014, more than 20 percent of Maine children diagnosed with lead poisoning were from the Lewiston-Auburn area.
Lead poisoning can cause lowered intelligence in children, lifelong behavior or attention problems, hearing deficiencies, kidney damage and slowed body growth.
The EPA action, announced Tuesday, aims first to educate contractors on the agency's lead-safe renovation rules. But then the agency will go into enforcement mode.
"Following outreach efforts in May, over the course of several weeks in June, EPA will conduct inspections of renovation, painting and property management companies in the area to assess compliance" with what is called the Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (or RRP) Rule, the agency said in a statement Tuesday.
The 2010 law requires that "firms performing renovation, repair and painting ... in homes, child care facilities, and kindergartens built before 1978" have to complete an eight-hour certification course on lead-safe practices and undergo hands-on training every five years for recertification. Contractors must then use those lead-safe practices on the job or face fines of up to $37,000 per day for violations.
Although Maine has contacted contractors and landlords to get them to attend the course, the EPA's list of certified renovators in the state had only 1,160 names on it as of late 2015.
The EPA pursued only three enforcement actions under the law in Maine from 2010 to August 2015, and only 20 throughout New England during that period.
Sharon Hayes, the regional EPA staff member in Boston in charge of enforcing the law, admitted in 2015 to the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting that her agency was unable to comprehensively enforce it. "This is absolutely a national problem. There's not enough resources to do it adequately," said Hayes.
"I'm sure we're missing cases everywhere, not just Maine."
The agency, Hayes said, instead is focusing on high-profile enforcement actions in specific cities with high childhood lead poisoning rates.
The EPA mounted two such actions in recent years, one in New Haven, Conn., and the other in Nashua, N.H. In New Haven, the agency said it completed a total of 65 inspections, 40 companies got formal certification to conduct lead-safe work and six companies were hit with enforcement actions that resulted in fines. Those companies, said the EPA, ultimately complied with the standards.
Now, the agency is turning its attention to Lewiston and Auburn, where children get lead poisoning at three times the rate of the rest of the state. The problem particularly affects the two cities' poor children and Somali immigrant children, who represent a high proportion of residents in the downtown, where much of the housing is old and lead paint is common.
While lead poisoning cases have gone down dramatically in the past 20 years in Bangor, Portland, Saco, Biddeford and Sanford, the rates of childhood lead poisoning in Lewiston and Auburn have remained high. From 2009 to 2014, there were 467 Maine children identified as lead poisoned and 97 were from the Lewiston-Auburn area.
"Children's exposure to lead continues to be a significant health concern here in New England," Curt Spalding, the EPA's New England regional administrator, said Tuesday. "This is especially true for kids who live in underprivileged areas and other places where there is a large amount of older housing stock that hasn't been renovated and lead paint has not been removed.
"Our initiative in Lewiston/Auburn is designed such that EPA will work closely with our local, state and federal partners to address a serious public health problem affecting children," he added.
A combination of federal and state laws is supposed to prevent children from getting poisoned by lead. But Maine has long lagged in its own efforts to prevent childhood lead poisoning from chipping and peeling lead paint in old buildings.
A 2015 investigation by the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting found that five years after the state-adopted 2010 deadline to eradicate childhood lead poisoning, thousands of Maine children were still being poisoned by licking surfaces covered with lead paint dust, licking their fingers after touching lead dust or breathing in the lead dust in the air around their homes.

Texto completo:   The Bath Police Department is warning people about the arrival of a Florida gang that likes to break into vehicles operated by women.
A gang of thieves who specialize in breaking into cars and stealing the driver's licenses, personal checks and debit cards of women has arrived in Maine, at least two police departments are warning.
The Bath Police Department posted a warning Tuesday on its Facebook page about the "Felony Lane Gang," a loosely organized group of criminals from Florida who target vehicles parked at gyms, fitness centers, parks and day care centers.
The Winslow Police Department posted a warning on its Facebook page Monday.
Bath police Detective Marc Brunelle said he has seen evidence that the gang may have recently started operating in the midcoast area.
"We can't pinpoint where they are, but we have investigated a couple of break-ins in this area," Brunelle said Tuesday evening. "The best thing people can do to help us is to lock your cars and hide your valuables."
Bath police said the gang, which originated in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, several years ago, has been known to recruit local women who resemble their victims to cash checks. The women also wear wigs and use makeup to enhance the resemblance.
The local operatives drive rental cars with tinted windows and fake or stolen license plates when they go to a financial institution to cash a check.
Law enforcement agencies across the U.S. call them the Felony Lane Gang because its members prefer to use the drive-up lane farthest from the sight of a teller in an attempt to avoid detection.
A group of victims calling itself the Felony Lane Gang Task Force maintains a Facebook page to raise awareness about the criminal operation. On the page there is a map of the U.S. identifying locations where the gang has been active. In the corner of the map is a tagline that reads: "Felony Lane Gang. Targeting Moms."
According to the task force, the Felony Lane Gang "has been operating for years, raking in millions of dollars with criminal activity that crosses multiple state lines. Up until recent months, many of these cases were filed away as local burglaries and the bigger picture was missed entirely. These cases are connected ... very well connected and this page is working hard to put the puzzle pieces together."
The task force says the gang likes to target vehicles operated by women because it believes there is an increased chance of finding an unattended purse.
Gang members conduct surveillance on cars left at gyms, parks, day care centers and sporting events and enter unlocked vehicles or locked vehicle by using a window punch to break the glass. The gang recruits local women - mostly prostitutes or drug addicts - to cash stolen checks.
Detective Brunelle said there is no particular reason he is aware of that the gang would come to Maine.
"They like to move around especially when they feel law enforcement is getting too close," Brunelle said. "I think it's more of a natural progression."
Brunelle said local fitness clubs, including the Bath Area Family YMCA, have been made aware of the gang's presence.
"In the past, YMCA parking lots have been hit by this group," the Bath YMCA said in a warning posted on its Facebook page. "Just a reminder to keep your valuables at home, with you, or locked for safety."
Bath police are urging residents not to confront gang members and to report all suspicious activity to the police department. Dennis Hoey can be contacted at 791-6365 or at: dhoey@pressherald.com

Texto completo:   A spectacular meteor filled the night sky with light early Tuesday, providing 'an amazing experience' for those in the Northeast lucky enough to witness it.
Portland police Sgt. Tim Farris was on patrol early Tuesday when he witnessed a speeder he never expected: a spectacular fiery streak that lit up the night sky.
The streak was the apparent trail of a meteor burning up as it passed through the Earth's atmosphere at about 12:50 a.m.
Farris was parked in front of the Central Fire Station on Congress Street watching for speeders at the time, and his cruiser's dashcam captured the fireball streaking across the sky behind Franklin Towers. The video was posted on the department's Facebook page Tuesday.
Over in Cumberland, Officer Scott Hendee was on patrol when his dashcam recorded the fireball lighting up the sky.
"Unfortunately, the fireball and large flame trail were just out of the camera's frame," the department wrote on its Facebook page. "It was the most impressive one we've ever seen!"
The American Meteor Society shared the Portland police video on its website, generating so much traffic it apparently caused the site to crash Tuesday morning. A map posted by the society showed clusters of reports of meteor sightings throughout the Northeast, but most occurred in coastal Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut. A total of 516 sightings from Canada to New Jersey had been reported as of 6 p.m. Tuesday.
"The fireball was seen primarily from Maine, but witnesses from Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Connecticut (and the Canadian provinces of) Ontario and Quebec also reported the event," the society said on its website.
The society described the meteor as "an amazing experience for witnesses."
"There was a 3- to 5-minute delay from the time I saw it to the boom I heard and felt, very loud and shook the home, unlike anything I have ever experienced before," Craig C. of Canton, Maine, wrote in a comment posted on the society's website.
The society's Facebook page also had comments from people in Canton and Rumford who had seen and heard the meteor.
The society is asking anyone who saw the meteor to fill out an official "fireball report" through its website.
A meteor is the flash of light emitted by a small chunk of interplanetary debris, or meteoroid, as it burns up while passing through the Earth's atmosphere, the meteor society website says. A meteoroid that survives its passage through the atmosphere and strikes the ground is a meteorite.
Most meteors become visible while passing through the region of the atmosphere called the thermosphere. This "meteoric region" is between 50 miles and 75 miles in altitude. Most meteoroids, which can vary in size from small grains to 1 meter wide, enter the atmosphere at speeds ranging from 25,000 mph to 160,000 mph, according to the meteor society.
The society's website said the meteor spotted in the Northeast early Tuesday was a fireball, the term given to a meteor that is brighter than the planet Venus in the morning or evening sky. Several thousand meteors of fireball magnitude occur in the Earth's atmosphere each day, but the vast majority occur over oceans or uninhabited regions and many are masked by daylight, the website said.
For many of the people who filed a report on the society's website, seeing the fireball was a first-time experience. An observation report filed by Joe S. of Gorham described it as a "once-in-a-lifetime event thus far" and "somewhat terrifying."
"The fireball looked like it had lightning bolts in the middle of it as it came closer to the horizon," Joe S. wrote. "As it approached the horizon the entire sky turned white as if lightning struck close by."
'THE MOST STUNNING SKY EVENT'
Another Maine man, Armando M. of Lewiston, filed a report with the society that described the fireball as white with blue and orange streaks.
"I have seen two fireballs in my lifetime and, as a physics major and amateur astronomer, this was the most stunning sky event I have ever seen," he wrote.
Barbra Barrett, director of the Maine Mineral and Gem Museum in Bethel, said that based on the eyewitness accounts it collected, the meteor society mapped a trajectory for the meteoroid that shows it appeared to have entered the Earth's atmosphere over Maine, and its "terminal explosion" occurred about 30 kilometers west of Rangeley in Franklin County.
Barrett would like people who witnessed the meteor to contact her with information about what they saw, heard or felt. She's hoping the witness accounts could help identify where the meteoroid would have landed - if it didn't disintegrate during its trip through the atmosphere - so it could be recovered and included in the museum's extensive display of meteorites from around the world. She said it is rare for a meteorite to be found in Maine, because most fall in wooded areas or in the water.
"I think there's a real possibility here to recover the meteorite," Barrett said. "It's a unique opportunity for Maine to see and possibly recover a meteorite after seeing a fireball in the sky."
The meteor sighting in Maine is particularly timely for officials from the mineral museum, who met last week with consultants about establishing the Maine Fireball Network. The museum will set up special cameras throughout the state which, when used together, can determine the speed and trajectory of a fireball and assist in the recovery of meteorite fragments, Barrett said. She said it will be the first major network in New England.
"While we wish we were already operational, I'm just glad this didn't happen last week as it would have been one heck of a distraction," Barrett said. "We are very excited."
MUSEUM OFFERS $20,000 REWARD
Anyone who saw the meteor Tuesday morning and wants to share information can contact Barrett at bbarrett@mainemineralmuseum.org or 824-3036. She said the museum will offer a $20,000 reward if a one-kilogram meteorite is recovered. It would receive a place of honor in the museum's Meteorite Hall.
The Portland Police Department's video had more than 151,000 views and more than 400 comments by Tuesday afternoon.
"You never know what you are going to see on duty. Sgt. Farris was looking for speeders while parked in front of the Central Fire Station and was able to observe some visitors 'from away' ... far away. The meteor (or alien spaceship) was caught on camera at approximately 0050 hours," the police department wrote in its post. "Let's hope the visitors are friendly. They could just be some of Stephen King's friends on their way to visit him. Whomever they are, I'm sure we could win them over with a whoopie pie. P.S. The voice on the video stating, "Oh my God!" is from (Officer Graham) Hults. Apparently he was amazed."

EPA targets Lewiston area to enforce safe lead removal

Resumen: The 2010 law requires that "firms performing renovation, repair and painting ... in homes, child care facilities, and kindergartens built before 1978" have to complete an eight-hour certification course on lead-safe practices and undergo hands-on training every five years for recertification.

Texto completo:   Starting next month, the federal Environmental Protection Agency will go after contractors in the Lewiston-Auburn area who aren't following legal requirements for safely removing lead paint from residences, schools and other buildings.
Improper removal of lead paint during renovation is one of the ways lead can poison adults and children. From 2009 to 2014, more than 20 percent of Maine children diagnosed with lead poisoning were from the Lewiston-Auburn area.
Lead poisoning can cause lowered intelligence in children, lifelong behavior or attention problems, hearing deficiencies, kidney damage and slowed body growth.
The EPA action, announced Tuesday, aims first to educate contractors on the agency's lead-safe renovation rules. But then the agency will go into enforcement mode.
"Following outreach efforts in May, over the course of several weeks in June, EPA will conduct inspections of renovation, painting and property management companies in the area to assess compliance" with what is called the Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (or RRP) Rule, the agency said in a statement Tuesday.
The 2010 law requires that "firms performing renovation, repair and painting ... in homes, child care facilities, and kindergartens built before 1978" have to complete an eight-hour certification course on lead-safe practices and undergo hands-on training every five years for recertification. Contractors must then use those lead-safe practices on the job or face fines of up to $37,000 per day for violations.
Although Maine has contacted contractors and landlords to get them to attend the course, the EPA's list of certified renovators in the state had only 1,160 names on it as of late 2015. There are 4,700 construction firms in the state, according to the U S. Census.
The EPA pursued only three enforcement actions under the law in Maine from 2010 to August 2015, and only 20 throughout New England during that period.
Sharon Hayes, the regional EPA staff member in Boston in charge of enforcing the law, admitted in 2015 to the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting that her agency was unable to comprehensively enforce it.
"This is absolutely a national problem, there's not enough resources to do it adequately," said Hayes.
"I'm sure we're missing cases everywhere, not just Maine."
The agency, Hayes said, instead is focusing on high-profile enforcement actions in specific cities with high childhood lead poisoning rates.
The EPA mounted two such actions in recent years, one in New Haven, Conn., and the other in Nashua, N.H. In New Haven, the agency said it completed a total of 65 inspections, 40 companies got formal certification to conduct lead-safe work and six companies were hit with enforcement actions that resulted in fines. Those companies, said the EPA, ultimately complied with the standards.
Now, the agency is turning its attention to Lewiston and Auburn, where children get lead poisoning at three times the rate of the rest of the state. The problem particularly affects the two cities' poor children and Somali immigrant children, who represent a high proportion of residents in the downtown, where much of the housing is old and lead paint is common.
While lead poisoning cases have gone down dramatically in the past 20 years in Bangor, Portland, Saco, Biddeford and Sanford, the rates of childhood lead poisoning in Lewiston and Auburn have remained high. From 2009 to 2014, there were 467 Maine children identified as lead poisoned and 97 were from the Lewiston-Auburn area.
"Children's exposure to lead continues to be a significant health concern here in New England," Curt Spalding, the EPA's New England regional administrator, said Tuesday. "This is especially true for kids who live in underprivileged areas and other places where there is a large amount of older housing stock that hasn't been renovated and lead paint has not been removed.
"Our initiative in Lewiston/Auburn is designed such that EPA will work closely with our local, state and federal partners to address a serious public health problem affecting children," he added.
A combination of federal and state laws is supposed to prevent children from getting poisoned by lead. But Maine has long lagged in its own efforts to prevent childhood lead poisoning from chipping and peeling lead paint in old buildings.
A 2015 investigation by the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting found that five years after the state-adopted 2010 deadline to eradicate childhood lead poisoning, thousands of Maine children were still being poisoned by licking surfaces covered with lead paint dust, licking their fingers after touching lead dust or breathing in the lead dust in the air around their homes.

Absentee ballots for the June 14 state primary were supposed to be available to all voters starting Monday, but there's been a slight delay in some Maine towns as clerks wait for a late shipment from the printer.
The state ballots were supposed to arrive at town and city halls across the state by Saturday, but some clerks say they have yet to receive them. The printer contracted by the state to print the ballots says they have been shipped and all clerks should have them by Wednesday, according to the Maine Secretary of State's Office.
"There's still plenty of time to vote," said Kristen Muszynski, spokeswoman for the secretary of state.
State legislative and congressional primaries will be held in June. There are no referendums on the June ballot.
Kim McLaughlin, the town clerk in Old Orchard Beach, said she's in a bit of a unique situation because she hasn't received state or local ballots from the printers. The printer who does the town's local ballots sent McLaughlin the ballots last week, but they arrived bound in elastics instead of shrink-wrap.
"Some were ripped and some were bent," she said.
Those ballots are being reprinted so they can go through the voting machines without a problem.
"Luckily, not too many people have been requesting ballots yet. At least it isn't happening in the middle of a rush," McLaughlin said.
In Biddeford, City Clerk Carmen Morris received the ballots on Monday and had them mailed out by the end of the day. The ballots arrived in Portland on Tuesday and the city clerk's office there reported that all absentee ballot requests were being filled by the end of the day. The office is also now set up for voters who stop in to fill out an absentee ballot.
Martha Huff, the town clerk in Hollis, hasn't received any sate ballots, but plans to send them out "the minute we get them in." She said she's only received about a half-dozen requests for absentee ballots.
Sue Cote, who has been the Sanford city clerk for five years, says this is the first time during her tenure that she hasn't received ballots on time. The ballots finally arrived at her office on Tuesday afternoon, so she'll be able to get absentee ballots out to the dozen voters who had requested them, she said.
McLaughlin, the Old Orchard Beach clerk, said she's heard from other clerks that they received their ballots Monday and are in the process of mailing them out.
"I know they're coming," she said. "People have been very understanding." Gillian Graham can be contacted at 791-6315 or at: ggraham@pressherald.com Twitter: grahamgillian

Texto completo:   Joe Appel on importing wine.
World wine consumers are enjoying a Golden Age, with easier access to a broader spectrum of better made and more interesting wines than at any other time in history. But unlike other recent revolutionary advances in access - in information, music, literature, visual art, taxicab service - the world of wine isn't quite flat. It still deals with a physical product whose costs of production vary wildly. It still needs to be moved around, and because it's alcohol, there are all sorts of legal restrictions to navigate.
The Golden Age is not the same everywhere. Maine, with a small, scattered population mostly rural and suburban, suffering under jurisdictional procedures still tainted by Puritanism, is definitely not a modern-day Athens. Maine oenophiles who seek new and unfamiliar wines and full immersion in what this endlessly diverse product can express, sometimes feel walled in.
But less and less. A wave of new wines, some brought to the United States by established importers newly distributing in Maine and others from recently launched importers, has arrived here. And a few Maine distributors are working harder than ever to bring in wines from the West Coast that have evolved past the caricaturishly blowsy, bombastic profile of Big America.
A reminder: No wine from another country can be sold in the United States without routing through a three-tier system, which includes the producer who makes the wine, the wholesale "distributor" who arranges with the winery to ship wine here and the "retailer" who sells the wine to the customer. To get you all good and confused, note that these terms are slippery. Some states, including Maine, add an additional tier: the state distributor, who provides logistics and sales support to retailers and restaurants. In such states, the original three-tier "distributor" gets called an "importer."
I'm not alone in arguing that one of the better ways to discover new wines is to follow importers. When you encounter a wine you enjoy, note the importer (usually listed on the bottle's back label) and seek out more of her wines. Any retailer can help you with this. Importers are people, with particular prejudices and tastes. If you enjoy that importer's Cotes du Rhone, you've got a better than average chance of liking his Rioja.
The exciting news about so many of the extraordinary wines now available in Maine is that while the importers operate on a very small scale (1 to 3 employees), the state distributors operate on a relatively large one. That's right, it's the big guys who are pushing the envelope hardest right now.
As recently as five years ago, a compelling (if controversially incomplete and one-sided) Maine Magazine article claimed that our state's smaller, more nimble distributors (Crush, Easterly, SoPo, Devenish, Mariner) were a priori more trustworthy for good wine, since their founders were wine lovers, while the larger distributors (Nappi, National, Pine State, Central) were run by corporate bean-counters. The little guys were finding boutiquey, idiosyncratic, passionate importers to work with. According to the story, the biggies were using their market power (fueled by beer sales) to push mediocre, generic wines that satisfied distant multinationals.
This was never an accurate picture, but telling consumers to look for a small Maine distributor's name on the 15-cent deposit sticker provided a useful framework for steering them toward good, small-production wines.
Now, though, the name of the distributor is far less meaningful, because capitalism worked: The little guys changed the rules, and now the big guys are playing the game. The game favors curiosity, openness to new flavors, commitment to cultural diversity, and a fierce defense of balance and grace in wine, over power and sheen. If we, as wine drinkers, play this game well, we will be partly responsible for improving not only the character of wine culture in Maine, but also the future of responsible winemaking worldwide.
For the vast majority of these importers have distinct points of view, which emerge from an engagement with the most pressing issues in agriculture and economics today. Their emphasis is on organic farming or at least drastic reduction in pesticide use, and wines made with minimal technological and chemical intervention.
The wines themselves are supple and lithe, with balanced alcohol levels. They are often (though not always) from less well-known regions, since the Big Bs - Bordeaux, Burgundy, Barolo, Barbaresco, Brunello - have been largely priced out of relevance by international richies who boost overall prices as they amass trophy cellars.
Pricing on the small-importer wines generally is based on unconventionally tight margins, transparently represented, with limited supplies meant to sell quickly in a few markets. Translation: The wines are here, but not for long.
Schatzi Wines is a two-year-old import company begun by Kevin Pike, a longtime driving force behind Terry Theise's exceptional portfolio of German, Austrian and Champagne wines. Pike formed the company with the Rheingau's esteemed Johannes Leitz, and now imports a small selection of wines from France, Austria and Germany. Seek out the spicy, toned Altenburger blaufrankisch; savory pinot noir from Heger; and benchmark rieslings from Spindler and Leitz.
Langdon Shiverick is a larger, longer-standing importer, some of whose portfolio is just now available in Maine. I've been delighted by so many of these wines. Try the full-bodied, fleshy Samuel Billaud Chablis; a waxy, floral white Cotes du Rhone from Domaine de la Solitude; the charred, licorice-tinged, negrette-based wines of Fronton's Domaine le Roc; an earthy, pure, biodynamically farmed Chinon from Beatrice and Pascal Lambert that comes in a 3-liter box; and a gorgeously spicy but surprisingly delicate Vacqueyras from Domaine du Terme.
Jenny and Francois is a well-respected importer of expressly "natural" wines: no chemical herbicides, only indigenous yeasts, handpicking, little or no filtration or sulfites, etc. I am not a natural-wine Kool-Aid drinker, but the Jenny and Francois wines I love have this enthralling softness, transparency and depth. The Clos Siguier Cahors is surprisingly light, fresh and silky for the appellation. The Gaspard pinot noir is from the Loire Valley's Saint Pourcain, vinified semi-carbonically, vibrant and ripe. The Domaine Binner riesling from an esteemed biodynamic producer in Alsace stands on its own, one of the two or three most exciting new wines I've tasted all year: creamy, calm and plungingly deep, fully dry, intense, respirating, confident.
Serge Dore has been importing for 20 years. I've only recently become acquainted with his portfolio, and have fallen quite hard for several Bordeaux. The Chateau de Francs Cotes de Francs is dominated by cabernet franc, structured but with a creamy, milk chocolate lusciousness. And two white Bordeaux, at opposite ends of the spectrum: the Chateau la Grande Metairie Entre-Deux-Mers Blanc is an unbeatable, mouthwatering weeknight wine, playing sauvignon gris and muscadelle off the sauvignon blanc with style. The white Chateau de Portets Blanc from Graves is at another level entirely, a wine of majority semillon with some sauvignon blanc that ages in oak after six months of batonnage (lees stirring). It drips with fig, peach and honey, sensually overpacked, yet acidity is strong, the wine is dry and the finish is clean; simply incredible.
Don't get caught up in the tasting notes. The memorable aspect here is that many Maine people are working harder than ever to create a vital, progressive culture for wine love in our state. You and I ought to work just as hard to explore the abounding options. Joe Appel is the wine buyer at Rosemont Market. He can be reached at: soulofwine.appel@gmail.com

Texto completo:   The MEREDA Index, a semi-annual measure of the strength of Maine's commercial real estate market, is down compared with the fall and spring of 2015. The index for those two prior periods was boosted by huge commercial real estate deals.
The Maine Real Estate & Development Association's MEREDA Index, a semiannual measure of the strength of Maine's commercial real estate market, is down compared with the fall and spring of 2015.
The MEREDA Index for spring 2016 is 91, compared with 100 in fall 2015 and 110 in spring 2015, the association said Tuesday. Prior to that, the index, which was first published in spring 2013, had not topped 80, MEREDA said.
An index score of 100 would be roughly equal to the market's 2006 peak in terms of construction employment and the total value and square footage of properties sold.
MEREDA said in a news release that the index was unusually high during the two prior periods because of two huge commercial real estate deals in downtown Portland: the $35 million sale of 100 Middle St. in March 2015 and the $66 million sale of One and Two Portland Square in April 2015.
"The actual dip in commercial (real estate) exclusive of these very large sales was small," said MEREDA President Michael O'Reilly, a senior vice president at Bangor Savings, in the release. "The residential component was a primary positive driver; sales of existing homes and new mortgage originations both saw strong increasing trends."
The lack of available homes for sale is driving demand for new residential construction in both the single-family and condominium market, O'Reilly said.
While the construction industry continues to deal with a workforce shortage, the construction component of the index is exhibiting a gradual rise, he said.
"In fact, (the) construction component of the MEREDA Index is now at its highest since 2008," O'Reilly said. J. Craig Anderson can be contacted at 791-6390 or at: canderson@pressherald.com Twitter: jcraiganderson

Texto completo:   With gas prices low, people are planning to hit the road in record numbers, which bodes well for upcoming Maine tourist season. Gas Buddy infographic is available.
With gasoline prices down over last summer, Americans are planning to hit the road this summer, which is good news for the Maine tourism industry.
In a survey of more than 65,000 of its members, GasBuddy, a website and smartphone app that helps consumers find cheap gas, found that more than 75 percent were planning to travel this summer, up 2.2 percent from last year. Not surprisingly, 79 percent of respondents planned to travel by car, according to the company's annual summer travel study.
The local chapter of the American Automobile Association, AAA Northern New England, will issue its travel forecast Thursday, but spokesman Patrick Moody agreed that gas prices that are lower than last summer will likely spur an increase in people driving to Maine for day trips and overnight vacations.
Maine's current price is $2.30 per gallon, according to AAA - close to the 2016 high, but 35 cents lower than the $2.65 per gallon of a year ago. Portland prices are about a penny more.
"Low gas prices are good news for Maine tourism," said Jennifer Geiger of the state Office of Tourism. "We are a drive-to destination, with 75 percent of our visitors arriving by car. Our research shows that scenic touring is one of the top-rated activities for Maine, so low gas prices could certainly mean a boost."
Geiger didn't have any hard data on Memorial Day weekend or early season reservations, but she said hoteliers are telling the office unofficially that bookings are strong.
"Motorists will be filling up their tanks with the cheapest summer gasoline since 2005 and we are finding that more people than ever will be taking advantage by hitting the road," said Patrick DeHaan, GasBuddy petroleum analyst. "Nationally, we'll be saving $2.6 billion over the long weekend versus the highest-priced Memorial Day weekend in 2011."
The GasBuddy survey found that more people are traveling for leisure than obligation, with 53 percent traveling to relax and take in local culture compared to 51 percent last year. The survey also found 56 percent of travelers who participated in the national survey plan to drive at least 400 miles round trip, 36 percent are planning at least two summer road trips in 2016 and day trips are up 4 percent.
State officials hope to build on last year's strong season. Maine enjoyed a 4 percent increase in overnight stays and 4.6 percent increase in day visits in 2015 over the previous year, Geiger said. While the summer remained the height of the season, drawing 24.3 million of the state's 33.9 million annual visitors, Maine saw a big increase in fall visits, with 12.8 percent more travelers in September, October and November than in 2014.
A strong summer season would be good news for the state's 1,000 gas stations, but not necessarily for the reason you would think. The owners of gas stations make their money off of the food, drinks and alcohol they sell in their convenience stores, not from the small percentage of what they earn off gas sales at the pump, said Jamie Py, head of Maine Energy Marketers Association, a gas station trade group that represents about 120 state petroleum retailers.
Vacationing drivers are more likely to step inside the store and buy products with a good profit margin for the Shell or Mobil franchisee than someone fueling up on a daily commute to work, Py said. Maine franchisees really need that boost this summer because they are coming off a bad winter season, when warm weather hurt their traditionally strong sales to snowmobilers, Py said.
It's still too early to tell where gas prices may head over the summer, Moody said. Gas prices can fluctuate due to unpredictable factors, like hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and foreign unrest. But demand for gas leading into the summer driving season often pushes prices up - crude oil prices are nearing $50 a barrel this week - and it's likely that prices are heading for a new 2016 high in the coming days.
For consumers in Maine and across most of the country, however, prices are still lower now than they were a year ago, Moody noted. The average price per gallon, nationally, is $2.22, a bump of 11 cents month over month but still 48 cents less per gallon now than one year ago, according to a national AAA report issued Monday.

Texto completo:   Rail advocates try to rally support in Augusta
AUGUSTA -- From the outset of Tuesday's Maine passenger rail meeting, Richard Rudolph of the Maine Rail Group was clear about what he wanted - support to form a stakeholders group charged with doing whatever it can to return passenger rail service to central Maine, particularly by identifying the potential economic benefits.
At the close of the three-hour summit - which drew business and economic development officials from across central Maine and beyond - he said he felt certain he had gotten the support he was looking for.
But that might be the easiest accomplishment on what promises to be a complicated journey.
For as clearly as Rudolph and Jack Sutton, also of the Maine Rail Group, can see the economic development promise of passenger rail service, others can see hurdles, and chief among them is the difficulty in securing funds for transportation infrastructure that's costly to build and maintain.
Passenger rail service, in the form of the Amtrak Downeaster, connects coastal Maine cities and towns from Brunswick south to Boston with daily round-trip service. State lawmakers have approved $400,000 in funding, matched by $50,000 each from Lewiston and Auburn, to examine the economic effects of a passenger line that links those communities to Portland.
While officials in Augusta and Waterville have voted to show their support to consider the return of rail service to those cities, that's only a very early step.
"The people in Lewiston and Auburn already have money to look at this," Rudolph said. "We're better off having a more focused group look at train service to Augusta and beyond, maybe to Bangor, and to Rockland, too, if they want."
He said he's not interested in pitting communities interested in rail against one another.
"I want to see all boats rise together," he said.
Patricia Quinn, executive director of the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority, which operates the Downeaster, gave a brief update.
"Last year was the first year that ridership was down," Quinn said, attributing the decline to bad weather and construction that caused 550 trains to be canceled. Also contributing to lower ridership numbers was the historic drop in the price of gasoline, she said. When gas prices go down, ridership softens.
"But now," she said, "ridership is increasing, on-time performance is increasing and ridership satisfaction is up."
In an interview, Quinn said more delays are expected later this year as a construction project to replace ties is anticipated to interrupt service for about six weeks from mid-October to Thanksgiving. But when it's complete, the Downeaster will be able to add a sixth round trip between Maine and Boston.
To the group assembled at the summit, she said she also was serving as its reality check.
"It takes a lot of time, effort and money and people to ride trains," she said.
For the first time since the Downeaster started operating in 2001, she said, the Downeaster and the rail authority are facing organized opposition.
"It's important not to put what we have done in jeopardy," she said.
The authority, which was created by the Legislature in 1995, has drawn criticism from residents in Brunswick, where an Amtrak layover facility was proposed where trains could be parked overnight. Residents unsuccessfully challenged the plan on grounds that it would be noisy and disruptive to the residential neighborhood the facility would border.
A little over a year ago, a legislative committee voted unanimously to seek an audit of the rail authority by the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, in response to concerns raised by critics of the agency's transparency. The quasi-governmental organization receives $10 million annually, of which $2 million comes from the state of Maine.
Quinn said she's spent a lot of time in a lot of meetings held by groups interested in expanding rail service.
"You have to bring something to the table other than random thoughts," she said. "It's not an inexpensive business. You have to have a goal. You have to know who is going to ride the train. Where will they go? When will they go? It's a volume business, and you have to have critical mass."
Leaders at chambers of commerce and economic development organizations identified a wide range of possible economic opportunities to bringing rail service to central Maine, including additional shopping and tourism opportunities, transportation to health care facilities, transportation to colleges and universities, and visits to friends and family. They also see potential in the twin demographic trends affecting Maine - older residents wishing to give up their cars and younger residents, in the millennial generation, not wishing to own or drive cars.
Patrick Wright, economic development coordinator for Gardiner, injected this note of caution: "In my experience in community and economic development, I don't see train service as the big fix. It doesn't create economic development; it reflects it. So other strategies you have will work hand in glove with rail service."
"It doesn't matter which route is chosen," Sutton said. "The important thing is to get a system up and running as fast as possible."
Decisions such as those involved in running a line and managing passengers can't be made individually or in a vacuum, he said. If Lewiston and Auburn are successful in securing rail service, he said, it will bring along the other projects.

Texto completo:   Two new cookbooks on New England Lobster Shacks and seafood markets, with recipes.
A new cookbook and an updated guide lead readers through New England's seafood shacks and markets.
Just in time for summer, two seafood-centric books are out to help guide you through the crowded landscape of lobster shacks and seafood markets in New England.
Both are by Mike Urban, a food and travel writer based in Old Saybrook, Connecticut.
Mainers may think they know the lobster shacks that dot the Maine coast, but the revised and updated version of "Lobster Shacks: A Road-Trip Guide to New England's Best Lobster Joints" - previously published in 2012 - will open your eyes to many you may never have stumbled across.
Half of the book is dedicated to Maine lobster shacks from Kittery all the way up to Eastport, where relative newcomer Quoddy Bay Lobster (founded in 2007) makes its own smoked lobster pate.
It's interesting to read about the history of some of the shacks, and while this isn't a cookbook, recipes are sprinkled throughout. In the back, an index sorts the shacks into types - most romantic shacks, shacks with dock or deck dining, shacks with great architectural design, and so on.
Urban's newest project is "The New England Seafood Markets Cookbook: Recipes from the Best Lobster Pounds, Clam Shacks, and Fishmongers." The book includes about a dozen Maine seafood markets, including the best-known markets in Portland. The markets and their recipes are not sorted by state, so it takes a little hunting to find those from Maine, but that's OK.
With this book, availability of ingredients is more important than location. Who really cares if that luscious-looking lobster Benedict recipe originates in Rhode Island, as long as Maine lobster can be used in the dish?
The book is divided into many sections that go beyond Soups and Chowders, Lobster, and Cod and Haddock. Some of the more interesting recipes can be found under Seafood Cakes, Grilled Fish, Flounder and Sole, and something called New England Exotica. That last category includes recipes for Easy Baked Maple-Glazed Arctic Char from City Fish Market in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and Corned Hake and Potatoes from Fisherman's Catch in Damariscotta.
You'll want to keep both of these books handy this summer - one in your car for when you hit the road looking for a lobster dinner, and one in your kitchen.
BACON-BOURBON SCALLOPS
From "Lobster Shacks: A Road-Trip Guide to New England's Best Lobster Joints" by Mike Urban
Portland Lobster Company regularly rolls out this tasty dish as a special.
Serves 2-3
1 pound fresh jumbo scallops
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
6 ounces thick-cut bacon (preferably apple wood-smoked or similar), chopped
2 cloves garlic
1/4 cup chopped shallots
3 ounces bourbon
11/2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/3 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
Lightly sprinkle the scallops with salt and pepper. Heat the butter and olive oil in a pan on high heat until almost smoking. Add the scallops and bacon to pan and sear scallops quickly, about 30 seconds on each side. Do not lift or move scallops while searing. Remove scallops and set aside.
Add garlic and shallots to the now-empty pan, and saute until they soften. Add bourbon, and carefully ignite to burn off alcohol. Once the flame subsides, add the brown sugar, heavy cream and 11/2 teaspoons of the fresh parsley. Reduce the sauce until the desired consistency is reached. Pour the sauce over the jumbo scallops and garnish with 1/2 teaspoon remaining parsley.
Clam Shack Seafood Market in Kennebunk keeps presidential swordfish stocked and ready for whenever President George H.W. Bush calls. The market has a decades-long relationship with the Bush family and their Walker's Point staff, who are loyal customers. This recipe was handed down by longtime Bush family chef Ariel Guzman, who adapted it from a family friend's recipe. Clam Shack Seafood has adapted it slightly.
PRESIDENTIAL SWORDFISH
From "The New England Seafood Markets Cookbook: Recipes from the best lobster pounds, clam shacks, and fishmongers" by Mike Urban
Serves 4
4 swordfish steaks, 6-8 ounces each
MARINADE
1 teaspoon coarse salt
1 teaspoon coarse ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried onion
1/2 teaspoon dried garlic
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon dried coriander
2 cups mayonnaise
1/3 cup lemon juice
In a small bowl, whisk together the spices and herbs. In a larger bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and lemon juice. Add the herbs and spices to the mayonnaise mixture, and stir until smooth.
Place the swordfish steaks in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour in the marinade, and move around the contents of the bag to make sure the steaks are covered and coated thoroughly. Refrigerate in the bag on a plate for at least 3 hours.
Preheat the outdoor grill. Grill the swordfish steaks over high heat for about 2 minutes per side, anticipating flare-ups from the marinade. The steaks will be ivory colored and golden brown around the edges when done. Meredith Goad can be contacted at 791-6332 or at: mgoad@pressherald.com Twitter: MeredithGoad

Texto completo:   CARIBOU, Maine -- There's something new brewing in Aroostook County. The opening of the first craft brewery in Caribou is on tap, and the beer is scheduled to pour in mid-June.
Northern Maine Brewing Co. will be the only craft brewery north of Orono, and with planned beers including the stout "Skidder Grease" and the lighter IPA "Northern Maine Light," those behind the venture say the goal is to keep the flavors, ambiance and ingredients as local as possible.
"Is Aroostook County ready for a craft beer pub?" brewery co-investor and spokesman Joe Sleeper said. "Absolutely."
Carpenters, painters, plumbers and electricians were hard at work on the building located across from the Caribou Inn and Convention Center earlier this month, putting the finishing touches on the bar and restaurant areas.
In the kitchen, newly hired executive chef Joseph Gervais was tiling and grouting the floor.
Gervais and Sleeper are looking forward to introducing area residents to small-batch beers.
"People's take on craft beer is that they are really strong and dark or really 'hoppy' tasting," Gervais said. "But really, what we are doing is brewing small batches using local ingredients to make a great tasting beer."
Sleeper said using those local ingredients will create a uniquely northern Maine brew selection.
"Most of the components for the beer we will brew here are grown within one hour of Northern Maine Brewing Co.," he said. "We are truly committed to the local portion of this project."
In addition, all of the table tops, the bar top and doors were crafted by members of the Amish community in Easton, Sleeper said.
What is not local is the high-tech brewery equipment itself -- a first of its kind in this country designed and made by Fleck's Brauhaus Technik of Austria.
"It's a very compact brewhouse," according to Vincent Fleck, founder and director of the company.
The brewery can make two 3.5 barrel batches of beer per day, Fleck said. Several of the first trial batches at Northern Maine Brewing Co. included a red ale and a light lager.
Fleck was in Caribou in March to direct the installation of the brewery and was back in early May to assist in fine tuning the fermentation and brew tanks. Thanks to the Internet, Fleck will remain connected to Northern Maine Brewing Co. to help troubleshoot any issues. The system is completely automated, Fleck said, which frees the brewers up to research and develop new beers.
According to market sales, northern Mainers are thirsty for new beers.
"People in The County drink a lot of beer," Dick Cyr of Maine Distributors said. "There are 69,000 people living in Aroostook, and last year I [distributed] 700,000 cases of beer here."
Maine Distributer gets craft beers from around the state into the retail market, and according to Cyr there are more than 70 different craft breweries in the state.
"There are none north of Orono," he said. "The time is right for this one."
Gervais said his restaurant will seat 85, and he has begun the hiring process for the 15 to 20 employees he will need to staff it and the bar.
"The biggest thing people are going to notice about a craft beer bar is that they will be getting a very drinkable beer that they can savor and pair with their food," Gervais said. "It is a different dining and drinking experience."
Fleck said Aroostook County has everything it needs to produce a high-quality beer.
"You must have good malts, good hops, good water and good, clean equipment," he said. "You have all those things here."
The best brewers, he said, learn by doing with trial and error. He said Sleeper, Gervais and their crew are well on their way to a quality beer.
"They started in March and now we are seeing some of the results," Fleck said. "They are fine tuning, but it looks very good."
His company has built breweries in 35 countries, and the one starting up at Northern Maine Brewing Co. is his 155th and first in the U.S. On the restaurant side of things, Gervais promises a menu as unique and as locally sourced as the beers.
"We are going to buy as much as we can from local vendors to offer a mixture of pub food and entrees inspired by locally grown and produced ingredients," he said. "We really want that local feel to carry through."

Texto completo:   HAMPDEN, Maine -- As thick flames quickly consumed Jean Dill's residence Monday night, neighbors at Hampden Trailer Park on Main Road North ran to her aid.
"I was standing outside having a cigarette and saw the smoke. I yelled, 'There is a fire,' and we took off running," neighbor Jen Lanphear said Tuesday morning of the fire that was reported around 7:30 p.m. the night before.
Nancy McFadden, who is related to Dill by marriage, said her neighbor, a man named Marcus, was the first to arrive.
"He ran down there. She was inside," McFadden said. "There were flames everywhere."
The man said Wednesday that Dill had escaped the building when he got there.
Dill, 52, suffered serious burns and was taken by LifeFlight to Maine Medical Center in Portland on Monday night, McFadden said. She was listed in satisfactory condition Tuesday, a hospital spokesman said.
Dill's kitten died in the fire, which completely destroyed the residence, leaving only the mobile home's small blackened stove standing. The burned walls of her home Tuesday were in a pile by the road.
"She was cooking something on the stove and decided to go lay down," Joe Rogers, Hampden Public Safety Director, said Tuesday. "Her smoke detector actually woke her up. Because of that, she made it out."
The smoke was so thick that Dill could not see but was able to make her way toward her front door, Rogers said.
"She burned her hands when she went to open the door," he said. "She received burns to her face and hands."
Unattended cooking on the stove in the kitchen is the official cause of the fire, Sgt. Ken Grimes of the Maine fire marshal's office said Tuesday.
"I'm just really concerned about Jeannie," said Bill Cotter, who lives in the mobile home directly behind Dill's, which Tuesday had burned and melted siding.
He said he saw the flames as he was leaving his house, heading to the store.
"I opened my door and said, 'Oh my friggin' Lord.' The flames were right there," he said standing at his door, pointing to where Dill's residence once stood about 10 feet away.
After Dill got out of the burning structure, "her hair was still smoldering," Lanphear said Tuesday standing in the street near her home. "She was walking toward that puddle. She wanted to put her hair out."
The neighbors helped Dill to a nearby chair outside and waited for an ambulance to arrive.
U.S. Route 1A was temporarily closed during the fire because the hydrant was located across the road. Firefighters from Bangor, Hermon, Holden, Newburgh and Winterport assisted local crews, Rogers said. The final fire truck returned to its station around 11 p.m., he said.
"She lost everything," McFadden said, sitting in her car parked near Dill's flattened and charred trailer. "It's a miracle that she even got out. I've never seen anything go up so fast."

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Real estate activity in Maine continues to inch toward levels last seen before the housing market collapsed and took the rest of the economy with it.
The Maine Real Estate and Development Association revealed during its spring conference Tuesday that its quarterly index hit a level on par with the fall of 2006.
The index uses the start of 2006 as a benchmark for levels of commercial, residential and construction activity, set at 100. The index rose above 90 in the first three months of 2016, with the commercial real estate sector remaining the closest to a full recovery.
Mike O'Reilly, senior vice president and Bangor Savings and MEREDA's president, said in a news release that the sharp rise in commercial activity was partly due to the two major sales of One and Two Portland Square and 100 Middle St. in Portland, which boosted the square footage sold in early 2015.
"The actual dip in commercial exclusive of these very large sales was small," O'Reilly said.
"The residential component was a primary positive driver; sales of existing homes and new mortgage originations both saw strong increasing trends."
O'Reilly said pressure on the market for existing houses, where sales volume and prices have stabilized, has prompted new construction, despite that industry's workforce shortage.
Gradually rising construction employment, mortgage originations and housing permits have driven up the construction portion of the group's index in recent quarters, according to data compiled by MEREDA.
O'Reilly said construction in hospitality, senior housing and condominium markets contributed to past increases in construction activity, with the latest spike coming from residential building construction.
Harper Lee Collins, a broker with Re/Max Heritage in Yarmouth, wrote in this year's MEREDA report that residential real estate in the booming Greater Portland market has started to approach more typical levels, measured by the rate at which new properties are scooped up.
Census data for 2015 showed building permits, by units added, were up by 14 percent last year, with the fastest growth in buildings of five or more units.
At the current rate of purchasing, it would take about three months to sell all of the single-family homes on the market in the Greater Portland area and about 4.5 months to sell all of the condos on the market.

Texto completo:   HOULTON, Maine -- Houlton police Chief Joe McKenna was midway through his presentation to honor fallen law enforcement officers as part of National Police Week when one of his officers had to leave the ceremony to answer a call.
It was another sign that police work never stops, even to honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.
McKenna organized the 15-minute ceremony at the Houlton Police Department on Tuesday, which included an invocation and wreath laying. It attracted members of the Maine Warden Service, the Aroostook County Sheriff's Office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Maine Forest Service, Maine State Police and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as well as a number of military veterans.
In 1962, President John F. Kennedy proclaimed May 15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day and the calendar week in which May 15 falls as National Police Week.
McKenna noted that traffic stops and ambushes were the leading cause of death for police officers in the line of duty.
Eighty-three names are engraved on the Maine Law Enforcement Officers Memorial located on State Street next to the State House in Augusta. Ten of those officers who died in the line of duty are from Aroostook County, McKenna said Tuesday.
The police chief asked those in the crowd to remember all law enforcement officers as they perform their duties to protect people and communities.
Aroostook County Sheriff Darrell Crandall read off the names of the five deputy sheriffs who died in the line of duty. They included Norman Dube, who suffered a massive heart attack in November 1997 in Ashland while attempting to interrogate a suspected drunken driver.
State police Lt. Brian Harris also honored Detective Glenn Strange, who suffered a fatal heart attack Oct. 17, 1997, several days after being punched in the chest by a suspect who assaulted him. After Strange complained of chest pains and it was determined he suffered an injury to his heart, he was fitted with a pacemaker. While he and his wife were driving home from the hospital three days later, he suffered a fatal heart attack.
The Maine Warden Service also honored Daryl Gordon, who died when his plane crashed on Clear Lake in a remote section of Piscataquis County in March 2011.
No new names are being added this year to the Maine Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Augusta. An annual observance also will take place at the memorial beginning at 11 a.m. Thursday. The guest speaker will be Maine Attorney General Janet Mills.

Texto completo:   HARRINGTON - Jennie Effie (Strout) Ganiel, 73, died peacefully at home in Harrington, Maine on Friday, May 13, 2016. Jennie was born on February 10, 1943 to Gladys (Grant) and Winslow Strout in their home on Pirate's Corner in Harrington. She attended Harrington High School, where she played basketball in the days before women could cross the half-court line, and graduated in 1961.
As a young woman, she moved to New Jersey, where she worked at Wheaton Plastics and Lennox China. She married her husband, Carl, in Egg Harbor City, New Jersey on January 26, 1968. She returned to Maine in 1974 with Carl and daughter Rebecca. There she gave birth to two more daughters, Carla and Gladys, and raised her family in the house she had grown up in.
While her children were young, Jennie was a stay-at-home mother and caregiver to her own mother. Later, she worked for Worcester Wreath decorating Christmas wreaths and for Jasper Wyman and Sons, holding a variety of jobs in the blueberry factory including the pick-over room and the lab. She took pride in working hard and doing a good job, had fun joking with her co-workers, and was never afraid to stand up for the other women in the factory.
Jennie was an officer and active member of the Harrington High School Alumni Association for many years and looked forward to reconnecting with her classmates at the annual Alumni Banquet. She attended church when she was able and had a strong sense of faith. She loved the smell of lilacs and enjoyed growing flowers, including her prized Christmas cacti and African violets. She was a talented baker whose blueberry pies and buckles were exceptional. She was often the loudest voice in the stands at her children's sporting events, and on Saturday nights, she could often be found at a baked bean supper. She spent many pleasant hours drinking tea in the kitchen of her friend and neighbor, Edie Berry.
Jennie is survived by her husband of forty-eight years, Carl Ganiel; her daughters, Rebecca White and partner James Crowley of Addison, Carla Ganiel of Washington, DC and Gladys Ganiel O'Neill and husband Brian O'Neill of Belfast, Northern Ireland, two grandchildren, Chad Crowley and Ronan O'Neill; many family members and friends, including a special sister-in-law, Laura Strout, whose support in the last weeks of Jennie's life was very much appreciated. She was predeceased by her parents, Gladys and Winslow Strout; three brothers, Richard, Stanley and Irvin Strout; and one sister, Doris Gagne.
A memorial service will be arranged at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Maine Seacoast Mission, 127 West Street, Bar Harbor, ME 04609. A memorial website and guestbook is available at: http://memorialwebsites.legacy.com/jennie-ganiel/

Texto completo:   BUCKSPORT, Maine -- A Massachusetts man has been arrested after he allegedly demanded cash from a convenience store clerk Sunday night.
Adam Scott Kasevich Jr., 25, of Boston was arrested Monday afternoon on a Class B robbery charge, according to officials. A conviction for Class B crime in Maine carries a maximum possible sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $20,000.
According to Sgt. David Winchester of the Bucksport Police Department, the robbery occurred around 9:30 p.m. Sunday at the Circle K store on Main Street.
At the time, Bucksport police indicated on the department's Facebook page that a man dressed entirely in black entered the store and demanded cash from a clerk before fleeing with an undisclosed amount of money. The robber and a passenger in the vehicle he arrived in were last seen heading east on Route 1 in a reddish-colored four-door sedan, police said.
Winchester said Tuesday that social media played a significant role in identifying the vehicle and the alleged robber. After police received multiple leads, Kasevich was tracked down in the Belfast area, where, with the help of Waldo County Sheriff's Department and Belfast police, he was taken into custody and charged late Monday afternoon, Winchester said.
"We got a tremendous response on social media," Winchester said.
He added that police do not plan to file any charges against the man who was in the vehicle with Kasevich.
Winchester said that no weapon was displayed during the robbery. He declined to identify the amount of money that Kasevich is accused of taking from the store, but said "a portion" of it was recovered when Kasevich was arrested.
According to Winchester, members of the Hancock County Sheriff's Department and Maine State Police assisted in the response to the robbery scene Sunday evening.
He said Kasevich is due to appear in court on the robbery charge on June 21. In the meantime, Kasevich is expected to be held without bail at the Hancock County Jail in Ellsworth, he added.

Texto completo:   EASTPORT, Maine -- A Silicon Valley, California, resident is so in love with Eastport that she suggested a collaboration among educators on both coasts.
That collaboration led to Shead High School being named one of 348 semifinalists nationwide for a $10 million XQ Super School prize.
Caitlin Hoffman of California was in Eastport last summer when she saw an ad in the New York Times for the XQ Super School contest, which is funded by Lauren Powell Jobs, wife of the late Steve Jobs, who co-founded Apple Inc.
The contest seeks ideas for completely reinventing and transforming the model for public high schools, with the five best ideas submitted being awarded $10 million each to further pursue their plans.
"Education is so broken and this is such a great opportunity," Hoffman said, adding she had fallen in love with Eastport and its community during her visit.
She returned to Eastport in October to pitch the idea of a collaboration on the contest to the community, meeting with school officials and students in the process. She returned again in February to help them meet the initial Feb. 11 contest deadline.
"We had to move really fast," said Hoffman, adding she was unfortunately unable to come to Eastport to help with the current phase of planning.
"I don't know if we would have even heard about the contest [without Hoffman]," said Jon Calame, an Eastport School Committee member and parent who now serves as captain of the team entered in the competition.
"Not many of us were paying attention and none of us thought it would go anywhere," Calame said.
Contestants were asked to "rethink" the high school experience based on what Calame described as the "cynical but perhaps not faulty assumption that high school has got a lot of problems."
With Hoffman's help, Calame and a team of Eastport residents proposed the PACT, or the Pacific Atlantic Community Technology School. It would be a part of Shead High School, which currently has about 100 students.
Calame said students from both coasts would be able to spend time learning on the opposite coast by opting into the PACT school. They would then participate in "campaigns" asking them to solve a question or problem such as, "How can Maine fishermen avoid overfishing and harming the fisheries?"
Teams of five to 10 students and instructors would investigate the topic and then present their findings and receive critiques from other teams of students, he said.
"We're saying nobody knows the answers and we're all co-investigating," he said.
Hoffman is the owner of All Minds Matter, an education center that offers academic coaching for students that is integrated with schools and teachers. Because All Minds Matter is for profit, however, Shead can't partner directly with it. But, Shead may be able to partner with a nonprofit arm which could be formed as part of the company to provide the West Coast portion of the bicoastal school, Hoffman said.
That detail and many other specifics have yet to be worked out, though the team needs to have them in place by the next deadline in the contest, which is May 23, Calame said. The team also will need to provide the contest organizers with specifics on how the team would manage the endowment, the curriculum, any building projects, teacher recruitment, performance assessment, technology and governance.
"They're asking us to design an entire school. It's inventing it from the ground up," Calame said.
The group of 348 semifinalists will be culled to 50 finalists, to be announced July 30. PACT team members believe Shead is the only semifinalist from Maine, but XQ project organizers did not release a list and would not confirm it.
The five winners then will be announced Aug. 4, according to a news release issued by Coleman Brice, a parent and member of the PACT team.
Hoffman said she was not surprised the proposal was named a semifinalist.
"I think XQ saw that we put together something valid," she said.
Shead Principal Paul Theriault said the school was "energized by this incentive to think larger."
Looking ahead at this next round, he said, "We're not at all worried -- we have insights and resources within our learning community that many cities cannot dream of."
Regardless of how far they get in the competition, Theriault said this is a great experience.
"Whether or not we arrive at the winners' circle in August, Eastport schools will be strengthened by this kind of full-sprint, no-holds-barred exploration," he said.

Texto completo:   They saw it across New England -- night owls and light sleepers, long-haul truck drivers and twentysomethings wandering home from the bars, even a fisherman out at sea: A bright streak shooting across the sky for several seconds around 12:50 a.m. Tuesday, ending with a burst of color.
Though a few on Twitter wondered if it might be a UFO or a North Korean rocket, most soon realized it was a meteor -- the unusually bright kind known as a fireball. By Tuesday afternoon, 450 people across the region had filed detail reports with the American Meteor Society.
Coupled with a boom heard in some places, it was an audiovisual phenomenon that night-sky observers say happens only a handful of times a year -- but not always over a region populated with potential observers. People as far off as New Jersey and Ontario could see it streaking above New England before the ball estimated at five feet in diameter and shrinking broke apart miles above western Maine -- though a trick of perspective made it appear exhilaratingly close to those who saw it.
Jaquelyn Fabian, an actress driving home from a late shoot on an indie horror flick, feared it had crashed into a dense neighborhood in Lowell. Workers on a supermarket roof in Rochester, N.H., watched it vanish at the nearby tree line. And Kathryn Riley, a Boston College senior, looked up in Cleveland Circle and thought another soon-to-graduate student had shot off a firework.
"The trail of it was super yellow, and I think I saw purple," said Riley, who soonrealized she might have seen a fireball meteor after doing a Google image search while standing on Beacon Street. "And then when it hit, or wherever it went, there was a green flash."
As they left the watering hole Mary Ann's, only some of her friends had the good fortune to be looking up, too.
"They kept joking the rest of the night that we didn't actually see anything, that we just witnessed a weird Green Line mishap," Riley said. "We were pretty adamant."
Working the overnight in Maine, Portland Police Sergeant Tim Farris caught the fireball on his dashcam, tearing toward the horizon.
"I looked up and saw this giant fireball streaking across the sky, and it seemed to explode into a million pieces," said Farris, a 19-year veteran of the force, bracing himself for a boom. He radioed dispatch to prepare them for alarmed calls from neighbors.
Except the dispatcher only half believed him, which is why Farris hit a key to tag the footage captured by his rolling dashcam. At the station, other officers coming off shifts marveled at the footage. One of them -- Brent Abbott, who often posts lighthearted messages to the public on the department's Facebook page -- thought it was too good to keep private, recording a video of the video to upload.
"The meteor (or alien spaceship) was caught on camera at approximately 0050 hours," Abbott soon wrote, posting at 3 a.m. "Let's hope the visitors are friendly."
By the time Farris woke up Tuesday afternoon, a quarter-million people and counting had watched the video online.
Others captured footage with their own dashboard cameras or with always-on backyard or harbor web cams. "The videos are just fantastic," said Mike Hankey, operations manager for the American Meteor Society.
The nonprofit society began collecting amateur reports in 1911, by mail. Hankey six years ago designed an app and website to make it easier for spotters to file online.
"The biggest and brightest meteor I've ever seen," wrote Curtis B., of Montague, 90 miles west of Boston. In the other direction, out to sea about 200 nautical miles east of Boston, observer Knickle R. wrote that he was fishing when he saw a green, orange, and yellow burst over the ocean.
Hankey said there is a meteor bright enough to generate 100-plus reports once or twice a month, but a fireball like this that can also be heard is much rarer -- with the sound most likely a sonic boom from the meteor's speed, he said, though possibly also the noise of it bursting apart.
Unlike predictably visible comet-based meteors associated with meteor showers, solitary fireballs originate in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. If they happen to cross paths with the earth, our planet's atmosphere causes them to suddenly decelerate, "like shooting a bullet into a pool of water," Hankey said.
NASA's Near Earth Object Program has recorded 11 meteors of this magnitude since the start of the year, said Christine Pulliam, a spokeswoman for the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
Hankey, citing data from NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office and footage captured by Boston University and the University of Western Ontario, said this meteor was about five feet in diameter and weighed 13,000 pounds when it started breaking apart as it hit the earth's atmosphere. Scientists tracked it moving at 38,900 miles an hour while it streaked above New Hampshire's White Mountains at an altitude of 52 miles.
It was rapidly shrinking -- shedding pieces and giving off light and heat to atmospheric friction -- by the time it broke apart over Maine, 28 miles above Upper Richardson Lake.
That might make remnants difficult to find, but it didn't stop the Maine Mineral and Gem Museum from announcing a $20,000 reward for the first two-pound fragment.
The under-construction museum in Bethel, which has a preview gallery open in advance of a 2017 debut, will focus primarily on Maine's rich geological deposits -- featuring the terrestrial, director Barbra Barrett said, but with a "special exhibit for the extraterrestrial."

Texto completo:   A police officer on the search for speeding drivers captured an unexpected celestial event: a meteoric fireball streaking across the sky.
On Tuesday, police Sgt. Tim Farris was parked in front of Central Fire Station in Portland, Maine, when his dashboard camera captured a meteor entering the atmosphere in an explosion of light. The bright flare was complemented by Sergeant Farris's exclamatory "Oh, my God."
"You never know what you are going to see on duty," the Portland Maine Police Department said in a tongue-in-cheek Facebook post with the video of the meteor. "Sgt. Farris was looking for speeders while parked in front of the central fire station and was able to observe some visitors "from away"....far away. The meteor (or alien spaceship) was caught on camera at approximately 0050 hours."
While the meteor was a shocking site for Faris and the residents of New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and parts of Canada who happened to glance up at just the right time, meteors burning up as they enter the Earth's atmosphere aren't completely rare. A similar scene was captured in Thailand in September.
Fortunately, most meteors burn up before reaching the Earth, and the majority of those that do land in unpopulated areas.
However, a few isolated incidents in which people have been killed have raised questions, such as how dangerous are meteors striking Earth and how prepared are scientists to detect them.
"The probability of an asteroid striking the Earth and causing serious damage is very remote but the devastating consequences of such an impact suggests we should closely study different types of asteroids to understand their compositions, structures, sizes, and future trajectories," says NASA says on their website.
Stephen Nelson, an environmental sciences professor with Tulane University, calculates the odds of getting killed by a meteor at about one in 250,000, the Monitor reported in February. For perspective, the average person is four times more likely to die in a flood (one in 60,000) than be killed by a meteor, but still much more likely to be killed by a meteor than win the lottery (one in more than 195 million).
And NASA is working to make those odds even lower. The agency's Planetary Defense Coordination Office monitor space objects that could be damaging if they entered the Earth's atmosphere. NASA has already identified more than 13,500 asteroid or comets.
Likewise, the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office keeps track of "space trash" that humans have put into orbit around the Earth. Space debris has recently been a growing concern for the safety of astronauts and space missions, but not for people on Earth.
"Asteroid detection, tracking and defense of our planet is something that NASA, its interagency partners, and the global community take very seriously," said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in the agency's news release in January.

Texto completo:   No horse slaughter
Few things are as hotly debated right now as American debt and congressional partisanship. Next Thursday, the Senate will vote on the crucial Udall-Kirk amendment to block tax dollars from going to horse slaughter plants. It's an opportunity to promote industry and humane treatment for horses while avoiding long-term negative impacts.
Taking funding from agricultural industries that feed and employ Americans to reopen inherently cruel, foreign-demand-driven horse slaughter plants puts American agricultural industries at risk and long-term food safety, environment and community health in peril.
The Udall-Kirk amendment, which has bipartisan support, would prohibit this, keeping tax dollars working for us. Sen. Susan Collins should support both our current industry and our long-term well-being by voting yes on this amendment next week.

Connection for cancer survivors
On May 11, I attended my first High Tea for the Caring Connections celebration in Bangor. It was a meaningful experience to sit among other breast cancer patients with whom I attend therapeutic meetings at the YMCA every week. Our facilitators, along with many of the doctors, nurses and technicians who have cared for many of us, also sat among us. We watched a video of interviews, recently filmed, with several of our members' contributions. I don't believe there was an unsmiling face in the crowd, nor a dry eye. Everyone in the room had a real understanding of the pain and loss endured, the fear and faith experienced. We honored givers and survivors and remembered those fallen along the way.
Anyone who is going through breast cancer or has in the past should join Caring Connections at the YMCA. It's free. I attend the weekly meeting and join in the swimming exercise after each meeting. No matter how differently we each dress, talk, worship, eat or seek treatment for cancer, we all have a deep connection: We are survivors. And this bond helps us all hold on and recover from the disease and from the trauma. This caring connection helps us realize we are survivors and reconnect with life.
Sue Thibodeau Baumgardner
Prospect
Russell for state Senate
I remember when Rep. Diane Russell told me that she was going to introduce an amendment at Maine's Democratic Convention to require superdelegates to follow the will of the voters, I thought that a nice idea, but it's never going to happen.
But, much to my surprise, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton supporters voted overwhelmingly to require superdelegates beginning in 2020 to follow the will of the voters, something that will strengthen our democratic process, thanks in large part to Russell's bold leadership.
Russell has a history of defying convention to stand up and win strong democratic reforms that improve our system and our way of life here in Maine, which is why this June 14 we need to vote for her to keep representing Portland in the state Senate.
Russell knows how to get things done for Maine. She is a strong, principled progressive, who first and foremost is fighting to create economic opportunity for working families in Maine.
It's Russell's fierce determination to do what's right, no matter what the political obstacle. That makes her the right person to represent Portland in the state Senate. Russell will stand up to Gov. Paul LePage's reckless policies, take issues to the voters when she needs to and will dare us to dream and fight for the type of reforms that we know are necessary.
Reducing the clout of superdelegates is just the beginning of Russell's fight, and I can't wait to see what's next when we elect her to represent Portland in the Maine Senate.

No gun problem here
It figures that retired police Chief Robert Schwartz would buy into the Bloomberg attempt to create more hassles for Maine gun owners. If it were such a great idea, why is so much money to support it coming from out of state? If it was so worthy, why couldn't just Maine anti-gun folks donate the money needed?
By far the largest supporter is Bloomberg's Everytown for Gun Safety and I resent that New York money trying to make Maine like that place. Maine doesn't have a gun problem.
Maine people are better than those flatlanders who even want to limit soft drinks. This is just New York foolishness and Maine people want no part of it.
When Everytown for Gun Safety shows me how many people out of the state have been prosecuted for illegally selling handguns purchased, then perhaps I might listen. Until then, why add more laws to be ignored by the criminals?

Make a national monument
In 1975, my husband and I started to come to Maine from the Washington, D.C., area. We camped on Mount Desert Island and fell in love with Acadia National Park. We often returned to be near the spectacular beauty of the park and absorb the power and serenity before returning to the urban area and our busy lives.
In September 1989, we moved full time to Hancock County to be near Acadia. We continue to visit Acadia many times a year. We are local and state taxpayers, buy services and goods from local vendors and volunteer for many local organizations. We are grateful for the marvelous gifts from the land owners who donated to form Acadia.
Having a national monument in northern Maine would help bring economic development to the depressed Katahdin region. Visitors to Acadia National Park spend millions of dollars every year at surrounding stores, restaurants, hotels and other places in Hancock County and Maine. Having a North Woods national monument also would give generations of young and old people from near and far a quiet, powerful, beautiful place to go to in order to restore their ability to function in this busy world. Some might even decide to move to Maine and become contributing taxpayers of this marvelous state. Please encourage President Barack Obama to designate the North Woods as a national monument.

Texto completo:   JOHNSON MOUNTAIN TOWNSHIP, Maine -- A truck carrying a windmill base from the Quebec border to Bingham crashed Monday after losing control on Route 201, according to Maine State Police.
The driver, Frederic Mercier, 30, of Quebec, had lost control on a corner, causing the truck, trailer and load to slide off the road, according to a statement from state police.
The truck knocked down a Central Maine Power pole before coming to a rest blocking the northbound lane.
Mercier, who was driving for Transport Tricam of Quebec, was not injured.
Central Maine Power and Fairpoint were called in to restore phone service and electricity to those in the area, while West Forks firefighters, the Maine Department of Transportation and the Department of Environmental Protection assisted at the scene.
The crash remains under investigation.

Texto completo:   BREWER - Adele passed away peacefully on May 2, 2016, in Brewer, Maine, surrounded by her beloved family and friends. She left her loved ones with a legacy of generosity, compassion, and humility.
Adele was born in Portola Valley, California on August 24, 1954, to Roger and Virginia Anderson. Adele excelled in school, earning a full scholarship to Princeton. She was a talented writer and artist, playing several instruments, singing, painting, drawing, and designing and making clothes.
Adele joined the US Army in 1973. She was assigned to the Army Language School in Monterey, California, where she learned to speak Russian. She later served as a Russian interpreter attached to the National Security Agency. She was honorably discharged in 1977.
A vibrant woman, Adele was fondly called Dellie by her loved ones. She raised her daughter and sons in Maine near her family, where she was not only a mother to her children, but also a caregiver to her nieces and nephew as well their friends and neighborhood playmates.
Nothing was ordinary with Dellie - she loved to make things special. She made everything from after-school treats to Halloween costumes. She helped with homework and with growing pains and was a wonderful teacher and mentor. Picnics and beach days were a favorite as she taught stories, songs, and games. Her love for nature, animals, books, history, and art lives on in all her children.
Dellie was diagnosed with lung cancer in January, 2016. Although her body was taken quickly, her spirit endured and it was evident that the love she had spread throughout her life would remain in the lives of those whom she had touched. When she passed, her daughter wrote: Rest in peace sweet mama. I will never forget your tiny hands that were capable of so much beauty, comfort, creation, love, talent and inspiration.
A parade of people visited Dellie during her last days to say goodbye to their friend and "second mother", a phrase that was heard many, many times.
Those who remain to celebrate her life include: her children, James "Jamie" Anderson McRorie (Marianne McRorie); Katherine "Katie" Anderson Cook (Steve Cook); Charles "Chuck" Anderson; her siblings, David Anderson (Valerie Anderson); Bruce Anderson (Elizabeth Anderson); William Anderson (Heather MacGregor); and her best friend, Jerrilynn Sanford.
No service is being planned. Dellie was cremated and her ashes will be spread in her favorite places in Maine, Nova Scotia, and California. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Bangor Humane Society.

Texto completo:   Lucas Chansler, 32, of St. Johns, Florida, was convicted of masquerading online as a 15-year-old and coercingmore than 350teenage girls to send him naked pictures. The FBI was only able to identify about 100of those victims across 26 states, CBS 13 investigative reporter Jon Chrisos reported Monday, and the agency is involved in an ongoing search for the rest, including in Maine.
"We are very concerned about it," Special Agent Aaron Steps, who oversees the three FBI offices in Maine, told Chrisos."The nature of this crime is such that the impact on the victim is often as bad or severe as a hands-on offense."
Arizona woman Ashley Reynolds, 20, was one of Chansler's victims. She was 14 when he started contacting her, seemingly out of the blue. He told her he had nude pictures of her and threatened to distribute them publicly unless she sent him more. Over the past year, Reynolds has been telling her story publicly in hopes of spreading awareness about so-called "sextortion" plots and helping the FBI find more of Chansler's victims around the country.
"He was almost manipulating my mind to believe that he did have some pictures of me," she later told CNN. "So I didn't know, maybe I had my laptop up, and maybe [he was able to hack into my computer camera while] I was changing or something like that."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixAYkkub4Pw
An impressionable teen, Reynolds said she sent Chansler a few photographs in hopes that he'd be satisfied and leave her alone, but then she was hooked -- at that point, he really did have pictures and leverage to blackmail her. He demanded as many as 60 pictures a night.
Chrisos reported that, during sentencing, a judge calledChansler "cruel, cold and unapologetic -- teenage girls begging, literally begging him not to make them do more photos." He was sentenced to 105 years in prison, but federal agents still have work to do finding victims and trying to bring the wide-ranging case to a conclusion.
"We are continually looking for additional victims in order to provide services and track down material that's out there," Steps told CBS 13.
The bureau is also using the high-profile case as a way to remind parents and teenagers to be careful with the Internet and technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miR-8uBbVrU
In most cases, the FBI saysapredator claiming to have photos actually does not, but acknowledges some are able to hack into phones and webcams, Chrisos reported. Law enforcement officialsrecommend people not keep phones and computers in bedrooms, and if theydo, cover the camera.
Cases of sextortion are not new to Maine. In 2014, John Villegas, then 23, of Kittery was sentenced to 33 months in prison for one count of cyber stalking after stealing a female acquaintance's laptop, thenthreatened to send explicit photos he found of her on the device to friends and colleagues.
Justice Department prosecutor Mona Sedky said at the time that for Villegas' victim, "it was really no different than someone being present with a weapon and trying to make her take her clothes off."

In wake of poaching controversy, Jackson challenges LePage to drug test

Texto completo:   ALLAGASH, Maine - It is no secret to anyone who follows Maine news, or in some cases national news, that Governor LePage (R) and former Maine Senator and current candidate for Senate Troy Jackson (D) will not be heading out to a hunting camp on the Allagash Wilderness Waterway together for some man-bonding anytime ever.
The two's mutual animosity was recently featured in a comedic video short on the HBO program "Last Week Tonight," which invoked the notorious "vaseline comment," Governor LePage leveled at Jackson when Jackson was serving as Senate Majority Leader.
The latest dispute between the public servants involves comments the Governor made on the George Hale Ric Tyler Show on WVOM, May 10, in which he addressed a controversial Portland Press Herald article. The tone of the article criticizes Maine Game Wardens for their handling of an undercover investigation which netted several hunting violation convictions of Allagash residents.
During the interview, the governor suggested that Jackson made a claim about Allagash residents engaging in illegal activities such as drinking and driving and smoking marijuana on a regular basis.
"Troy Jackson made claim to that's the way we live up here it's not a big deal we drink beer in vehicles and we smoke pot I was sort of surprised to see a senator say that but, or a former senator," Governor LePage said.
As a result of the Governor's comments, Jackson posted a photo of himself standing in front of the Allagash town sign, holding laboratory results indicating that he himself had passed an illegal drug screening test. Jackson posted the test results on his Facebook page, where he challenged the Governor to do the same.
"The Governor just throws out this accusation or comment about how I say that everyone up here is riding around drinking and smoking dope. I never said that and I certainly don't believe that. It is disparaging to the people up here," Jackson said.
Jackson added that when a representative of the radio show called to discuss the Governor's comments, he decided to post the photo of the recent Medtox results, from a test Jackson had taken as part of an application for a temporary job.
"My first response was 'Look, I'm more than happy to get drug tested. If the governor wants to go with me we'll see who is on the up and up.'"
Surely even Governor LePage would acknowledge Jackson's history of demonstrating a vigorous passion for the Allagash community which has been home to five or six generations of Jackson's ancestors, both maternal and paternal. Such rich ancestral ties to the woodsy town also apply to Jackson's partner with whom he shares two adults sons, Lana Pelletier.
"I'm looking at my wife's family house down the field from me. Her mother's on the back porch right now," Jackson pointed out.
"It is an easier way up here. It's not unheard of for people to ride around on the dirt roads, but that's not to say that people are driving around drinking and hunting. I wasn't even in the article -- I had nothing to do with it. For him to say Troy Jackson says it's okay to ride around drinking and smoking dope -- I never said that and I don't agree with it."
Jackson acknowledged that some folks in Allagash are not perfectly law abiding, as with any town, but the image of a town perpetually engaged in a drug and alcohol fueled backwoods free for all is far from an accurate representation of the Allagash demographic.
"The reality is, yes, they caught three people -- great. They broke the law and that is what it is, but most of the people up here if they're not elderly because it's become such an elderly community, the rest of them are loggers and stuff like that out cutting wood or driving trucks. They're trying to make a living in a hard industry that I would mention the Governor has done nothing to help them with. He's done everything to make it harder for them to make a living in the logging industry."
The governor did mention in the podcast that he felt the author of the Portland Press Herald article in question "misrepresented" the people of Allagash in the story and in doing so provided a "disservice to the Allagash community."
"They're not as backward as he seemed to indicate." He also said he plans to participate in a town hall in Fort Kent in the near future and recognized that people living in the northernmost part of the state often feel "there are two Maines."
Jackson said he feels the long-standing feud between he and Governor LePage stems from Jackson's refusal to play the role of yes-man to LePage, when the two worked together at the Capitol.
"I wouldn't just go along and be 'yes Governor, you're right Governor. I wasn't intimidated by him and he doesn't like that. He's had a lifetime of running businesses and he thinks in this role he's a CEO that gets to say whatever he wants and people just have to quiver in fear. That don't impress me much."
Governor LePage declined to be interviewed for this story, but his press secretary implied in an email that the Governor will not be posting his own drug test results in front of the Blaine House.
"We are not going to comment further regarding the Warden-related allegations. The original story is in large part erroneous, which the Warden Service has provided response based on facts As for Mr. Jackson's request, it is clearly a desperate attempt to be relevant."
Jackson said he was not expecting the Governor would accept his drug test challenge.
"He makes accusations and is not willing to back them up. He's a typical bully that once he's challenged he backs down."

Texto completo:   TROY, Maine -- Since the Troy Union Church was built 175 years ago on the Bangor Road, its bell has rung out countless times to mark important moments in the town.
But the bell has essentially been silent since July 4, 1976, because the church's rotting, listing bell tower has made it unsafe to ring it vigorously. On Thursday morning, May 12, the long silence was broken when the bell rang while being lowered to the ground by a 30-ton crane. As it rang, the crew of hardworking men and a small crowd watching the show from across the road spontaneously burst into cheers.
The joyful noise of the old bell seemed to underscore a sense of optimism that the long effort to restore the historic, Greek Revival church is really getting somewhere good at last.
"It's been a long time since the bell was rung," said Jan Copley, who lives across the street from the church and who has attended services there for many years. "I think the restoration can't be done soon enough."
So far, a small group of parishioners led by Norma Rossel of Troy has spent six years and raised $107,000 to fix the church, which has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Rossel has applied for and received thousands of dollars in grants and spearheaded a church capital campaign to raise local dollars to assess, stabilize and replace the rotten tower. Although the work may still take a couple of years to complete, what happened Thursday is exciting to the Troy Union Church congregants and restorers alike. The workers used the crane to carefully lift off the bell and the remains of the rotten bell tower, work that has to be done before the tower can be rebuilt.
"If people don't take care of their heritage, it's gone," Rossel said. "Now, it'll last another 200 years."
Arron Sturgis of Preservation Timber Framing, a Berwick-based company that specializes in traditional repair of steeples, barns and timber-framed homes, has been working on the restoration effort for several years. He looked pleased as the work progressed -- carefully -- Thursday.
"It's always a little dangerous. When you have a damaged building of this degree, something could come apart. It's extremely rotten," he said. "Everything to date has just been preparation. Now we're in the middle of the river, and we can't stop now."
Because the church has a tiny congregation of just a dozen or so people and doesn't have the money to pay his company to do the whole job, Sturgis and his crew trained three local carpenters to do some of the work. The men were employed all winter building wooden trusses to replace the rotten ones, and one of them is storing the cast iron bell at his home until the replacement trusses and the rest of the bell tower components can be put in place. That should happen soon, Rossel said -- perhaps by early June.
"The goal here was to save money by training and employing local craftsmen," Sturgis said, adding that he hopes the skills they learned can be used on other projects. "There's so much church steeple work in Maine right now, we couldn't begin to do it all."
After the bell tower has been replaced and the church's structural integrity has been restored, Rossel and the congregation will work on fixing the sanctuary, which is gutted and is unusable. The Troy Union Church is clearly a work in progress, but bit by bit, it is getting there.
"It's not about the building. It's about the people and the faith," explained Sandy Fernald of Troy, a church member who watched the bell get lifted down. "But it's great, the restoration and the legacy. Everyone is so quick to tear buildings down and put up a double-wide [trailer], but history is important. We're thinking about the future generations."

Chef at newly opened Scales balances New England classics with contemporary tastes

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- When Scales opened on the Maine Wharf in March, there was substantial buzz in the foodie community. But amid the barrage of tweets, Instagram images and shoutouts to co-owner Sam Hayward, the actual chef cranking out the lobster dishes was largely invisible.
When you meet Scales executive chef Mike Smith, it's hard to imagine how that could be. His large frame, confident manner and bright tattoos don't exactly say shrinking violet. Overseeing this large, multiplex kitchen that serves 145 in the winter and 200 in the summer, demands acute presence of mind and skill to navigate the flow.
"You are an air traffic controller is basically what you are. You have to be able to think very quickly," said Smith.
The 32-year-old Old Orchard Beach native is no stranger to seafood, restaurant life or hard work. He graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in New York, worked in Boston and Napa Valley, yet his path to the helm of this kitchen began earlier, and closer to home.
At 14 he was hired as a dishwasher at Joseph's By the Sea in Old Orchard Beach. "At first I hated it. Standing up, getting dirty, getting wet. But you get acclimated to what's going on," he said. "I learned to love it."
For the next few summers, till he was 17, he returned and quickly graduated from dishwasher to top spots in the kitchen. "I always loved food and that was the fancy place we would go to as a family," he said.
Now Smith is in charge of Portland's newest fancy dining place located in the tourist hub where hordes will descend this summer. Owned by Dana Street, who also owns Portland's Mediterranean seafood restaurant Street and Co., and Sam Hayward, the James Beard winning chef behind Fore Street, Scales' reputation precedes it.
"I was humbled to sit in a room with Sam Hayward and Dana Street. Growing up in Maine, Fore Street is the quintessential Maine restaurant," said Smith, who interviewed for the job in August and was hired in October.
The menu at Scales, which features a raw bar, seafood, chowders, stews and steak, is Smith's creation. "Sam Hayward gave me a base menu and I went from there. I knew we had to have a lobster roll [and] had to have fried clams," he said. But Smith, who worked for six and a half years for celebrity chef Ken Oringer at Boston hot spot Toro, was eager to add his stamp.
"People come to Maine and expect lobster and clams. But places like Central Provisions are taking it in a new direction. I'm trying to do both of those things at the same time," said Smith. "Yeah, we have lobsters, we have steamers, but we also have these other things that aren't New England classics that we would like you to try," Smith said.
Fried squid with cherry peppers, salt and pepper fried sunchokes and a new take on fish stew are chief among them. Fried po boy sandwiches and soft shell crabs -- "things that we get excited about" -- are in the works.
Street, a Massachusetts native who envisioned a cross between Durgin Park and the Union Oyster House for his new venture, is intent to "keep what's classic, classic." That means lobster rolls are not sporting the trendiest ingredient, but are tweaked for today's sophisticated dinner.
"He adds a riff, as in jazz, [to classic New England fare]," said Street, who is also a partner in Portland's Standard Baking Co. No surprise that Scales' pastry department is full fledged.
The lobster roll starts with housemade buns. "We cut and griddle the buns, cook lobster meat in a combi oven, which doesn't overcook lobster," Smith explains. "We cook the claws and tails separately. All the moisture goes back into the lobster. We heat it up in melted butter that's been emulsified. It's delicious."
Smith's fish and shellfish stew is a departure from the traditional clam chowder his mother made with leftover steamers from family clambakes. "We use fresh squid that has not been frozen (it still has the ink sack in it), clams and mussels and tomato fennel broth," he said. "It's based on cioppino or bouillabaisse. We add chili butter and serve it with grilled bread. It's fresh and kind of spicy, it's all about the flavor you get out of the seafood. It's served in a big awesome cast iron pan."
Moving back to Portland in 2014, Smith worked at Duckfat in the front of the house, but soon missed the creativity of cooking for an audience. In Scales' huge, shiny new kitchen, he's back where he belongs.
Hayward is impressed with Smith's "raw talent," drive and poise under fire. "We think a lot alike. We talk the same way about food," said Hayward.
"With his strength of personality and skill, I'm surprised how young he is in both his breadth and depth of knowledge," said Hayward. "We are happy to have him on board."
Although this top post would seem like a dream job for a kid from Old Orchard Beach, his real dream is to run his own place. "You can't keep a guy like that down," said Hayward.
To be sure, overseeing a powerhouse, marque spot open seven days a week on the water is high pressure. Smith, who is quick with a smile and keeps a jug of iced coffee by his side, was cut out for this role.
"I am very humbled to be able to do this job," he said. "To be back home, it's a labor of love."

Texto completo:   WEST FORKS, Maine -- A Massachusetts man died while on a rafting trip in West Forks Plantation, a Maine Warden Service official said.
Michael Arena, 52, was on a commercial rafting trip with North Country Rivers when he fell out of the raft Saturday, Cpl. John MacDonald said.
Arena's group was going through a series of Dead River rapids when he fell out. He was declared dead at the scene.
Arena had been chaperoning a group of four Boy Scouts, including his son. There were seven people in the raft -- two chaperones, four teenage boys and one guide -- MacDonald said.
The raft was being operated in accordance to state law. MacDonald said it has been several years since a rafting fatality has occurred in Maine.
The cause of death has not yet been determined and the incident remains under investigation.

Texto completo:   NEW BRUNSWICK - Despite having to juggle a heart-pounding schedule, George Street Playhouse Artistic Director David Saint said he has had a great deal of input in an upcoming season filled with new works that make him extremely proud.
Marking Saint's 20th anniversary with George Street, the season launches Oct. 18 with "Mama's Boy," a gripping family drama about Lee Harvey Oswald and his mother, Marguerite. Saint said he was introduced to Rob Urbinati's play by Betsy Aidem, who starred in the female tour de force's world premiere in Maine, as well as "Jolson Sings Again" in 1999 and "God of Carnage" in 2011 at George Street. Like those George Street productions, Saint will direct "Mama's Boy."
He said, "Betsy is a wonderful actress, and it's a fascinating play with a fantastic role for a woman. ... Marguerite is like a cross between Amanda from 'Glass Menagerie' and Medea, the kind of role an actress would die to get their teeth into. ... I'm hoping it will go on to have a future either around the country or in New York or both.
"I love opening the season with a new play, especially something that makes a splash," Saint continued. "With all the volatile, fictionlike characters going on in our current presidential race, I thought it would be great to have this play just before the election."
'American Son'
Running through Nov. 6, "Mama's Boy" will be the only production Saint will have time to direct, but the season's second play, Christopher Demos-Brown's "American Son," has the director's thumb print all over it.
Saint is president of the Laurents/Hatcher Foundation, which honors his mentor, Tony-winning playwright-director Arthur Laurents, and his partner of more than 50 years, Tom Hatcher. Each year since Laurents' 2011 death, the foundation has awarded $1 million in grants, including $150,000 to a production of new work by an emerging playwright.
This year, Brown and Barrington Stage Co. won for "American Son," which will have its world premiere next month in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The riveting look at race relations will be staged Feb. 7 to 26 at George Street.
"Because of the foundation, I am constantly looking at new plays," Saint said. "I was blown away by 'American Son' and how it deals with race in America. It reads like a thriller, it's so fast-moving."
Saint also is busy directing or helping to produce Laurents' two best-known scripts, "West Side Story" and "Gypsy." He is directing a production of "West Side Story" that will be staged in July at the 18,000-seat Hollywood Bowl. He also is serving as an executive producer of a film version of "West Side Story," directed by Steven Spielberg, as well as Barry Levinson's remake of "Gypsy," starring Barbra Streisand as Mama Rose.
Eclectic season
Yet, Saint's "notorious" schedule hasn't stopped him from creating an eclectic season that will delight subscribers with its variety. The remainder includes:
"Bad Jews," a dark comedy that pits two cousins against in each other in the inheritance of their grandfather's prized necklace, March 21 to April 9
A Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Award-nominated musical adaptation of Jean Webster's 1912 novel, "Daddy Long Legs."
A fifth offering may be a large musical production, Saint said. He said he wanted to keep the schedule flexible.
Saint will be on hand for George Street's black-tie gala that will honor The Actors Fund and President-CEO Joseph P. Benincasa at 5 p.m. May 22 across Livingston Avenue from the theater at The Heldrich Hotel. The evening will include stars of stage and screen, as well as corporate, civic and social leaders from throughout Central Jersey. To RSVP or for sponsorship opportunities, contact Steve Barry at sbarry@georgestplayhouse.org or 732-846-2895, ext. 144.
Five-play subscriptions for the forthcoming season are on sale starting at $115. Group discounts also are available at 732-246-7717 and www.GSPonline.org.

Texto completo:   Keynote speakers for Maine Startup and Create Week in late June. Friday's speaker, Forbes Media President Mike Perlis, has a local tie, as he began his career as founder of a special interest publisher in Camden, should we want to use a picture.
Maine Startup and Create Week has recruited a diverse group of big thinkers to serve as keynote speakers at its entrepreneurial showcase set for June 20-24.
The speakers, including two startup founders with Maine ties, were picked to help encourage Maine residents who want to develop high-growth, high-impact companies to flourish in a state that is geared toward more traditional small-business models, said event founder Jess Knox, a Portland-based business consultant. Mainers excel at launching small businesses, and hard work, but often lack the opportunity to hear from people "who have big aspirations to grow a world-class company," Knox said.
Speakers include Mimi Chun, a startup founder and designer who helps find funding for startups; Rodney Sampson, a serial startup founder who launched an Atlanta-based innovation incubator; Sampriti Bhattacharyya, a young roboticist who designed an underwater drone to detect cracks in nuclear reactor tanks; Robyn Kanner, an Amazon designer whose company is helping transgender people find health care; and Forbes Media President Mike Perlis, who achieved record growth for the century-old company with startup techniques.
Kanner is a former Portland resident, and Perlis began his media career as co-founder of New England Publications in Camden.
To buy tickets or to see a schedule of events, go to mainestartupandcreateweek.com. Keynote addresses run from 12:30 to 1:45 p.m. at the Maine College of Art in Portland.
Through the end of the month, tickets cost $400 for the week, $150 for a day, and $15 to hear a keynote speaker over lunch, which can be purchased for an additional $20. Tickets to all five lunches cost $60.
Maine Startup and Create Week began in 2014. The schedule of workshops, addresses and networking celebrates design thinking and business innovation. Penelope Overton can be contacted at 791-6463 or at: poverton@pressherald.com Twitter: PLOvertonPPH

Texto completo:   summit on impaired driving, sponsored by AAA Northern New England and the state Board of Highway Safety, focuses on the use of marijuana and other drugs as a factor in impaired driving incidents.
Prosecutors, police officers and traffic safety experts say more education about the danger of drug-impaired driving is needed as Maine, which is dealing with a heroin epidemic, considers legalizing marijuana for recreational use.
The issue of drug-impaired driving was the focus of a summit in Portland on Monday that brought together people in law enforcement to look at new research and approaches to dealing with drivers who are under the influence.
While alcohol is still the primary intoxicant for people behind the wheel, more people are also using marijuana, prescription drugs and heroin while driving, said experts who spoke at the summit hosted by AAA Northern New England and the Maine Bureau of Highway Safety.
"Back in the early '80s, we were in the same crisis with OUI alcohol as we are today with OUI drugs," said Col. Robert Williams, chief of the Maine State Police. "We have no idea how big the problem is."
The summit came less than a week after AAA released a new study that finds blood tests are useless for detecting incidents of drivers operating under the influence while using pot, and as Maine voters consider whether to legalize recreational marijuana. It also comes at a time when police are dealing with a surge in heroin use - last year there were 272 fatal drug overdoses in the state - and as aging Maine residents are using more prescription drugs that could impair their ability to safely drive, experts say. Last year, 70 million pills were prescribed in Maine.
Williams said Maine needs to be better prepared to deal with the prospect of legalized recreational marijuana as Mainers face a vote on the issue in November. Maine, which has allowed medical marijuana since 1999, could join Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia in allowing adult use of marijuana. Williams believes the number of arrests for operating under the influence will spike if Maine legalizes marijuana.
"In other states that have (legal marijuana), they'll tell you, as prepared as they thought they were, they were so unprepared they can't count the ways," Williams said.
Fatal crashes involving drivers who recently used marijuana doubled in Washington after that state legalized the drug, according to AAA. In 2013, nearly 13 percent of weekend nighttime drivers had evidence of marijuana in their systems, up from 9 percent in 2007.
Police currently use a roadside drug recognition exam to detect impairment from drugs, but experts say more resources and better tools are needed to stop drugged driving, as the culture becomes more accepting of marijuana use. There are about 90 drug recognition experts across the state and more are needed to deal with the number of impaired drivers, law enforcement officials said at the summit.
Jake Nelson, director of traffic safety, advocacy and research for AAA, said drug-impaired driving is a complex issue because of a lack of solid information about the extent of the problem, both in Maine and across the country.
"We're painting the plane as we fly it when it comes to drug-impaired driving," he said.
AAA is advocating for laws that allow permissible inference of marijuana impairment - or the assumption that someone is impaired if he or she shows signs of it - rather than laws that set a chemical limit for the amount of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, in a person's blood while driving. Experts say it is difficult to set legal limits for the concentration of THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, in the blood because THC affects everyone differently and is detectable in tests long after a person stops being impaired.
The Maine Legislature considered a bill to set a 5-nanogram limit in drivers' blood, but it was rejected by the House last month. Currently, six states - Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington - have set specific limits for THC, the Associated Press reported.
Nelson said drivers operating vehicles while using legally obtained prescription drugs is another issue law enforcement needs to tackle, especially in states like Maine with aging populations. Eight out of 10 drivers over the age of 65 take medication on a regular basis and 69 percent take a drug known to impair driving, he said.
"This is a huge problem and one people aren't talking about because nobody knows what to do about it," he said.
Marianne Lynch, assistant district attorney for Penobscot County, and Detective Sgt. Andrew Whitehouse of the Penobscot County Sheriff's Office, say more education about impaired driving is needed as Maine considers legalizing marijuana and as the county deals with heroin and methamphetamine problems. Lynch said some drivers believe they are unaffected and fine to drive when their ability to safely drive is actually diminished.
Whitehouse said he is also concerned about the amount of prescription drugs being taken by drivers because they aren't being advised about waiting to see how they are affected by a new medication. He said events like Monday's summit are helpful for police to develop strategies to deal with these concerns.
"Anytime we get together with prosecutors and other police officers and talk about how to deal with this, it's a win-win for us," Whitehouse said. Gillian Graham can be contacted at 791-6315 or at: ggraham@pressherald.com Twitter: grahamgillian

Texto completo:   The issue of using drones at high school athletic events in Maine is starting to be addressed.
The Maine Principals' Association has decided to prohibit the use of unmanned aerial systems, also known as drones, at all the high school athletic events it sponsors, mostly playoff and championship games.
The MPA policy, which will take effect at the start of the next school year, will not affect regular-season games, such as a varsity football game between Deering High School and South Portland High School.
Members approved the drone policy at their spring conference last month, hoping to stay ahead of an issue that is currently being considered by high schools in Maine and across the nation.
Thornton Academy in Saco is believed to have become the first high school in Maine to adopt a drone policy when it decided in April to prohibit all remote aircraft from being used on or flown over school property without written permission.
A national organization that has been monitoring drone use says that while drone technology can be used for good purposes, many school districts worry that a drone could crash into a crowd of spectators or be used by coaches to gain a competitive advantage.
"If a drone should crash, it could kill or injure people. Or even worse, it could be carrying a payload," said Dr. Lou Marciani, director of the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. "People are concerned because safety should always come first."
Marciani said the use of drones at high school athletic events has become one of the hottest issues facing schools across the nation. It was the subject of a panel discussion at the center's safety and security summit April 13-15.
Marciani said more high schools are banning the use of drones at school athletic events. He said school boards and superintendents are struggling with enacting restrictions as drones become more commonly used.
"If I am a school superintendent, I'm nervous about this," he said. "Because there is no way to detect them or to determine if they are dangerous."
The MPA first became aware of the drone issue because of concerns they could be used as a scouting tool, giving schools that had them an unfair advantage.
"It was a football request, an (athletic director) had received word that one of the opponents had a drone," said Mike Burnham, the MPA's assistant executive director. However, the policy was put in place more as a proactive measure than as a response to an ongoing problem, he said.
Burnham said Vermont, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin, Maryland and Ohio are among the states that have adopted policies forbidding drones at high school athletic events.
Jim Trask, Thornton Academy's director of campus safety, believes the private school is the first high school in Maine to have adopted a policy regulating drone use. In an email, Trask said that the school policy prohibits "any and all remote aircraft use on or over Thornton Academy property during and after school hours. This policy was written with the safety and security of our students, staff, visitors and campus in mind."
"Our concern is for the privacy of our students, as well as concerns over injuries and damage that may occur with one of these devices," said Trask, a former Maine State Trooper. "Since Thornton Academy is private property it makes it much easier to control this issue and refuse to allow these devices on campus."
Gary Stevens is Thornton Academy's athletic director. He also serves on the advisory board of the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security. Stevens attended the center's April conference in Mississippi.
"Drones, I would say, are one of the top-three hot topics for the center," Stevens said. "Thornton Academy recently developed our own policy. I had a drone appear on campus the last week of April. I saw the drone at the tennis court."
"So now if you want to use a drone on our 88-acre property, you have to apply for permission from the director of security. That includes teachers using it for science," Stevens said.
Stevens said the safety issue is a big concern with drones, as are the ethical questions surrounding the use of drones by school teams to videotape an opponent.
"I think for high school athletics in Maine, the drone will become the tool for athletic teams to use for practice. It could be used very effectively to teach kids. You could use videos from it. But you do have ethical questions and you want to make sure you are only videotaping your own practice and not getting into other schools' air space," Stevens said. "I hope it never gets to that point."
The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed a set of rules for three categories of drones: public operations, civil operations and model aircraft. Civil operations, or commercial use, requires authorization from the FAA. The policy for model aircraft, or recreational use, strongly urges hobbyists to follow seven safety measures.
In addition, the U.S. Senate last month approved an FAA reauthorization bill that would require people who buy drones to take an online test of their knowledge of restrictions and proper handling of their aircraft, the Washington Post reported. The FAA already requires registration of drones. The bill awaits consideration in the House. Spectators interviewed Monday at a baseball game and girls' lacrosse match in Scarborough said drones are currently not a problem in Maine.
"I've never seen a drone over a playing field so it's hard to believe it's an issue," said Stu Jacobs, whose son Alex Jacobs is a pitcher for Cheverus High School. "I could see if it was a football game and the stands were full, then it could be a hazard. But at this point, I think they are addressing a problem that doesn't exist."
George Koukos was watching his daughter Haley play for Scarborough's junior varsity lacrosse team.
"I've never seen one so I don't know how much of an issue it is. I think it would be an issue over airports. But a ball field?"
"If we've had drones I've never noticed them," said Mike LeGage, Scarborough's athletic director. "But I probably need to put something in our student handbook now."

Texto completo:   SKOWHEGAN -- An organization aimed at promoting the separation of church and state says it is concerned about a lack of transparency surrounding a Christian afterschool club at a town elementary school and has scheduled a discussion for parents this week.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation wants "to let parents know what they're doing at the Good News Club so that they can make an informed decision," said FFRF Maine Chapter President Tom Waddell. The discussion is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Margaret Chase Smith Elementary School library and is open to the public.
The Good News Club, which is in 67 schools around the state, is run by the Child Evangelism Fellowship, an organization whose goal is to "evangelize boys and girls with the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and to establish (disciple) them in the Word of God and in a local church for Christian living," according to the group's website.
It has been in place in Skowhegan-based School Administrative District 54 "for a number of years," according to district Superintendent Brent Colbry. The club meets at the Bloomfield Elementary School, though in the past it has met in other SAD 54 elementary schools. The district serves students in Canaan, Cornville, Mercer, Norridgewock, Skowhegan and Smithfield.
In October 2014, some parents complained about fliers that were being sent home with students promoting the Good News Club and FFRF has since been working towards holding a community discussion, Waddell said.
The district does not distribute business fliers or advertisements, but does allow promotional material for nonprofit groups or recreation programs that meet at the school to distribute materials to students after the materials are reviewed by school officials.
According to a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of Good News Club vs. Milford Central School District, schools may not discriminate against religious groups, which are allowed to have the same access to school property that other outside groups get.
While the Good News Club has a legal right to meet at public schools, Waddell said the group is not being transparent about what goes on at club meetings and that the district could benefit from policies requiring it to be more open.
"Kids read the invitation, which basically says, 'Come have some fun with your friends and learn a little about the Bible,' so they say 'yes,' but when they get home, they say things to their parents like, 'We're all going to hell because we're worshiping the wrong god,' and the parents say, 'Where did you hear that?' " Waddell said.
He said the district should update its policies around flier distribution and facility use as well as better enforce anti-bullying and anti-discrimination policies as they relate to religion.
Brad Walker, local director of the Central Maine chapter of the Child Evangelism Fellowship of Maine, said he believes the group is transparent. The brochure about the club that gets sent home to students "specifically references our belief in Jesus and the Bible, and says we will be teaching Biblical principles," Walker said.
He also said that while the club is open to all students in SAD 54, signed parental permission is required for student participation.
"I feel the brochure states what we are doing," he said. "It tells what the Good News Club is, what will be taught, who sponsors it, where the club is held, so after reading the brochure I feel parents would know we are a Bible club and that we have a Christian view."

Texto completo:   As part of a national draw-down of National Guard troops, Maine will lose 100 positions, most of them part time, all of them unfilled.
The impact of a 4.3 percent cut in National Guard troops at the federal level means Maine will lose about 120 positions over the next three years, although no soldiers will be laid off.
A Maine National Guard spokesman, Sgt. 1st Class Peter Morrison, confirmed Monday that the reduction in troops will take place through attrition, with some of those happening already.
For the current fiscal year, 40 positions will be eliminated, followed by 76 positions the next year and three in 2018. Only 20 of those positions are full-time.
Maine currently has roughly 2,400 Army Guard members, 500 of them full-time employees.
Brig. Gen. Doug Farnham, who was appointed by Gov. Paul LePage in December to lead the Maine National Guard, spoke about the reduction at an event Friday. Farnham was not available for comment Monday, but provided a statement.
"The Maine Army National Guard share of these cuts is approximately 120 positions over three years. No Maine Guardsmen will lose their position in a unit as we will manage any losses through attrition," Farnham said. "It is hard to give the exact units that will be affected as the Army National Guard Force Management personnel are working very hard to support the modernization of our forces.
"We have a great working relationship with all involved, and seek to modernize equipment and capabilities throughout our units. Regardless of the units or their slight reductions, none of the authorizations we lose will create a job loss."
According to a news release in November from the Army National Guard, the reduction in overall troops is expected to happen gradually through September 2017, from 350,200 soldiers down to 335,000.
"This is an overall Army effort to match our force structure to the resources available," Army Lt. Gen. Timothy J. Kadavy, director of the Army Guard, said in a statement. "Our goal is to achieve these planned reductions through normal attrition rates as soldiers depart from the Army Guard."
As part of that, several units will be "inactivated" over the next two years, Kadavy said.
Although none of those units are from Maine, "this level of force structure change will mean turbulence to all 54 states, territories and the District of Columbia," he said.
"When completed we will be a smaller Army and Army National Guard, so there will be risk in the speed and size of a response we can provide to governors in emergencies," Kadavy said. "But we believe we have taken the right approach to ensuring the (Army Guard) can be ready for both our national and state missions."
Last year, Maine faced the possibility of losing the 133rd Engineer Battalion after then-Brig. Gen. James Campbell tried to initiate a swap of Maine's engineers with an infantry unit from another state. That plan fell through after it was revealed Campbell misled the public, and LePage, about his intentions regarding the 133rd.
LePage eventually fired Campbell and appointed Gen. Gerard Bolduc as the interim leader of the guard. Bolduc was then named by LePage to replace Campbell permanently but later withdrew his name for personal reasons. LePage then nominated Farnham, who had been a high-ranking leader of the Maine Air National Guard, based in Bangor.
Shortly before Bolduc removed his name from consideration for the permanent post, it was announced that Maine would not lose the 133rd Engineer Battalion, after all.
Farnham pointed out Monday that force structure is "never static," and fluctuates annually depending on needs at the federal level. Eric Russell can be contacted at 791-6344 or at: erussell@pressherald.com Twitter: PPHEricRussell

Texto completo:   As the economy continues to recover in southern Maine, the construction industry is experiencing growing pains, particularly the shortage of skilled labor. Whereas a few years ago the challenge was finding enough projects to keep busy, nowadays there are projects but a shortage of skilled workers to help complete them. The labor shortage has caused the delay of many projects.
Commercial contractors in southern Maine say they are having trouble hiring experienced construction workers because many have fled for better-paying jobs outside the state.
Their departure, prompted in part by years of relatively little new construction in Maine, has made it harder to revive the industry now that more private and public interests are building projects again. The labor shortage also has suppressed competitive bidding in Maine and caused the delay of several projects.
Matthew Marks, CEO of the Associated General Contractors of Maine, a trade organization that represents 180 member companies, said the problem began two recessions ago in 2000, when construction in Maine reached a peak, followed by a sharp decline.
"We lost a ton of talent - 10,000 people out the door," Marks said. "Those are the people that would have been training the modern workforce. They left."
The problem worsened during the Great Recession that began in December 2007 and prompted many Maine contractors to downsize, consolidate with other firms or shut down completely, he said. Thousands of workers lost their jobs or were unable to find enough work to sustain their households in Maine.
According to Maine Department of Labor data, there were 5,171 specialty contractors in the state at the end of 2001. There were 3,389 by the end of 2015, a 34 percent decline.
At the time of the recent recession, commercial construction workers in Maine were making an average of about $45,000 a year, Marks said, so the exodus was driven by a lack of work, and not by low pay.
"I know people that have told us we lost a good portion of our people to the Boston market," Marks said. "People have to feed their family at the end of the day. They have to keep a roof over their head."
PAY TOO LOW TO LURE BACK WORKERS
Now that southern Maine is experiencing a resurgence of private-sector construction - including new hotels, condominiums and senior housing - it may be nearly impossible to lure back those skilled workers.
One reason is the significant difference in pay. As of May 2015, the mean hourly wage for construction laborers in Maine was $14.53, or $30,230 a year, the lowest in New England and 42 percent lower than the mean hourly wage of $25.06, or $52,120 a year, in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Another issue is the reluctance of Maine construction companies to hire more full-time staff, even though the industry is recovering, Marks said.
"There is a sentiment out there of, 'What will happen if there's another downturn in the future? How many people should we bring on?' " he said. "Nobody likes to lay people off."
The problem is occurring nationally as well. Construction employment totaled 6.7 million workers in April, the highest level since December 2008, but still isn't sufficient to meet demand, said Ken Simonson, chief economist for Associated General Contractors of America. Although the association is seeing more construction spending, there is also a worsening worker shortage, which prompted the association to launch a new online job portal this month.
"Reports from contractors and recent Census Bureau data on construction spending through March suggest industry demand for workers will remain robust, if firms can find employees with the right skills," Simonson said in a news release.
One consequence of the subcontractor shortage is that construction clients are receiving fewer competitive bids, and are likely paying more as a result.
In April, the deadline passed for competitive bids on the $100.2 million Sanford High School and Regional Technical Center, considered the most expensive project of its type in Maine's history.
Seven general contractors pre-qualified to bid on the project. The district received only two bids, and it ultimately awarded the master contract to an out-of-state firm, New Hampshire-based Hutter Construction. A Maine company, Gorham-based Shaw Brothers Construction, won a $14.1 million contract to perform all of the pre-construction preparatory work on the 127-acre project site.
District Superintendent David Theoharides said he has been told that one reason more companies didn't bid is a state requirement that the winning contractor pay a $12,000 penalty for every day the project goes past its Aug. 1, 2018, completion deadline. There was a concern that difficulty finding subcontractors could lead to delays and missing the deadline.
The district also received a paucity of bids on other components of the project. For instance, it received only a single bid for drywall installation, Theoharides said.
"I think the subcontractor on the drywall knew they were the only one, because boy did they come in high (with their bid)," he said.
Consigli Construction Co. in Portland is one of the general contractors that was pre-qualified to bid on the Sanford school and ultimately decided against it.
Matt Tonello, project executive and operations manager at the firm's Portland office, said one reason was a concern that the lack of competitive bidding by subcontractors could delay the project's completion, thus invoking the daily penalties.
Tonello said that about 85 percent of the work awarded to a general contractor is carried out by subcontractors, some of whom will make $5-$15 more per hour on projects in Massachusetts. Lately, a subcontractor bidding process that might normally take less than three weeks has been taking more than twice as long, he said. In some cases, the company doesn't receive any bids initially, and it then has to call subcontractors repeatedly and cajole them into submitting a bid or extend the search area farther out, Tonello said.
"We're not getting bids by our deadlines, pretty consistently," he said.
The price of subcontractor labor has been rising as a result of the increased demand for their work, Tonello said, but so far, low prices on commodities such as fuel and steel have made it possible for general contractors to continue bidding at roughly the same overall price.
However, that only holds true as long as commodity prices remain low, he said.
"If we see commodity prices increasing, that's going to compound the problem," Tonello said.
NO FLEXIBILITY TO RAISE PRICES, WAGES
So why don't general contractors simply raise their prices and pay everybody more? Tonello said the reason is that in Maine, developers are already paying about as much as they can afford while still allowing their hotels and other commercial projects to be viable. If the cost of construction went up significantly, they might stop building, he said.
Tonello noted that even at the current costs, certain project types such as office buildings aren't being built. He said the situation isn't likely to change unless Maine markets such as Portland begin to see an influx of new demand.
"I don't see this market changing significantly unless we see employer growth," he said.
Marks said it is worth mentioning that the labor shortage is in some ways a positive sign. It means that there is growth happening in Maine, things are being built and people are being put to work. He said it would help if more Maine schools encouraged students to pursue careers in various skilled trades, which can and do provide plenty of work at decent pay. For example, the mean annual salary in Maine as of May 2015 was $41,580 for brickmasons and blockmasons, $48,240 for electricians, and $48,780 for plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"We have to get people trained, and we have to do it fast," Marks said. "It's a good problem to have." J. Craig Anderson can be contacted at 791-6390 or at: canderson@pressherald.com Twitter: @jcraiganderson

Texto completo:   National Park Service director Jonathan B. Jarvis visits Millinocket about nat'l monument
ORONO -- The Obama administration's top park service official heard hours of passionate, conflicting views Monday on whether a proposed North Woods national monument represents an economic boon or a federal intrusion on the region's struggling economy.
During two meetings that drew well over 1,000 people, National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis saw first-hand the public divide over a proposal to protect a swath of the Katahdin region as a national monument.
Elected officials from Katahdin-area towns largely denounced the proposal over fears that a federal toehold in the North Woods would hurt Maine's forest products industry and infringe on traditional outdoor activities.
"I am asking for the people that I represent, to let this go, finally," Millinocket Councilor Michael Madore told Jarvis, reflecting a deep frustration with the latest effort to create a federal park or monument in the region.
But hundreds of national monument supporters packed a University of Maine performance hall as part of an orchestrated effort to send Jarvis back to Washington with a strong message to President Obama.
"Our motto in Maine is, 'Maine, the way life should be.' If you drive through Millinocket or Sherman right now, that is not the way life should be," said Anne Rush, a native of Sherman. "So I believe we should accept this wonderful gift ... with open arms."
The Obama administration is currently considering a plan from entrepreneur and conservationist Roxanne Quimby to donate 87,500 acres to the federal government. Quimby's nonprofit, Elliotsville Plantation Inc., also has offered to set up a $40 million endowment to finance the monument.
Jarvis' visit to Maine - at the invitation of U.S. Sen. Angus King, an independent - is a likely sign of the weight Obama is giving the controversial proposal. Unlike national parks, which can only be created by an act of Congress, presidents can create national monuments unilaterally.
Speaking to local elected leaders less than 2 miles from one of the region's shuttered paper mills, Jarvis made it clear that no decision has been made. But Jarvis added that Maine's North Woods "are absolutely worthy of being part of the National Park Service" system.
Jarvis predicted the National Park Service brand would inevitably bring some level of economic growth to the region. But he also sought to assure community leaders they would have significant input on any monument.
"You've kind of got it all up here," Jarvis said. "You've got fishing. You've got hunting. You've got snowmobiling. You've got mountain climbing. You've got biking. You've got ATVs. You've got fly-fishing. In many ways, it is an incredible place ... and there would be a large cohort of our traveling public who would like to experience this."
IMPACT ON INDUSTRY, RECREATION
In both East Millinocket and Orono, Jarvis tried to address concerns about how a national monument would affect the region's wood products industry, future industrial development and the types of recreational activities that would be allowed on the land.
Jarvis assured attendees that timber harvesting still happens in areas abutting and surrounding many national parks or monuments. He said a monument designation would not trigger tighter air-quality standards. And he stressed that the park service does not have eminent domain capabilities, a concern raised by many speakers.
Yet tempers flared briefly as the first 2 1/2-hour meeting drew to a close when members of the public accused King and Jarvis of having their minds made up already. Several hours later, UMaine's Collins Center for the Arts was filled with national monument supporters - many bussed in by environmental groups from southern Maine communities - wearing "National Monument - Yes!" T-shirts.
Michael Carpenter, who helps operate the horse-drawn carriage ride concession at Acadia National Park, said his experience since 2009 is that national parks are almost recession-proof. And one of the most common questions he gets on those carriage rides from Acadia visitors is when will they see a moose or a bear, two species not often seen on Mount Desert Island but plentiful in the North Woods.
"The economic benefits to northern Maine, northern and eastern Maine ... would be nothing short of phenomenal," Carpenter said. "The northern part of the state needs it."
Quimby, who is a co-founder of the Burt's Bees product line, had originally hoped to create a national park on her land, but has pivoted toward a national monument after it was clear that Maine's congressional delegation was not united on the issue. Quimby's son, Lucas St. Clair, has taken over the task of building support in Maine and Washington, D.C., for the national monument.
Seeking to address concerns raised by critics, St. Clair promised to ensure that some of the monument land would be open for hunting and snowmobiling.
"Outdoor recreation is part of the heritage and the culture of our state. And we've made sure that the activities that we all care about will be permanently protected," St. Clair said. "With the creation of this monument, snowmobile trails east of the East Branch will be guaranteed forever, along with hunting on those lands where it's currently allowed."
But many of the local elected officials appear unconvinced, and criticized both Quimby and the Obama administration for considering a proposal they fear will hurt the traditional economy of the region.
"A working forest is what Mainers want," said East Millinocket Selectman Mark Marston. "Don't give up Mainers. No park for Maine."
The issue has divided the forest products industry, although the major forest industry organizations oppose the monument.
"We need to do everything we can to make the Maine woods an engine of prosperity again, and that is why I strongly support the Maine Woods national monument," said Roger Milliken Jr., whose family business, Baskahegan Co., manages several hundred thousand acres in eastern Maine.
But James Robbins of Robbins Lumber Co. in Searsmont raised concerns about forest fire risks - especially in the event of a spruce budworm outbreak - on neighboring private lands because the park service often prefers to let fires burn out. He also noted that residents of East Millinocket, Medway and Patten have voted against a national park or monument.
"Everyone here knows that this national monument movement is really a back-door attempt to try to get a national park. Is the decision going to be based on the number of people bused in by environmental groups, or is it going to be based on the facts?"
RECOMMENDATION by parks chief
For his part, King acknowledged that his position on the issue has shifted from dead-set opposed when he was governor 15 years ago to "listening" because of what has happened to the region's economy over that time. The proposal also has changed dramatically from a much larger national park to a 87,500-acre national monument with a $40 million endowment.
"I'm not prepared to say 'hell no' to anything that has some economic possibility," King said. "I don't see this as a panacea that is going to solve all of our problems."
Among Maine's other congressional delegation members, U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District, opposes the proposal while U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, supports it. Republican Sen. Susan Collins has expressed strong concerns about the proposal but has not taken a firm stance against it.
After the three-hour Orono meeting, Jarvis said that he would read through any written comments and weigh Monday's six hours of discussion before making a recommendation to Obama. The president is considering numerous proposals during his final year in office, but Jarvis said the North Woods monument "is absolutely being taken very seriously."
Jarvis said he also hoped his answers to audience questions addressed misconceptions, most notably that the 87,500-acre donation would be the first step toward a much larger national park.
"This is a unique proposal, a stand-alone proposal of a gift of land with a defined boundary. And there is nothing beyond that," Jarvis said. "In our view from the National Park Service, if this happens, that's enough to really generate the kind of economic contribution to a diversified economy that could help out in this region."

Texto completo:   Weeks after most New Englanders put the shovels, boots, and salt away, snow made a reappearance on Monday.
Cold air from Canada descended into New England and dumped snow onto Northern Maine and parts of Vermont at a time when most people expect to see sunshine and flowers.
Snow began to fall around midnight and dropped up to 7.5 inches Monday morning in Aroostook County, Maine, near the Canadian border, according to the National Weather Service.
"This is amazing," the NWS station in Caribou, Maine, wrote on Twitter. The town of Perham was the winner, receiving 71/2 inches, the weather service said.
Massachusetts was spared most of the late snow, but still saw some flurries in the western part of the state.
Rich Norton, a meteorologist at the station in Caribou, said the snowy system moved north into Canada.
"There's still a bit of snow south of us, but it's cleared out of northeast Aroostook County," he said. "The intensity of the snowfall is diminishing."
Monday morning's snowfall shattered a 1941 record for snow so late in May at the Caribou station, Norton said.
The snow was also two days shy of the latest snow on record, NWS Caribou posted on Twitter.
Counties in northern Vermont received up to 21/2 inches over the weekend, according to the weather service.
Less than an inch of snow was predicted for parts of New Hampshire and southern Maine, according to the weather service.

Texto completo:   Group says transparency lacking in Good News Club at public schools
SKOWHEGAN -- An organization aimed at promoting the separation of church and state says it is concerned about a lack of transparency surrounding a Christian afterschool club at a town elementary school and has scheduled a discussion for parents this week.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation wants "to let parents know what they're doing at the Good News Club so that they can make an informed decision," said FFRF Maine Chapter President Tom Waddell. The discussion is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Margaret Chase Smith Elementary School library and is open to the public.
The Good News Club, which is in 67 schools around the state, is run by the Child Evangelism Fellowship, an organization whose goal is to "evangelize boys and girls with the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and to establish (disciple) them in the Word of God and in a local church for Christian living," according to the group's website.
It has been in place in Skowhegan-based School Administrative District 54 "for a number of years," according to district Superintendent Brent Colbry. The club meets at the Bloomfield Elementary School, though in the past it has met in other SAD 54 elementary schools. The district serves students in Canaan, Cornville, Mercer, Norridgewock, Skowhegan and Smithfield.
In October 2014, some parents complained about fliers that were being sent home with students promoting the Good News Club and FFRF has since been working towards holding a community discussion, Waddell said.
Colbry said the district gets "a couple, maybe three" complaints about the club and its fliers being distributed each year. "The only thing recent is there's another group (FFRF) that objects to it that approached us about holding a discussion for parents," Colbry said.
The district does not distribute business fliers or advertisements, but does allow promotional material for nonprofit groups or recreation programs that meet at the school to distribute materials to students after the materials are reviewed by school officials.
According to a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of Good News Club vs. Milford Central School District, schools may not discriminate against religious groups, which are allowed to have the same access to school property that other outside groups get.
While the Good News Club has a legal right to meet at public schools, Waddell said the group is not being transparent about what goes on at club meetings and that the district could benefit from policies requiring it to be more open.
"Kids read the invitation, which basically says, 'Come have some fun with your friends and learn a little about the Bible,' so they say 'yes,' but when they get home, they say things to their parents like, 'We're all going to hell because we're worshiping the wrong god,' and the parents say, 'Where did you hear that?'" Waddell said.
He said the district should update its policies around flier distribution and facility use as well as better enforce anti-bullying and anti-discrimination policies as they relate to religion.
Brad Walker, local director of the Central Maine chapter of the Child Evangelism Fellowship of Maine, said he believes the group is transparent. The brochure about the club that gets sent home to students "specifically references our belief in Jesus and the Bible, and says we will be teaching Biblical principles," Walker said.
He also said that while the club is open to all students in SAD 54, signed parental permission is required for student participation.
"I feel the brochure states what we are doing," he said. "It tells what the Good News Club is, what will be taught, who sponsors it, where the club is held, so after reading the brochure I feel parents would know we are a Bible club and that we have a Christian view."
Walker said Monday that he was not aware of the discussion planned for Wednesday. Waddell also said that his group had not specifically invited anyone from the Good News Club to Wednesday's discussion.
"I don't know if they would be qualified to speak about what actually happens at a Good News Club or not," Walker said. "I don't know if someone (from FFRF) has had an experience with Good News Club or not."

Maine Guard to lose 120 positions

Texto completo:   The impact of a 4.3 percent cut in National Guard troops at the federal level means Maine will lose approximately 120 positions over the next three years, although no soldiers will be laid off.
Maine National Guard spokesman Sgt. 1st Class Peter Morrison confirmed Monday that the reduction in troops will take place through attrition, with some of those happening already.
For the current fiscal year, 40 positions will be eliminated, followed by 76 positions the following year and three in 2018. Only 20 of those positions are full-time.
Maine currently has roughly 2,400 Army Guard members, 500 of them full-time employees.
Brig. Gen. Doug Farnham, who was appointed by Gov. Paul LePage in December to lead the Maine National Guard, spoke about the reduction at an event last Friday. Farnham was not available for comment on Monday, but provided a statement.
"The Maine Army National Guard share of these cuts is approximately 120 positions over three years. No Maine Guardsmen will lose their position in a unit as we will manage any losses through attrition," Farnham said. "It is hard to give the exact units that will be affected as the Army National Guard Force Management personnel are working very hard to support the modernization of our forces.
"We have a great working relationship with all involved, and seek to modernize equipment and capabilities throughout our units. Regardless of the units or their slight reductions, none of the authorizations we lose will create a job loss."
According to a press release last November from the Army National Guard, the reduction in overall troops is expected to happen gradually through September 2017, from 350,200 soldiers down to 335,000.
"This is an overall Army effort to match our force structure to the resources available," Army Lt. Gen. Timothy J. Kadavy, director of the Army Guard, said in a statement. "Our goal is to achieve these planned reductions through normal attrition rates as Soldiers depart from the Army Guard."
As part of that, several units will be inactivated over the next two years, Kadavy said.
Although none of those units are from Maine, "this level of force structure change will mean turbulence to all 54 states, territories and the District of Columbia," he said.
"When completed we will be a smaller Army and Army National Guard, so there will be risk in the speed and size of a response we can provide to governors in emergencies," Kadavy said. "But we believe we have taken the right approach to ensuring the (Army Guard) can be ready for both our national and state missions."
Last year, Maine faced the possibility of losing the 133rd Engineer Battalion after then-Brig. Gen. James Campbell attempted to initiate a swap of Maine's engineers with an infantry unit from another state. That plan, which had already been initiated, fell through after it was revealed Campbell misled the public and LePage about his intentions regarding the 133rd.
LePage eventually fired Campbell and appointed Gen. Gerard Bolduc as the interim leader of the guard. Bolduc was then named by LePage to replace Campbell permanently but later withdrew his name for personal reasons. LePage then nominated Farnham, who had been a high-ranking leader of the Maine Air National Guard, based in Bangor.
Shortly before Bolduc removed his name from consideration for the permanent post, it was announced that Maine would not lose the 133rd battalion after all.
Farnham pointed out Monday that force structure is "never static," and fluctuates annually depending on needs at the federal level.

"It tells what the Good News Club is, what will be taught, who sponsors it, where the club is held, so after reading the brochure I feel parents would know we are a Bible club and that we have a Christian view."
Walker said Monday that he was not aware of the discussion planned for Wednesday. Waddell also said that his group had not specifically invited anyone from the Good News Club to Wednesday's discussion.
"I don't know if they would be qualified to speak about what actually happens at a Good News Club or not," Walker said. "I don't know if someone (from FFRF) has had an experience with Good News Club or not."

Texto completo:   Commercial contractors in southern Maine say they are having trouble hiring experienced construction workers because many have fled for better-paying jobs outside the state.
Their departure, prompted in part by years of relatively little new construction in Maine, has made it harder to revive the industry now that more private and public interests are building projects again. The labor shortage also has suppressed competitive bidding in Maine and caused the delay of several projects.
Matthew Marks, CEO of the Associated General Contractors of Maine, a trade organization that represents 180 member companies, said the problem began two recessions ago in 2000, when construction in Maine reached a peak, followed by a sharp decline.
"We lost a ton of talent -- 10,000 people out the door," Marks said. "Those are the people that would have been training the modern workforce. They left."
The problem worsened during the Great Recession that began in December 2007 and prompted many Maine contractors to downsize, consolidate with other firms or shut down completely, he said. Thousands of workers lost their jobs or were unable to find enough work to sustain their households in Maine.
According to Maine Department of Labor data, there were 5,171 specialty contractors in the state at the end of 2001. There were 3,389 by the end of 2015, a 34 percent decline.
At the time of the recent recession, commercial construction workers in Maine were making an average of about $45,000 a year, Marks said, so the exodus was driven by a lack of work, and not by low pay.
"I know people that have told us we lost a good portion of our people to the Boston market," Marks said. "People have to feed their family at the end of the day. They have to keep a roof over their head."
Now that southern Maine is experiencing a resurgence of private-sector construction -- including new hotels, condominiums and senior housing -- it may be nearly impossible to lure back those skilled workers.
One reason is the significant difference in pay.
As of May 2015, the mean hourly wage for construction laborers in Maine was $14.53, or $30,230 a year, the lowest in New England and 42 percent lower than the mean hourly wage of $25.06, or $52,120 a year, in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Another issue is the reluctance of Maine construction companies to hire more full-time staff, even though the industry is recovering, Marks said.
"There is a sentiment out there of, 'What will happen if there's another downturn in the future? How many people should we bring on?'" he said. "Nobody likes to lay people off."
The problem is occurring nationally as well. Construction employment totaled 6,670,000 workers in April, the highest level since December 2008, but still isn't sufficient to meet demand, said Ken Simonson, chief economist for Associated General Contractors of America. Although the association is seeing more construction spending, there is also a worsening worker shortage, which prompted the association to launch a new online job portal this month.
"Reports from contractors and recent Census Bureau data on construction spending through March suggest industry demand for workers will remain robust, if firms can find employees with the right skills," Simonson said in a release.
One consequence of the subcontractor shortage is that construction clients are receiving fewer competitive bids and are likely paying more as a result.
In April, the deadline passed for competitive bids on the $100.2 million Sanford High School and Regional Technical Center, considered the most expensive project of its type in Maine's history.
Seven general contractors pre-qualified to bid on the project. The district received only two bids, and it ultimately awarded the master contract to an out-of-state firm, New Hampshire-based Hutter Construction.
A Maine company, Gorham-based Shaw Brothers Construction, won a $14.1 million contract to perform all of the pre-construction preparatory work on the 127-acre project site.
District Superintendent David Theoharides said he has been told that one reason more companies didn't bid is a state requirement that the winning contractor pay a $12,000 penalty for every day the project goes past its Aug. 1, 2018, completion deadline. There was a concern that difficulty finding subcontractors could lead to delays and missing the deadline.
The district also received a paucity of bids on other components of the project. For instance, it received only a single bid for drywall installation, Theoharides said.
"I think the subcontractor on the drywall knew they were the only one, because boy did they come in high (with their bid)," he said.
Consigli Construction Co. in Portland is one of the general contractors that was pre-qualified to bid on the Sanford school and ultimately decided against it.
Matt Tonello, project executive and operations manager at the firm's Portland office, said one reason was a concern that the lack of competitive bidding by subcontractors could delay the project's completion, thus invoking the daily penalties.
Tonello said that about 85 percent of the work awarded to a general contractor is carried out by subcontractors, some of whom will make $5-$15 more per hour on projects in Massachusetts. Lately, a subcontractor bidding process that might normally take less than three weeks has been taking more than twice as long, he said.
In some cases, the company doesn't receive any bids initially, and it then has to call subcontractors repeatedly and cajole them into submitting a bid or extend the search area further out, Tonello said.
"We're not getting bids by our deadlines, pretty consistently," he said.
The price of subcontractor labor has been rising as a result of the increased demand for their work, Tonello said, but so far, low prices on commodities such as fuel and steel have made it possible for general contractors to continue bidding at roughly the same overall price.
However, that only holds true as long as commodity prices remain low, he said.
"If we see commodity prices increasing, that's going to compound the problem," Tonello said.
So why don't general contractors simply raise their prices and pay everybody more? Tonello said the reason is that in Maine, developers are already paying about as much as they can afford while still allowing their hotels and other commercial projects to be viable. If the cost of construction went up significantly, they might stop building, he said.
Tonello noted that even at the current costs, certain project types such as office buildings aren't being built. He said the situation isn't likely to change unless Maine markets such as Portland begin to see an influx of new demand.
"I don't see this market changing significantly unless we see employer growth," he said.
Marks said it is worth mentioning that the labor shortage is in some ways a positive sign. It means that there is growth happening in Maine, things are being built and people are being put to work. He said it would help if more Maine schools would encourage students to pursue careers in various skilled trades, which can and do provide plenty of work at a decent pay. For example the mean annual salary in Maine as of May 2015 was $41,580 for brickmasons and blockmasons, $48,240 for electricians, and $48,780 for plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"We have to get people trained, and we have to do it fast," Marks said. "It's a good problem to have."

Texto completo:   A forum on opiate use will be held at Pittston Consolidated School at 6 pm Monday night.
Pittston gathering focuses on traffickers from away
PITTSTON -- For more than an hour Monday evening, a crowd of about 35 heard from three speakers who are dealing in one way or another with an issue that's become all too familiar around the state: opiate addiction.
The speakers were Kennebec County Sheriff Ryan Reardon, clinical psychologist Frederick White and substance abuse prevention coordinator Holly Kiidli.
But while all three agreed that stemming the tide of addiction will require considerably more treatment opportunities than are now available to opiate users in Maine, when it came time for those in the audience to speak, the few who did were mostly concerned with the law enforcement piece of the equation.
One woman voiced her frustration about a man from New York she had read about in the newspaper who was charged with aggravated drug trafficking and was made to pay a $400 fine.
The punishment seemed too light for the crime, she argued.
Her frustration was echoed by Pittston Selectman Greg Lumbert, who is also a deputy with the Hancock County Sheriff's Office and a constable for the town of Randolph.
Lumbert organized the Tuesday night forum, which followed others that have been held across the state and county. Earlier this year, he ran for the selectboard in part to draw more awareness to the issue of drugs and addiction.
"I feel there's a big need for the recognition of how to control this problem. We're not going to defeat this by laying down. To defeat this you've got to keep fighting, no matter how hard it gets. You've got to keep fighting," Lumbert said.
To that end, Lumbert said, he testified before state lawmakers this session for a bill that created tougher penalties for individuals crossing into Maine with the intent to distribute drugs. The bill ultimately passed.
"I've been in law enforcement since 1983. This stuff isn't new to me," Lumbert said. "Let's face it: Opiates aren't growing in Maine. They're like bananas. That's the example I gave. How do bananas get here? Until you stop those bananas coming, you're going to have a problem."
Everyone from lawyers to police officers to psychologists agree that preventing further drug overdoses will require more than just arrests.
It's become a common point of emphasis by Reardon and others in the law enforcement community.
As Reardon pointed out Monday, the Augusta Police Department has done a "soft launch" of a program that matches willing drug users with recovery coaches and directs them to treatment opportunities.
Reardon said the sheriff's office is now working to start its own "angel program," as such approaches are known.
Indeed, the demand for heroin and other drugs in Maine is clear and catastrophic.
Statewide, drug overdose deaths increased by 31 percent in 2015, reaching a new high of 272 fatalities that was fueled by a near doubling of heroin deaths, according to data released earlier this year by the attorney general's office. There were 107 deaths from heroin compared to 57 heroin overdoses the previous year.
In 2015, Kennebec County had 33 overdose deaths, up 65 percent from 20 in 2014.
But while few dispute the need to get drug users into treatment, the Monday night forum in Pittston was a reminder that plenty are still frustrated about who is bringing the drugs here in the first place.

Texto completo:   The impact of a 4.3 percent cut in National Guard troops at the federal level means Maine will lose approximately 120 positions over the next three years, although no soldiers will be laid off.
Maine National Guard spokesman Sgt. 1st Class Peter Morrison confirmed Monday that the reduction in troops will take place through attrition, with some of those happening already.
For the current fiscal year, 40 positions will be eliminated, followed by 76 positions the following year and three in 2018. Only 20 of those positions are full-time.
Maine currently has roughly 2,400 Army Guard members, 500 of them full-time employees.
Brig. Gen. Doug Farnham, who was appointed by Gov. Paul LePage in December to lead the Maine National Guard, spoke about the reduction at an event last Friday. Farnham was not available for comment on Monday, but provided a statement.
"The Maine Army National Guard share of these cuts is approximately 120 positions over three years. No Maine Guardsmen will lose their position in a unit as we will manage any losses through attrition," Farnham said. "It is hard to give the exact units that will be affected as the Army National Guard Force Management personnel are working very hard to support the modernization of our forces.
"We have a great working relationship with all involved, and seek to modernize equipment and capabilities throughout our units. Regardless of the units or their slight reductions, none of the authorizations we lose will create a job loss."
According to a press release last November from the Army National Guard, the reduction in overall troops is expected to happen gradually through September 2017, from 350,200 soldiers down to 335,000.
"This is an overall Army effort to match our force structure to the resources available," Army Lt. Gen. Timothy J. Kadavy, director of the Army Guard, said in a statement. "Our goal is to achieve these planned reductions through normal attrition rates as Soldiers depart from the Army Guard."
As part of that, several units will be inactivated over the next two years, Kadavy said.
Although none of those units are from Maine, "this level of force structure change will mean turbulence to all 54 states, territories and the District of Columbia," he said.
"When completed we will be a smaller Army and Army National Guard, so there will be risk in the speed and size of a response we can provide to governors in emergencies," Kadavy said. "But we believe we have taken the right approach to ensuring the (Army Guard) can be ready for both our national and state missions."
Last year, Maine faced the possibility of losing the 133rd Engineer Battalion after then-Brig. Gen. James Campbell attempted to initiate a swap of Maine's engineers with an infantry unit from another state. That plan, which had already been initiated, fell through after it was revealed Campbell misled the public and LePage about his intentions regarding the 133rd.
LePage eventually fired Campbell and appointed Gen. Gerard Bolduc as the interim leader of the guard. Bolduc was then named by LePage to replace Campbell permanently but later withdrew his name for personal reasons. LePage then nominated Farnham, who had been a high-ranking leader of the Maine Air National Guard, based in Bangor.
Shortly before Bolduc removed his name from consideration for the permanent post, it was announced that Maine would not lose the 133rd battalion after all.
Farnham pointed out Monday that force structure is "never static," and fluctuates annually depending on needs at the federal level.

Texto completo:   Summit focuses on drug-impaired drivers as state considers legalizing pot
Prosecutors, police officers and traffic safety experts say more education about the danger of drug-impaired driving is needed as Maine, which is dealing with a heroin epidemic, considers legalizing marijuana for recreational use.
The issue of drug-impaired driving was the focus of a summit in Portland on Monday that brought together people in law enforcement to look at new research and approaches to dealing with drivers who are under the influence.
While alcohol is still the primary intoxicant for people behind the wheel, more people are also using marijuana, prescription drugs and heroin while driving, said experts who spoke at the summit hosted by AAA Northern New England and the Maine Bureau of Highway Safety.
"Back in the early '80s, we were in the same crisis with OUI alcohol as we are today with OUI drugs," said Col. Robert Williams, chief of the Maine State Police. "We have no idea how big the problem is."
The summit came less than a week after AAA released a new study that finds blood tests are useless for detecting incidents of drivers operating under the influence while using pot, and as Maine voters consider whether to legalize recreational marijuana. It also comes at a time when police are dealing with a surge in heroin use -- last year there were 272 fatal drug overdoses in the state -- and as aging Maine residents are using more prescription drugs that could impair their ability to safely drive, experts say. Last year, 70 million pills were prescribed in Maine.
Williams said Maine needs to be better prepared to deal with the prospect of legalized recreational marijuana as Mainers face a vote on the issue in November. Maine, which has allowed medical marijuana since 1999, could join Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia in allowing adult use of marijuana. Williams believes the number of arrests for operating under the influence will spike if Maine legalizes marijuana.
"In other states that have (legal marijuana), they'll tell you, as prepared as they thought they were, they were so unprepared they can't count the ways," Williams said.
Fatal crashes involving drivers who recently used marijuana doubled in Washington after that state legalized the drug, according to AAA. In 2013, nearly 13 percent of weekend nighttime drivers had evidence of marijuana in their systems, up from 9 percent in 2007.
Police currently use a roadside drug recognition exam to detect impairment from drugs, but experts say more resources and better tools are needed to stop drugged driving, as the culture becomes more accepting of marijuana use. There are about 90 drug recognition experts across the state and more are needed to deal with the number of impaired drivers, law enforcement officials said at the summit.
Jake Nelson, director of traffic safety, advocacy and research for AAA, said drug-impaired driving is a complex issue because of a lack of solid information about the extent of the problem, both in Maine and across the country.
"We're painting the plane as we fly it when it comes to drug-impaired driving," he said.
AAA is advocating for laws that allow permissible inference of marijuana impairment -- or the assumption that someone is impaired if he or she shows signs of it -- rather than laws that set a chemical limit for the amount of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, in a person's blood while driving. Experts say it is difficult to set legal limits for the concentration of THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, in the blood because THC affects everyone differently and is detectable in tests long after a person stops being impaired.
The Maine Legislature considered a bill to set a 5-nanogram limit in drivers' blood, but it was rejected by the House last month. Currently, six states -- Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington -- have set specific limits for THC, the Associated Press reported.
Nelson said drivers operating vehicles while using legally obtained prescription drugs is another issue law enforcement needs to tackle, especially in states like Maine with aging populations. Eight out of 10 drivers over the age of 65 take medication on a regular basis and 69 percent take a drug known to impair driving, he said.
"This is a huge problem and one people aren't talking about because nobody knows what to do about it," he said.
Marianne Lynch, assistant district attorney for Penobscot County, and Detective Sgt. Andrew Whitehouse of the Penobscot County Sheriff's Office, say more education about impaired driving is needed as Maine considers legalizing marijuana and as the county deals with heroin and methamphetamine problems. Lynch said some drivers believe they are unaffected and fine to drive when their ability to safely drive is actually diminished.
Whitehouse said he is also concerned about the amount of prescription drugs being taken by drivers because they aren't being advised about waiting to see how they are affected by a new medication. He said events like Monday's summit are helpful for police to develop strategies to deal with these concerns.
"Anytime we get together with prosecutors and other police officers and talk about how to deal with this, it's a win-win for us," Whitehouse said.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture has awarded the Maine Forest Service a $380,000 grant to develop programs to help a forest product industry hit by a sharp decline in demand for softwood species.
The USDA grant announced Monday will allow the Maine Forest Service to establish a Wood Energy Assistance Team focused on biomass heating and another program. Called the "Strengthening and Expanding Maine Wood Markets" project, it will create a new job for someone at the forest service to specialize in forest product markets issues.
"At a time of severe challenges for the pulp and paper industry, we must work across all levels of government to leverage resources and build opportunities for the entire forest products sector," U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King said in a joint statement announcing the award Monday.
The funds are part of an $8.5 million allocation from the USDA to expand and accelerate wood-related technologies for commercial construction, power generation and other wood product innovations.
The grant comes as pricing declined for softwood species used by shuttered mills, including Verso's Bucksport mill, Great Northern Paper's East Millinocket mill and the Madison mill, which closed this month.
Eric Kingsley, a consultant who writes a blog for the pricing information company Forest2Market, wrote this month that Madison's closure added to a reduction of about 2.1 million tons in the demand for softwood pulp in Maine since early 2014.
"To put this volume in perspective, 2.1 million tons equates to 192 truckloads of wood running 365 days per year -- and that only represents the volume lost in the softwood markets," Kingsley wrote.
With that drop in demand, Kingsley said prices have started to decline through the first quarter of 2016, by about 9 percent from one year ago, which he wrote has hit landowners in the Penobscot River Valley.
The drop in price has created some interest in others to find new uses for softwood species, he wrote, including wood pellet and biofuel manufacturing and wood chip exports.

Texto completo:   CARIBOU, Maine -- There's something new brewing in Aroostook County. The opening of the first craft brewery in Caribou is on tap, and the beer is scheduled to pour in mid-June.
Northern Maine Brewing Co. will be the only craft brewery in The County, and with planned beers including the stout "Skidder Grease" and the lighter IPA "Northern Maine Light," those behind the venture say the goal is to keep the flavors, ambiance and ingredients as local as possible.
"Is Aroostook County ready for a craft beer pub?" brewery co-investor and spokesman Joe Sleeper said. "Absolutely."
Carpenters, painters, plumbers and electricians were hard at work on the building located across from the Caribou Inn and Convention Center earlier this month, putting the finishing touches on the bar and restaurant areas.
In the kitchen, newly hired executive chef Joseph Gervais was tiling and grouting the floor.
Gervais and Sleeper are looking forward to introducing area residents to small-batch beers.
"People's take on craft beer is that they are really strong and dark or really 'hoppy' tasting," Gervais said. "But really, what we are doing is brewing small batches using local ingredients to make a great tasting beer."
Sleeper said using those local ingredients will create a uniquely northern Maine brew selection.
"Most of the components for the beer we will brew here are grown within one hour of Northern Maine Brewing Co.," he said. "We are truly committed to the local portion of this project."
In addition, all of the table tops, the bar top and doors were crafted by members of the Amish community in Easton, Sleeper said.
What is not local is the high-tech brewery equipment itself -- a first of its kind in this country designed and made by Fleck's Brauhaus Technik of Austria.
"It's a very compact brewhouse," according to Vincent Fleck, founder and director of the company.
The brewery can make two 3.5 barrel batches of beer per day, Fleck said. Several of the first trial batches at Northern Maine Brewing Co. included a red ale and a light lager.
Fleck was in Caribou in March to direct the installation of the brewery and was back in early May to assist in fine tuning the fermentation and brew tanks. Thanks to the Internet, Fleck will remain connected to Northern Maine Brewing Co. to help troubleshoot any issues. The system is completely automated, Fleck said, which frees the brewers up to research and develop new beers.
According to market sales, northern Mainers are thirsty for new beers.
"People in The County drink a lot of beer," Rick Cyr of Maine Distributors said. "There are 69,000 people living in Aroostook, and last year I [distributed] 700,000 cases of beer here."
Maine Distributer gets craft beers from around the state into the retail market, and according to Cyr there are more than 70 different craft breweries in the state.
Gervais said his restaurant will seat 85, and he has begun the hiring process for the 15 to 20 employees he will need to staff it and the bar.
"The biggest thing people are going to notice about a craft beer bar is that they will be getting a very drinkable beer that they can savor and pair with their food," Gervais said. "It is a different dining and drinking experience."
Fleck said Aroostook County has everything it needs to produce a high-quality beer.
"You must have good malts, good hops, good water and good, clean equipment," he said. "You have all those things here."
The best brewers, he said, learn by doing with trial and error. He said Sleeper, Gervais and their crew are well on their way to a quality beer.
"They started in March and now we are seeing some of the results," Fleck said. "They are fine tuning, but it looks very good."
His company has built breweries in 35 countries, and the one starting up at Northern Maine Brewing Co. is his 155th and first in the U.S. On the restaurant side of things, Gervais promises a menu as unique and as locally sourced as the beers.
"We are going to buy as much as we can from local vendors to offer a mixture of pub food and entrees inspired by locally grown and produced ingredients," he said. "We really want that local feel to carry through."

Resumen: After a tense forum involving Katahdin region leaders in East Millinocket earlier in the day, where speakers were almost universally opposed to the proposal, the public meeting at UMaine's Collins Center for the Arts showed the stark differences of opinion on the subject held by people around the state. Parker Lumber Co. co-owner Brian Parker said that a national park would have a negative impact on an industry that produces $7.5 billion in revenue for the state annually, and would hurt his mill, which draws wood from the forests within a 150-mile radius of the Quimby lands.

Texto completo:   ORONO, Maine -- A near capacity crowd of 1,400 people attended a forum on a proposed North Woods national monument on Monday at the University of Maine during which pro and con arguments followed one another in quick succession.
After a tense forum involving Katahdin region leaders in East Millinocket earlier in the day, where speakers were almost universally opposed to the proposal, the public meeting at UMaine's Collins Center for the Arts showed the stark differences of opinion on the subject held by people around the state.
Fans of the monument proposed by the family of entrepreneur Roxanne Quimby, some of whom rode buses from Portland sponsored by environmentalist groups, praised it as a tonic that would put lovely woods on an international stage, draw thousands of tourists and create more jobs in a Katahdin region that needs them. Opponents, including forest-products workers, decried it as an oversold boondoggle that would impose an unwanted and unresponsive federal control on the area.
The UMaine forum was the second attended by National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis and U.S. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. The first, at an East Millinocket higher education center, drew about 75 people.
Jarvis told the UMaine audience that many entrepreneurs have donated land to the park service, but said that Quimby's offer of a $20 million endowment and an additional $20 million in cash to be raised by her was completely unprecedented.
The park service, he said, has no interest in expanding the proposed monument land beyond its present boundaries and would not -- could not -- use eminent domain powers to seize adjoining land.
Lucas St. Clair, Quimby's son and a leading proponent of the monument, warned residents in the latter forum that a national monument "isn't a silver bullet -- no one thing is. But a major recreational attraction in the interior of northern Maine can be part of a new economic foundation that will create opportunities for new businesses to start and existing businesses to grow.
"All told, the national monument and endowment represent a $100 million investment in the Katahdin region and in the state," said St. Clair, who made remarks before the floor was opened to questions at the UMaine venue.
The questions came steadily from people who lined up at microphones on both sides of the auditorium, with speakers alternating pro and con with questions or comments.
Bangor City Council Chairman Sean Faircloth cited three national monuments across the U.S. that he said created more than 1,500 jobs. He said placing the monument designation on the 87,500-acre Quimby parcel east of Baxter State Park would create "a tremendous economic boon."
"It is printing money. It is bringing economic development, jobs and money to this region," Faircloth said.
Sportsman's Alliance of Maine wildlife biologist Gerry Lavigne said that more than 90 percent of his organization's members have opposed the monument designation proposal.
"We feel that any national park presence in Maine will result in a net reduction" of access, Levine said. "Our greatest fear is that in 20 years, we will have something that locks people out of Maine's woodlands instead of encouraging their use."
Others said that the decimation of the state's paper mills -- five closed in the last six years -- made a change in Maine's economic focus inevitable.
"There is a lot of support out there in the local communities. I feel like I am here to reiterate that here," said Mount Chase resident Lindsay Downing, who owns a lodge 16 miles from the northern end of the proposed monument space. "If a national monument or park were to come to the region, everybody would benefit from it. You would not see anybody sitting here right now if this land was not worthy of a national monument designation."
Parker Lumber Co. co-owner Brian Parker said that a national park would have a negative impact on an industry that produces $7.5 billion in revenue for the state annually, and would hurt his mill, which draws wood from the forests within a 150-mile radius of the Quimby lands.
"The wood, the raw wood, is our lifeblood. I would like everyone to know that Maine's woods are still working," Parker said. "The industry is diverse. It's a close network of families. This is the backbone of the state. We have to make sure we don't make any decision that negatively impacts that industry."
Steve Brook, spokesman for the Maine Council of Trout Unlimited, said the monument would help preserve some of the best fishing waters of the Penobscot, Seboeis and Piscataquis rivers, among others.
Maine Snowmobile Association Executive Director Bob Meyers said the monument effort represented "an admission of [the] failure" of the national park campaign that preceded it.
"Maine people know that this is not about conservation. It is about control and buying a legacy," Meyers said.
Former Millinocket Town Councilor Avern Danforth took the opposite view.
"We need the branding of a national monument. You give us that opportunity, and we will make a new beginning," Danforth said.
King told the audience at the end of the second forum that what he had just witnessed "was pretty special for the State of Maine."
"We were polite, we were respectful," said King, who has been a catalyst in the debate and set up the forums.
Earlier, at the East Millinocket event, Millinocket Town Councilor Michael Madore said that as a member of the National Park Foundation, Quimby had "a conflict of influence" over state and local leaders who have overwhelmingly opposed her proposal for eight years because she and her son have greater access to park leaders and President Barack Obama than they do.
"It is tiring, this perpetual cycle of saying no," Madore said during the 2 1/2-hour meeting at Katahdin Region Higher Education Center in East Millinocket.
Madore asked, "Why are we continuing to re-examine the same questions? Is it really for the good of Maine, or is it that Mrs. Quimby has an idea in her mind that she wants?"
"No governing body has recommended or wants this park or monument, not on any level," Madore said, later adding, "this would be in our backyard. We ask that you please let this go, finally."
Jarvis met at the education center with selectmen and town councilors from East Millinocket, Medway, Millinocket, Mount Chase, Patten, Sherman and Stacyville, who were themselves gathered in the same room for the first time in decades.
Out of the approximately 75 people there, two spoke in favor of the monument. The meeting was cordial but often tense. One man, a proposal opponent, was ejected for using an obscenity.
Patten Board of Selectmen Chairman Richard Schmidt III said that while Patten residents had voted against the proposal at an April referendum, "a good core" of local businesses supported the plan, which he said was a great opportunity.
"I believe we have the ability to channel this river in a direction that can serve us best," Schmidt said.
Another man in the audience said that he represented "a silent majority" who supported the Quimby plan.
The forum followed a breakfast with Jarvis and the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce at River Driver's restaurant just north of Millinocket.
No one can stop the president from signing an executive order turning Quimby's land into a monument, said King, who earlier this year voted against a measure that would have moderated the president's authority to designate national monuments. Obama has until Jan. 19, 2017, the very last day of his administration, to issue an executive order creating a national monument. Such monuments often become national parks later.
Obama, King said, sent Jarvis to Maine to gauge local response to the Quimby proposal and advise him. Jarvis said he appreciated the concerns residents have.
"I heard a lot of real deep honesty and I appreciate that. No one was holding back and that's good, too," Jarvis said. "I know some of you are worried in a big, big way and adamantly opposed to this."

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- The Maine Air National Guard's 101st Air Refueling Wing is in high demand, which is why the unit has more than six dozen personnel currently deployed and has its busiest schedule ever, according to the head of the state's military forces.
"Our flying hours will be the highest ever in 2016," Brig. Gen. Douglas Farnham told members of the Disabled American Veterans of Maine at the organization's convention Friday about the 101st -- known as the MAINEiacs. Farnham told the group four aircraft from the 101st are deployed to U.S. Central Command, which covers Afghanistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan and a dozen other neighboring countries.
"There are 76 [personnel] from the 101st that are working over there now, as of today," Devin Robinson, Air Guard spokesman, said Monday. "That number changes day to day."
The 101st has 875 personnel, the spokesman said. The deployments started earlier this year in small groups, said Farnham, who is adjutant general for the Maine National Guard.
"It's basically for 120 days," he said. "Some are going over for 60, some are going for 120 and some are going for 30. They get back sometime in June."
The men and women of the 101st deploy in small groups and return in small groups, which is why send-off and welcome home ceremonies are not held, said Farnham, declining to be more specific about where the Maine airmen and women are deployed.
"That is the largest group deployment to that area," said the veteran airman, who in mid-January became leader of the Maine National Guard and commissioner of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management.
Farnham also gave the DAV members an update about the Maine Army Guard, saying 100 part-time and around 20 full-time posts are being eliminated as part of the country's reduction in Army Guard members. Reductions in the Air Guard are not expected, he said.
A large number of the 101st recently went to Norway for training, Farnham said, and a total of "162 airmen spent at least part of the last year deployed."
In the 1990s there were around 550 KC-135 refuelers in the U.S. fleet with most assigned to active duty U.S. Air Force units, but now there are approximately 300 and half are with Air National Guard units, including the 101st, he said.
"The air refuelers have never been more crucial," Farnham said.

Texto completo:   ORONO, Maine -- Whenever a team has a successful season, there is usually a turning point or two.
University of Maine first-year softball coach Mike Coutts said for his newly crowned America East champion Black Bears, it was the April series against defending titlist Binghamton that defined his team.
"They had punched us in the mouth in the first game of the series 7-3 and I told the girls after the game that if you were going to be any kind of a team, you've got to punch them back," said Coutts, whose Black Bears won the second game of the doubleheader 3-0 before taking the series with a 2-1 triumph the next day.
Maine has gone 13-4 since that loss and will now face No. 16 Georgia in the Athens NCAA Regional Tournament at 3:30 p.m. Friday.
It will be Maine's third NCAA Tournament berth, but first since 2004.
"They responded. They stood their ground, which is something they hadn't done in past years," said Coutts, who had been the assistant for his wife, Lynn, the previous three years.
"[The Binghamton series] was a good reality check. We learned we can fight back, we can be resilient and overcome adversity," said catcher Janelle Bouchard of Kennebunk, the America East Player of the Year and Maine's only senior.
Junior lefty Erin Bogdanovich, the America East Pitcher of the Year and the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, felt a 6-2 regular-season win at Stony Brook after a 4-0 loss in the first game was pivotal for the Bears.
"We [decided we] weren't going to lose to them again and once we beat them, we had the mindset we could beat anyone," said Bogdanovich.
Junior shortstop Felicia Lennon said she felt the team could be special "all year long."
"The difference has been our chemistry," she said. "This is a real special group of girls. We really want to be out there together and play for each other, which has been a huge part of our success."
"I knew the minute I walked in [during fall softball] that there was something special about this team," said freshman third baseman-outfielder Alyssa Derrick, the league's Rookie of the Year. "It was how we meshed, how we worked together, how we talked and bonded."
With eight wins in their last nine games, a .320 batting average, a respectable 52 errors in 47 games and pitchers Bogdanovich (10-4, 2.87 earned run average) and sophomore Molly Flowers (11-10, 2.58), the Black Bears are expecting to be competitive in a double-elimination regional that also includes 29-24 Oklahoma State and 26-26 Northwestern University from Illinois.
Georgia is the lowest-seeded host in the 64-team tourney.
"We want to prove ourselves and we believe we can definitely do that," Lennon said.
"We're in a really good bracket. There's going to be some good competition and really good games. We're going to have fun and see what happens," said junior catcher-outfielder Rachel Harvey.

Texto completo:   EAST MILLINOCKET, Maine -- Some Katahdin region leaders told the National Park Service's top administrator Monday that a monument proposed by Roxanne Quimby's family for lands east of Baxter State Park was the vision of a millionaire who was using her money and influence to control their destiny.
Millinocket Town Councilor Michael Madore said that as a member of the National Park Foundation, Quimby had "a conflict of influence" over state and local leaders who have overwhelmingly opposed her proposal for eight years because she and her son, Lucas St. Clair, have greater access to park leaders and President Barack Obama than they do.
"It is tiring, this perpetual cycle of saying no," Madore told National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis and U.S. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, during a 2 1/2-hour meeting at Katahdin Region Higher Education Center in East Millinocket. Jarvis and King are scheduled to appear at a second public forum at the Collins Center for the Arts on the University of Maine campus in Orono at 5 p.m.
Madore asked, "Why are we continuing to re-examine the same questions? Is it really for the good of Maine, or is it that Mrs. Quimby has an idea in her mind that she wants?"
"No governing body has recommended or wants this park or monument, not on any level," Madore said, later adding, "this would be in our backyard. We ask that you please let this go, finally."
Jarvis met at the education center with selectmen and town councilors from East Millinocket, Medway, Millinocket, Mount Chase, Patten, Sherman and Stacyville, who were themselves gathered in the same room for the first time in decades.
Out of the approximately 75 people there, two spoke in favor of the monument. The meeting was cordial but often tense. One man, a proposal opponent, was ejected for using an obscenity.
Patten Board of Selectmen Chairman Richard Schmidt III said that while Patten residents had voted against the proposal at an April referendum, "a good core" of local businesses supported the plan, which he said was a great opportunity.
"I believe we have the ability to channel this river in a direction that can serve us best," Schmidt said.
Another man in the audience said that he represented "a silent majority" who supported the Quimby plan.
The forum followed a breakfast with Jarvis and the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce at River Driver's restaurant just north of Millinocket.
No one can stop the president from signing an executive order turning Quimby's land into a monument, King said. Obama has until Jan. 19, 2017, the very last day of his administration, to issue an executive order creating a national monument. Such monuments often become national parks later.
Obama, King said, sent Jarvis to Maine to gauge local response to the Quimby proposal and advise him. Jarvis said he appreciated the concerns residents have.
"I heard a lot of real deep honesty and I appreciate that. No one was holding back and that's good, too," Jarvis said. "I know some of you are worried in a big, big way and adamantly opposed to this."
Jarvis said that Quimby had no conflict because she was doing what the foundation was established to do -- raising money and donating land to the national park system. The Rockefeller family acted much the same way in establishing Acadia National Park, he said.
Jarvis said he has visited Quimby's approximately 87,500-acre parcel four times and that it fits park service criteria in terms of its suitability, feasibility and significance. However, its feasibility might be weak. Jarvis said there "is the potential" for private landowners to cut off access to Quimby's land, which he said would be "tragic," but later said that he didn't think such an occurrence was realistic.
Millinocket Town Council Chairman Richard Angotti Jr. said that the monument proposal lacked details in the same manner as the park proposal. Jarvis said the monument will likely generate $4 for its local economy for every federal dollar invested in it, but that estimate is a national average.
The park service has done no specific estimates on the economic impact of designating Quimby's land a monument, Jarvis said.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- The Maine Department of Economic and Community Development recently announced that seven towns from Lubec to Lisbon have been awarded funding under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program administered by the Office of Community Development within DECD.
Ashland was among the communities named, and will receive $150,000 to improve the facades of eight businesses in the village core area and the Rt. 163 and Rt. 11 corridor.
"These awards have a direct impact on the economic stability and sustainability of Maine's small businesses," said DECD Commissioner George Gervais. "The investments made in these communities not only benefit the individual businesses, it also helps create new career opportunities for Maine people. The grants represent the LePage Administration's commitment to becoming better partners with the private sector, leveraging new private investment to achieve greater prosperity across Maine."
The Micro-Enterprise Assistance (MEA) Grant Program provides grant funds to communities to assist in innovative solutions to problems faced by micro-enterprise businesses. Assistance to businesses may be in the form of grants or loans at the discretion of the community, including a match from the benefiting business.
Other communities awarded included Lubec, Lisbon, the Carrabassett Valley, Greenville, Sangerville and Brunswick.

Orono High athlete unleashes all-time best discus throw

Texto completo:   Jake Koffman demonstrated again Friday that he is going to be a tough man to beat in the discus this season.
The Orono High School junior unleashed a throw of 186 feet, 3 inches during a five-way meet at Old Town High School. The effort is an all-time best for a Maine high school athlete.
But it is not recognized as a state record because those standards can only be set during a state championship meet.
"You see the event and you start watching some good kids throw and you know which ones are good by how the discus flies and how long it stays in the air," said Orono head coach Chris Libby. "Then you see Jake let one go and it is just jaw-dropping to watch how far he can chuck a disc."
The all-classes state record is held by Scott Mason of Lawrence High of Fairfield, who threw 177-8 at the 1980 Class B outdoor meet. Justin Whitney of Winthrop set the Class C standard of 169-1, also in 1980.
Jared Bell of Deering holds the Class A record at 176-7, set in 2013.
Koffman's performance on Friday beat his previous personal record by nearly 10 feet and would have surpassed the all-classes mark by 8 feet, 7 inches.
The only other Maine high school competitor who has been within 26 feet of Koffman's 186-3 this spring is South Portland shot put star Daniel Guiliani Jr., who threw 169-9 1/2 last Wednesday.
Libby credited Orono throwers coach Lin White with helping develop Koffman and the team's other discus, javelin and shot put competitors.
Koffman is the two-time defending Penobscot Valley Conference Small-School champion in the discus and earned the Class C state title last June.
Libby said he envisions more good things ahead for Koffman throwing the discus. Orono coaches stress to their athletes the need to "pop" a big throw amidst the routine of consistently good efforts.
"Everything that he's doing is very normalized. He fouled another throw that was probably over 190 feet, landed in the woods, at Old Town," Libby said. "Jake has not popped a throw yet."

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- The Winslow Police Department on Monday posted a Facebook alert about the possible arrival of the Felony Lane Gang in the area.
The Felony Lane Gang is a loosely organized group of criminals from Florida who break into cars and use the victim's driver's license, debit cards, credit cards and checks to cash checks at local financial institutions, Winslow police said.
"It is believed that these folks have worked their way up to Maine," the post said. "These criminals have been termed the Felony Lane Gang, as they prefer to use the furthest drive-up teller at financial institutions in an attempt to make their identification more difficult."
According to police, the group usually targets the cars of women who park at gyms, fitness centers, parks, day care centers and similar locations in search of driver's licenses, debit cards and credit cards, which are used to cash checks that are often stolen from cars in other locations. Gang members also are known to recruit local people who resemble the victims to cash these checks.
In addition, police said, the Felony Lane Gang often uses rental cars with tinted windows and fake or stolen license plates that are removed very shortly after they cash the checks.
The women who cash these checks often wear wigs and makeup in an attempt to resemble the person whose driver's license they are using.
Residents are urged to lock their cars and to avoid leaving purses and other valuables inside.
"Do not confront these individuals and report all suspicious activity to the police," the post said. "Immediately report to the police if your license plate is stolen or your car is broken into."
The police also instructed victims to immediately report to their financial institution any theft of a driver's license, debit card, credit card or check.
Residents also were warned not to agree to cash checks for anyone they don't know personally and to contact police if asked to cash a check by a stranger.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- A local man was sentenced Monday at the Penobscot Judicial Center to five years in prison with all but nine months suspended on one count of gross sexual assault.
Casey Falvey, 21, of Bangor also was sentenced to four years of probation.He will be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.
He will be incarcerated at the Penobscot County Jail because he was ordered to serve nine months behind bars.
Falvey began serving his sentence immediately after he was sentenced. He had been free on unsecured bail, according to his attorney Hunter Tzovarras of Bangor.
Tzovarras recommended the sentence imposed. Alice Clifford, deputy district attorney for Penobscot County, said that Falvey should be sentenced to 12 years in prison with all but four years suspended, followed by six years of probation.
By pleading guilty in October, Falvey admitted that in July 2014, he had sex with a then 13-year-old girl after he gave her alcohol.
The victim, who is not being identified by the Bangor Daily News, did not appear in court Monday. Her father told Superior Court Justice Ann Murray that he and his daughter had moved to northern Penobscot County because of the assault and that she has been in counseling.
"He preyed upon my daughter," said the victim's father, who is not being identified to protect her identity. "She has been in her own little prison for two years. Six months in jail is not enough."
Falvey's family said that he began turning his life around after he was indicted in September 2014 by the Penobscot County grand jury. He voluntarily entered a faith-based rehabilitation program and has been working with his father, who owns a landscaping business.
"He's shown commitment to his new life," Michael Falvey of Bangor, who raised his children as a single father, told the judge. "His mother left when he was in diapers. It's been difficult for him."
Casey Falvey apologized to his victim.
"I'm ready to accept whatever sentence you give," he said.
In imposing the sentence, Murray said that she found the impact on the victim "quite significant." The judge also said the mitigating factors in the case included: Falvey's guilty plea; his remorse for the crime; and her conclusion that his substance abuse issues and immaturity contributed to the sexual assault.
"I'm favorably impressed that he's been clean and sober for a period of time and made changes in his lifestyle for the better," Murray said.
Falvey faced up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.

Texto completo:   A year after two Connecticut programs were part of the NCAA Division I softball field for the first time, no state schools were selected to play in the 2016 tournament.
However, that doesn't mean that the state won't be well represented in the journey to crowning a national champion in Oklahoma City on either June 7 or 8.
Nine Connecticut players from five teams are part of the field of 64 which was announced on Sunday night.
Maine leads the way with four players as Erika Leonard of Rocky Hill, Southington's Rachel Harvey and Brookfield's Felicia Lennon hit first, fourth and fifth during Maine's run to the America East tournament title while former Sacred Heart Academy star Molly Flowers of East Haven leads the Black Bears with 11 victories and 142 strikeouts.
Ironically, Maine's NCAA opener is against No. 16 seed and host Georgia, a team featuring Oxford native and former Masuk High star Rachele Fico on the coaching staff.
Another star out of Masuk, Tatum Buckley was third on the Florida Atlantic team with 34 RBIs with three coming in the first two games in the run to the Conference USA tournament title. The Owls, coached by Connecticut-born softball legend Joan Joyce, was sent to the regional being hosted by No. 1 overall seed Florida and will play Central Florida on Friday.
Former Torrington High star Sydney Matzko won two games as a freshman for a North Carolina team which will play Longwood in the regional hosted by No. 7 seed James Madison.
Guilford's Astin Donovan and Amber Donovan, sisters out of Mercy High School, helped South Florida earn an at-large bid into the field of 64.
Astin Donovan is third on the USF team with 51 hits and 11 stolen bases as the Bulls will play South Carolina in the first game of the regional hosted by Florida State.
Finally, New Britain's Lena Springer who is the sister of Houston Astros and former UConn outfielder George Springer, won five games for NCAA-bound Ohio State. The Buckeyes' first opponent in the Tennessee regional is eight-time national champion Arizona.
There are also nine Connecticut players alive in the Division II and III tournaments.
Fairfield's Brenna Martini, who is hitting .415 with 13 doubles, 14 homers and 61 RBIs, has led Adelphi into the Division II World Series for the second consecutive year after sweeping Southern New Hampshire in the East Super Regional while four Ithaca players lead eight Connecticut natives on the eight teams still in contention for the Division III national title.
Wallingford's Casey Gavin, whose ninth-inning walk-off RBI single sent the Bombers into the Super Regionals, leads all Ithaca starters with a .419 average, Vernon's Kelly Robichaud has a team best 12 home runs and 32 RBIs while Stamford's Allison Macari and Fairfield's Haley Congdon have combined for 21 of the team's 35 victories. Cheshire's MacKenzie Juodaitis has seven victories for Rowan, which will play Ithaca in this weekend's Super Regionals.
Former Lewis Mills standout Hope Shevchuk is hitting .319 for Division III quarterfinalist WPI, Clinton's Tori Hopkins and Kaitlyn Guild of Berlin are freshmen for Haverford with Guild ranking second on the team with a .313 batting average and 45 hits.

Texto completo:   Weeks after most New Englanders put the shovels, boots, and salt away, snow made a reappearance on Monday.
Cold air from Canada descended into New England and dumped snow onto Northern Maine and parts of Vermont at a time when most people expect to see sunshine and flowers.
Snow began to fall around midnight and dropped up to 7.5 inches Monday morning in Aroostook County, Maine, near the Canadian border, according to the National Weather Service.
"This is amazing," the NWS station in Caribou, Maine, wrote on Twitter. The town of Perham was the winner, receiving 71/2 inches, the weather service said.
Massachusetts was spared most of the late snow, but still saw some flurries in the western part of the state.
Rich Norton, a meteorologist at the station in Caribou, said the snowy system moved north into Canada.
"There's still a bit of snow south of us, but it's cleared out of northeast Aroostook County," he said. "The intensity of the snowfall is diminishing."
Monday morning's snowfall shattered a 1941 record for snow so late in May at the Caribou station, Norton said.
The snow was also two days shy of the latest snow on record, NWS Caribou posted on Twitter.
Counties in northern Vermont received up to 21/2 inches over the weekend, according to the weather service.
Less than an inch of snow was predicted for parts of New Hampshire and southern Maine, according to the weather service.

Texto completo:   HOUSING
Home-Builder Gauge Suggests Growth
A gauge of home-builder sentiment was unchanged in May, a sign of steady growth for the housing market.
The National Association of Home Builders housing-market index held at 58 this month, the trade group said Monday. A reading over 50 means most builders generally see conditions in the single-family housing market as positive.
Rising employment and low mortgage rates have helped fuel demand. That boosted expectations for sales in the next six months to the highest level of the year.

NEW ENGLAND
Mid-May Snow Hits Northern States
Snow fell in parts of Northern New England on Monday, a month before the official start of summer. The National Weather Service said 3.4 inches were recorded in the northern Maine town of Caribou early Monday, setting a record for the most snow this late in May. Five inches of snow fell in Caswell and New Sweden, Maine.
In northern New Hampshire, Pittsburg recorded 2.5 inches. The Vermont towns of Middlesex and Hyde Park got 2 inches Monday morning.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Gas prices in Maine rose slightly in the past week, but federal energy officials project summertime prices will be at their lowest since 2004.
For the year, the head of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Adam Sieminski, said last week the average household will save about $900 for 2016, compared with 2014.
From April to September, the administration projected prices would average about $2.21, which is higher than its previous forecast but 42 cents lower than last summer.
In Maine, the price hit an average of $2.30 per gallon last week, a slight increase as the national price rose nearly 2 cents to $2.22. The state price is about 36 cents lower than a year ago, according to the price tracking site GasBuddy.
Will Speer, a petroleum analyst with GasBuddy, said in a news release that demand through the summer driving season, starting Memorial Day weekend, likely will remain high.
"Gasoline demand that has already been strong this year will undoubtedly see a huge seasonal increase in demand," Speer said. "This paired with crude prices that continue to show signs of strength are going to keep further pressure on gas prices this summer."
As of Sunday, Maine's average was slightly higher than Vermont, at $2.27, and New Hampshire's, at $2.17.

Texto completo:   On the top floor of an oversized garage in the small Maine town of Carmel, Peter Cowin and his colleagues conduct some of the smelliest science experiments you'll ever find.
Many anglers are glad they do.
"It's impossible to keep clean, so it's absolutely disgusting up here," Cowin said during a 2015 interview as he led the way to the room where all the magic happens. "This is the really smelly room."
The "really smelly room" is the place where 55-gallon drums of a variety of ground-up grossness -- smelts, crayfish, earthworms, shiners and 29 other kinds of fish bait -- sit during the summer months, slowly bubbling and brewing in preparation.
After a few weeks spent "developing," as Cowin calls it, the vital liquids are removed and turned into one of the many BioEdge Fishing scents that anglers buy at Cabela's, Bass Pro Shops, and many other national retail stores. Prices at major stores typically are between $8.49 and $9.
"It can take days to get the smell off you because you get covered in the stuff when you're doing it. This place doesn't smell good now, but it smells bad then," Cowin says with a chuckle.
Since its formation in 2007, BioEdge has emerged as a major player in the field and is available in more than 300 locations in the U.S. and overseas.
BioEdge products come in two forms. One is a "potion." It's a liquid. The second is a "wand," which is more like a tube of lip balm.
Just be sure not to mistake your wand for a Chapstick when you reach into your tackle box. Cowin says the wands have been supersized since their introduction to make sure anglers don't make that mistake.
Each kind of BioEdge product has a specific application, he says.
"With the [potion] you can put it on any absorbent surface, whether that's soft plastics that absorb the oils really well [or] flies or feathers or bucktails," Cowin says. "You could put it straight on bait, but it would tend to wash off a little faster."
Cowin said he realized that just wasn't acceptable and found a way to solidify the vital bait oil, making it easier to apply to other surfaces.
"To have a scent which would stay on longer, we put that solidifying process on and made the wand, which you can then rub onto those nonabsorbent surfaces and they would hold it," he says. "Even metal will hold onto the scent for hours. That way, we can cover all the different means of presentation of an artificial but then make it small and taste like the real bait."
Cowin studied zoology on the British Isle of Man, and earned his Ph.D while developing the first commercial marine worm farm in the world. He then moved to Maine, where he ran a pilot project in Franklin that also studied the feasibility of farming marine worms.
The techniques he and others developed at that company served as the foundation for BioEdge, and many of his former colleagues became co-owners of the company. Cowin is president of that company.
Cowin said the business is simply doing things in ways that other companies haven't or can't. He's reluctant to give out any company secrets but admits he sometimes feels a bit like a mad scientist when he's working in the bait "lab."
"I've been called worse [than a mad scientist]," Cowin says. "It is a bit strange. First of all being involved in worm farming before this and then the extracts and the names [of our products] are 'potions' and 'wands,' it is a little bit of sort of moonlight and magic involved, really, in terms of working out just what it is in those baits that make them so good."
Cowin said the "brewing" process is a key to the company's success.
"Getting those extracts in good condition and putting them in a form that can be presented on a lure [is the challenge]," he says. "It's been a bit of development there, and we try to keep some of our processes secret, because no one else does it our way."
There are a couple of things Cowin will admit: To make a BioEdge potion or wand, you have to start with a lot of potentially stinky stuff, and you can't hurry the process.
"We get large volumes of things like crawfish in or herring in, and we grind them up and then make a real stew out of them," Cowin says. "We put a few other ingredients in there and then let it develop for a certain period of time at certain temperatures. Not a hot process but a process that allows those oils and various goodies in the bait to come out in a form that we can use."
And Cowin also admits that one man's "development" of ingredients could easily be described as "decay" or "rot" by another observer.
"Well, you could say it smells like rotten bait, but it depends on whether you like the smell of bait or you don't like the smell of bait," he says. "For some people it smells rotten, and for other people it smells like a result, in terms of a fish on the line."
And it's those results that keep people coming back for more.

Texto completo:   ROCKLAND, Maine -- The truck driver accused of driving drunk, speeding and operating with a revoked license in a crash that killed two people made his initial appearance Monday morning in a Maine court.
Randall Junior Weddle, 54, of Greeneville, Tennessee, appeared in Knox County Unified Court on two counts of manslaughter and two counts of aggravated driving under the influence in connection with the March 18 crash in Washington that claimed the lives of Christina Torres-York, 45, of Warren and Paul Fowles, 74, of Owls Head.
Weddle entered no plea because it was an initial appearance. Justice William Stokes kept bail at $100,000 cash, though the defense will be allowed at a future hearing to argue for a lower amount.
The next scheduled court hearing for Weddle was set for July 28 but that could change if he is indicted. The next scheduled grand jury session in Knox County is the week of June 8.
Attorney David Paris of Bath was appointed by the court to represent Weddle, who arrived in Maine on Friday evening after he waived extradition following his arrest in Virginia on May 6. Weddle is being held at the Knox County Jail in Rockland.
Paris declined comment on the case after the hearing.
Several members of the victims' families sat in the first two rows of the courtroom for Monday's hearing and then were led out by the county's victim witness advocate at the conclusion of the session.
According to an affidavit filed by the Knox County Sheriff's Office to obtain the arrest warrant for Weddle, his blood-alcohol level was 0.09 when a blood sample was taken from him by an emergency medical services worker at the scene of the crash on Route 17 near the intersection with Fitch Road.
A sample taken more than an hour later at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston allegedly resulted in a blood alcohol level of 0.073. The driver also had hydrocodone in his system, according to the police report.
Under Maine law, a person is considered operating under the influence if his or her blood alcohol level is at 0.08 or greater. Federal law states a commercial driver is under the influence if the blood alcohol level is 0.04 or greater.
Weddle told investigators at the hospital that he had not been feeling well and had taken a drug called Lortab, which contains hydrocodone, according to an affidavit filed with the court. Weddle said he had come from Tennessee and made a delivery in Massachusetts before coming to Maine to pick up lumber in Searsmont. He was heading back to Tennessee to deliver the load when the accident occurred.
Weddle's truck had been traveling 81 mph shortly before the crash and was operating at 73 mph when it occurred, according to the affidavit. That information was obtained from data downloaded from the engine control module, according to police. The speed limit is 55 mph on that section of Route 17.
Weddle was driving west near Fitch Road when the 1998 Freightliner loaded with lumber veered into the eastbound lane, according to police. Fowles was driving east in a 2009 Chevrolet Colorado and was the first vehicle in line struck by the truck.
The trailer and load of lumber then struck a 1998 Chrysler van that was behind Fowles and being driven by Torres-York. The van was pushed into a nearby field and burst into flames.
A 2014 Nissan driven by Tracy Cook, 51, of Union also was struck by the trailer, and it rolled over once before hitting another vehicle that had been following, a 2015 Kia driven by Tracy Morgan, 33, of Washington. Morgan was able to avoid being struck by the trailer after she took evasive action, but not the Nissan as it rolled over. The Nissan and the Kia came to rest in the field to the right.
Morgan was uninjured in the crash. Cook was taken by ambulance to a local hospital.
Weddle was taken by a LifeFlight helicopter to CMMC in Lewiston. A passenger in the Freightliner, Lowell Babb, 32, of Virginia, was taken to Pen Bay Medical Center in Rockport and treated for minor injuries.
The maximum possible sentence for manslaughter is 30 years in prison.
The trucking company that employed the Greeneville, Tennessee man, R & E Logistics Inc. of Chuckey, Tennessee, has a safety record far worse than the national average.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Researchers were puzzled when they found most of a group of people laid off in 2011 from Verso's Bucksport mill considered the job loss "generally good" for them and their families.
Those findings are part of a book published this year called "Surviving Job Loss: Papermakers in Maine and Minnesota," in which writers Kenneth Root and Rosmarie Park explore how downsizing in the paper industry, in general, plays out for U.S. paper mill employees.
Maine versus Minnesota
The book focuses on layoffs at Verso's Bucksport and Sartell, Minnesota, mills in 2011, then Sartell's later closure in 2012.
The results of their survey revealed a wide discrepancy in sentiment about job loss between employees at the closing Sartell mill and those in Bucksport, where the workforce was being cut by about 151 from a total of about 700 employees.
The mills were in far different circumstances at the time, with the Sartell mill prompted to close by a fatal explosion on site in 2012. Those surveys reflect not only that difference but how millworkers of different ages perceive their job prospects after the cutbacks.
At the time, the now shuttered Bucksport mill's prospects looked better, and many employees took the company's offer of early retirement, which was not offered in Sartell.
"While Bucksport workers were aware of difficulties in the paper industry, they might have thought the industry difficulties would bypass them, if for no other reason than that Verso had recently committed $40 million in modernization and expansion at their mill," they wrote. "In essence, while their mill was safe, they were out of a job. No comparable corporate investment had been recently made, or proposed, at Sartell."
The book acknowledges the 2014 announcement that Bucksport would close but focuses on the 2011 layoffs in studying how job loss affected the paper mill employees, many of whom were nearing the end of their careers, with an average age of 56.
About 41 percent of those Bucksport employees said the job loss had improved their mental and emotional health, compared with 28 percent who said it was harmful and 31 percent who cited no impact.
Those figures came from surveys completed by 67 of the former Bucksport mill employees and 96 people laid off in two separate groups at the Sartell mill.
Those surveys quantify the feelings and worries of employees in the industry hit hard by foreign competition that has either put U.S. mills out of business or forced them, like other manufacturers, to become leaner.
After buying larger coated paper competitor NewPage and trying to build a profitable business, Verso buckled to a pile of debt and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January.
National trend
Those financial troubles are part of a longer trend. The writers said more than 100 mills have closed nationwide since 2000, according figures from the Center for Paper Business and Industry Studies at Georgia Tech. Meanwhile, they wrote, there is not much academic research around that shift, which prompted their work.
"The paper industry has been in transition for many years and continues to undergo variable product demand, ownership change, international expansion, and reductions in paper machines. These factors have exacerbated downsizings and brought on permanent mill closures, creating displacement," they wrote. "Despite this, there has been little research on dislocation among paper mill workers."
The surveys looked at how different groups of employees reacted to the change, finding that younger workers were more likely to think they needed new skills or training in order to find a new job. That group did not act on that belief, however. In the case of Bucksport, those younger workers were less likely to have attended a training or educational program.
The makeup of the regional economy also had an impact on how difficult finding new work was, as well.
"Changes in the paper industry, exacerbated by a slow economic recovery, meant that finding comparable local employment would be difficult," they wrote. "This constituted the situation in Bucksport for sure, whereas the St. Cloud [Minnesota] metropolitan area offered better options for work opportunities outside the Verso mill."
Midlife career changes
The book notes changing careers will continue to be a challenge for paper industry workers, particularly older workers, as manufacturers continue to contract.
In November, Beau Sibley, 49, told the Bangor Daily News about his enrollment in culinary school to find a new career, where Sibley said he'd "have to start at the bottom and work up."
As the U.S. paper industry continues to feel the pinch of global competition, Root and Park offer six suggestions for communities and employers that could make the transition into new careers easier:
-- Stagger layoffs or have a flexible release date, so not all employees are re-entering the job market all at once.
-- Provide career counseling, financial planning help and help navigating unemployment benefits and other programs.
-- Extend the length of time from the closure announcement to the actual layoff date beyond the required 60 days.
-- Involve employees in considering ways to improve the business and avoid a closure.
On the last point, they note that, in its 2014 closure, Verso did not involve workers in such discussions or "problem solving, possibly because the company may have been more interested in closing the mill," in order to reduce capacity in the coated paper that makes up most of the business.

Texto completo:   TROY, Maine -- Since the Troy Union Church was built 175 years ago on the Bangor Road, its bell has rung out countless times to mark important moments in the town.
But the bell has essentially been silent since July 4, 1976, because the church's rotting, listing bell tower has made it unsafe to ring it vigorously. On Thursday morning, May 12, the long silence was broken when the bell rang while being lowered to the ground by a 30-ton crane. As it rang, the crew of hardworking men and a small crowd watching the show from across the road spontaneously burst into cheers.
The joyful noise of the old bell seemed to underscore a sense of optimism that the long effort to restore the historic, Greek Revival church is really getting somewhere good at last.
"It's been a long time since the bell was rung," said Jan Copley, who lives across the street from the church and who has attended services there for many years. "I think the restoration can't be done soon enough."
So far, a small group of parishioners led by Norma Rossel of Troy has spent six years and raised $107,000 to fix the church, which has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Rossel has applied for and received thousands of dollars in grants and spearheaded a church capital campaign to raise local dollars to assess, stabilize and replace the rotten tower. Although the work may still take a couple of years to complete, what happened Thursday is exciting to the Troy Union Church congregants and restorers alike. The workers used the crane to carefully lift off the bell and the remains of the rotten bell tower, work that has to be done before the tower can be rebuilt.
"If people don't take care of their heritage, it's gone," Rossel said. "Now, it'll last another 200 years."
Arron Sturgis of Preservation Timber Framing, a Berwick-based company that specializes in traditional repair of steeples, barns and timber-framed homes, has been working on the restoration effort for several years. He looked pleased as the work progressed -- carefully -- Thursday.
"It's always a little dangerous. When you have a damaged building of this degree, something could come apart. It's extremely rotten," he said. "Everything to date has just been preparation. Now we're in the middle of the river, and we can't stop now."
Because the church has a tiny congregation of just a dozen or so people and doesn't have the money to pay his company to do the whole job, Sturgis and his crew trained three local carpenters to do some of the work. The men were employed all winter building wooden trusses to replace the rotten ones, and one of them is storing the cast iron bell at his home until the replacement trusses and the rest of the bell tower components can be put in place. That should happen soon, Rossel said -- perhaps by early June.
"The goal here was to save money by training and employing local craftsmen," Sturgis said, adding that he hopes the skills they learned can be used on other projects. "There's so much church steeple work in Maine right now, we couldn't begin to do it all."
After the bell tower has been replaced and the church's structural integrity has been restored, Rossel and the congregation will work on fixing the sanctuary, which is gutted and is unusable. The Troy Union Church is clearly a work in progress, but bit by bit, it is getting there.
"It's not about the building. It's about the people and the faith," explained Sandy Fernald of Troy, a church member who watched the bell get lifted down. "But it's great, the restoration and the legacy. Everyone is so quick to tear buildings down and put up a double-wide [trailer], but history is important. We're thinking about the future generations."

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- A popular Bangor candy shop is expanding to a historic downtown building, where a familiar developer is working to breathe new life into the 165-year-old structure.
Specialty Sweets makes and sells candy of all sorts at its Springer Drive location next to Christmas Tree Shops near the Bangor Mall. Its owners, Wade and Eliza Butler, plan to open a second location at 31 Main St. by late August or early September.
Eliza Butler said their busy season tends to be around holidays, but they see an opportunity to draw new customers from downtown events.
"There's the art walk, folk festival, parades, and there's just so much going on around here that we could be a part of," she said.
Production will continue to be based at the Springer Drive store, but with the new challenge of making enough product to supply two stores.
"This will be strictly retail sales of our products," Wade Butler said during an interview Friday inside 31 Main St. The second floor will be an events space, available for rent for parties, meetings and other occasions. The Butlers will have indoor seating and hope to have seats on the sidewalk in the summer so customers can eat gelato outside.
In March, Telford Holdings purchased the building from its previous owner, Paul Cook, for $300,000. Telford Holdings is owned by Telford Allen III, whose family launched Telford Aviation in 1982 before selling the company in 2009.
Allen and Telford Holdings manager Louie Morrison were behind the redevelopment of one of downtown Bangor's most iconic buildings, the long-vacant former Merchants Bank building on Broad Street. Today, the curved building houses five luxury apartments and Evenrood's restaurant.
Most recently, 31 Main St. was home to Maine Asset Management, which only used the first two floors. Before that, the building was home to Maine Times Magazine, a monthly publication that shut down in 2004.
The upper two floors have been vacant for more than a decade. Now they're being renovated into a pair of 1,400-square-foot, two-bedroom luxury apartment units.
"We've already got one rented," Morrison said, standing inside one of the units, which are still in the very early stages of construction.
The second apartment is expected to be available starting the second week of July. Rent is expected to run about $1,800 per month, Morrison said.
High-end apartment units have been popping up in renovation projects across the downtown in recent years, and developers say the demand is still high. Often, tenants are visiting-physicians or doctoral students seeking to live in a lively downtown area.
"We hear constantly that people want to return to urban living, and we have seen tenants from Maine and from away converge in downtown, filling up the new residential units almost as fast as they can be rehabbed," Tanya Emery, the city's economic development director, said.
The four-story building at 31 Main St. was completed in 1851, and it is among the Main Street structures that narrowly survived the 1911 fire that destroyed much of Bangor's downtown.
The building has housed many businesses over the years, including The Fashion, a department store that sold "everything a woman or child needs to wear," according to an advertisement from the time. Frank Wood and Frank Ewer founded the store in 1893, according to Melissa Gerety, director of the Bangor Historical Society. In 1927, Ewer's widow, Clara, took over.
In the 1970s, the building was home to Knapp's Book and Music Store, before Knapp's relocated to a larger Main Street space just up the hill.

Texto completo:   Deirdre's column about John Christie. He was more than the great story teller and ski legend everyone around Maine knew.
When I would go hiking up the mountains around Maine with John Christie, every hike was a great adventure, and every mountain a new inspiration. And as we traveled together hiking, or skiing down mountains in the winter, John would introduce me to the many people he knew as "his friend who writes for the Portland Press Herald."
But the truth is John Christie was like a second father to me, and my life has been made richer from knowing him.
John died on May 7 at 79 after living a life full of many careers and marked by a passion for outdoor exploration. For years he owned or managed three ski areas in Maine and Vermont, and after he retired from work in advertising and as a career counselor, he became an author and columnist for this newspaper. His sons, Josh and Jake, will continue to write the outdoor adventure column they all shared for the Maine Sunday Telegram.
John had a story bank full of tales from younger years skiing at Sugarloaf and, later, camping and paddling with his wife, Marty, and Josh and Jake. I told John many times his next book - after he had written three - should be a memoir called, "A Life Well Lived."
Yet as famous a storyteller as John was in so many circles, perhaps few know what a remarkable listener he was. He remembered every detail you mentioned, every sadness or disappointment you shared. And always in response, no matter what the subject, there was hope.
Certainly, John was the gregarious, happy bard with the booming laugh so many knew. But to those who called him friend, he also was a rare being filled with a belief that life is a remarkable journey, and the future a place filled with promise.
As my heart breaks this week, it's not for the hikes or ski days we'll never share again. It is for the second dad who listened as well as anyone could, with a heart bigger than most.
[bullet] [bullet] [bullet]
John and I met after I had written an article about the history of Sugarloaf's old gondola, which John, as the ski resort's general manager, had helped install. Somewhere among his stories of the mountain, he extended to me, as he did to so many, an invitation to ski with him there. When the day came, it somehow evolved into a ridiculous race that John fashioned into a mock state championship. He had invited a contingent of spectators I didn't know, appointed a "team manager" for each of us. The prize he suggested, of course, was his favorite Canadian beer, Labatts - since he was sure to win.
This was the stuff of 14-year-olds or 20-somethings, so I was confused as to why a 70-year-old was staging such a strange event that he dubbed "The Race." Except it quickly came clear this was not just an opportunity for a laugh. I really had to beat this guy.
Still, try as I might from the summit to the base, I could not keep him in sight. As one of John's many friends, former Sugarloaf owner Warren Cook said: "He doesn't turn."
And probably in keeping with the story of John's life, that ridiculous gag gave way to a lifelong friendship. Looking back now, it seems like John simply adopted me as his daughter that day, and never looked back. I would joke to people as we traveled around the state on our hikes that he was Uncle John. When I was with him I called my dog his dog, because Bingo loved John.
John's son, Josh, once told me how babies and animals all loved his dad. But who didn't?
One day when we were all skiing together and a group of people pulled his dad away from us, I asked Josh how often that happened growing up. Josh replied that he learned as a child, "I need to share him with the world."
Many times when John would be sharing a tale of a solo ocean paddle, or a hike of some faraway mountain taken in his late 70s, I'd ask if Marty worried about his rugged backwoods outings. Sure she worried, but Marty would say, "That's John."
He almost crashed a monoplane with her once when he was flying it off Swans Island in Bass Harbor because there wasn't enough runway left on the field he took off from. So he pointed the nose down toward the ocean to get the plane to go up. When I asked Marty her version of the story, she simply said, "I trusted him."
That is a part of John Christie many don't know. Marty let her motorcycle-riding, glade-skiing, ocean-kayaking husband explore and savor Maine's outdoors, as if it were his job to do it for us all. And John adored the woman he called his soulmate. Theirs was one of the greatest love stories I've ever known. It was one more example of the caring, kind world John lived in.
[bullet] [bullet] [bullet]
John's died of an apparent heart attack while working at Camden Hills State Park, a site where he spent much of his youth. It might seem a poetic conclusion to the active life of a Maine native who was the grandson of a sporting camp owner. But for those of us who loved John, his death seems abrupt.
I fully expected to be hiking and skiing with him until he was 90. In December, he introduced me to a 95-year-old skier at Sugarloaf. To which I immediately clapped and announced: "That's you!"
Losing John does not make sense. But I also know, as his son Jake said, John would want us to tell stories. So here is one of my favorites of John Christie:
Two years ago, we planned to go hiking near Moosehead Lake. I locked myself out of my car in Portland, pushing our meeting in Augusta back an hour. Typical John, he said, "Not to worry," and declared this provided the opportunity to do a smaller but spectacular hike to a summit streaked with glacial lines.
So we headed to Bald Mountain near Rangeley along back roads and past farm fields and began hiking through the woods, swapping stories as we went. And as we neared the summit I told a story about my dad from a few months earlier. How my dad had begun getting his estate in order and asked if I wanted the jewelry he had bought my mother over the years. To which I responded, I only wanted more time with him.
Still Dad encouraged me to accept this collection of gold and diamonds "when the time came." Having never considered this before, I said, "The only thing I would want, if it even existed, was the engagement ring from my Irish grandmother from County Cavan (who died 45 years ago) to go with the one I have from my Irish grandma from Donegal."
And for about 10 seconds, Dad stared at me. Then he reached into his blazer pocket, pulled out a beautiful silver diamond ring, and held it toward me, the engagement ring that belonged to his mother.
I finished the story just as John and I got to the summit, and we walked onto it in silence. Then he pulled out his favorite Canadian beverage as we sat down and handed me a bottle. And as we looked out to the view of the Rangeley lakes I confided: "I don't know if it's possible, but I felt in that moment the Irish grandmother I never knew was hugging me, showing me how much she loved me."
And on what is now my favorite hike, John raised his glass and said: "If you believe it's true, then it can be."
So I know there will be many sad hikes to come where I will wish my friend was there with me to tell stories and make me laugh. But I also know John would want me to hang onto hope. And I believe if John said it could be true, then it can be.
He will be there with me on those mountains, hugging me and saying he loves me.

Texto completo:   The Stearns County board on Tuesday is expected to appoint Mike Williams as the new county administrator.
County commissioners last week decided to offer Williams the position, which has been vacant since longtime Administrator George Rindelaub retired at the end of March.
Rather than a contract, the board will consider an informal agreement with Williams, who is St. Cloud's city administrator.
Under the agreement negotiated by human resources staff and Williams, he would start July 11. His initial salary would be $160,089, and he would be placed on the county's pay plan as all other non-union employees. He would also receive insurance benefits and six weeks of paid time off.
Rindelaub's annual salary as of January was $165,334.
Williams has worked for the city of St. Cloud for the last 13 years. He previously held positions in Brookings, South Dakota; Becker County; Perry, Iowa; and Easton, Maine. He has a doctorate degree in public policy and administration.
Williams beat out three other finalists for the job: Scott Arneson, Goodhue County administrator; Steve Hammes, Stearns County assistant to the county administrator; and Timothy Houle, Crow Wing County administrator.
The county board meeting is scheduled for 9 a.m. Tuesday at the Administration Center, 705 Courthouse Square.

Resumen: Veteran driver Roger Labreche brought his familiar No. 100 car to victory lane for the first time on U.S. soil by winning the Sportsman Modified feature in NASCAR Whelen All-American Series action at Airborne Park Speedway on Saturday night. The event was delayed and interrupted several times by cold rain and saw a number of top contenders drop out with mechanical issues.

Texto completo:   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. - Eddie MacDonald was not expecting to win the Spring Green 116 on Saturday night, but to his surprise he celebrated in victory lane. The Rowley, Mass., driver and first-time full-season competitor on the American-Canadian Tour led only the final 10 laps at a rain-plagued Airborne Park Speedway to take his first win of the season.
Known as "The Outlaw" for his tendency to race in any type of stock car at any track and not retain an allegiance to a particular series -- from the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series to local short tracks -- MacDonald is no certainly stranger to the Tour, but is heading against his own grain by chasing the full-season ACT schedule and aiming at the 2016 championship. In limited participation since 2007, he had already won a dozen ACT-sanctioned races from Maine to Florida.
However, MacDonald had never been successful in Plattsburgh and didn't think that his car was good enough on Saturday to win one of the area's most prestigious Late Model events. When the race was delayed for the second time by rain two laps past the halfway point, MacDonald sat in sixth place, well behind a battle for the lead between Barre's Nick Sweet and Quebec's Patrick Laperle -- recently two of ACT's best at Airborne.
But the rain subsided following a nearly half-hour delay, and a final restart on lap 69 set up a long green-flag run to the finish that played to MacDonald's advantage. Lapped traffic hampered the leaders as MacDonald's car came into a strong rhythm, and he moved to Sweet's outside on lap 105. Sweet pushed it three-wide with MacDonald and a backmarker, but MacDonald was able to drive away and take the win.
Sweet took the runner-up spot with Laperle third.
"I was just really hoping for a top-five with the way the weather was. I thought we were only going to run to halfway," MacDonald told Vermont Motorsports Magazine. "This car, it seemed, as the run went on, the harder I drove it the faster it went. Luckily, the lapped cars really helped us; it slowed Nick down a little bit. I tried to use that to help us get by him. We usually struggle [at Airborne] so this is huge for our team."
Local favorite Brandon Atkins of Au Sable Forks, N.Y., led laps early and finished fourth, with Milton's Scott Payea fifth. Polesitter Alex Labbe, Jimmy Hebert, Rowland Robinson Jr., Dillon Moltz, and Wayne Helliwell Jr. completed the top 10.
Sweet, riding the momentum of a win at Thunder Road one week earlier, took over the ACT point lead. MacDonald is nine points behind (421-412), followed by Payea and Hebert. Previous point leader Bobby Therrien of Hinesburg was involved in a crash and finished 29th in the race, dropping to fifth in the standings.
The ACT Late Models head to New London-Waterford Speedbowl on the Connecticut shoreline next Saturday.
Labreche logs first win: Veteran driver Roger Labreche brought his familiar No. 100 car to victory lane for the first time on U.S. soil by winning the Sportsman Modified feature in NASCAR Whelen All-American Series action at Airborne Park Speedway on Saturday night. The St-Remi, Que., racer led all 35 laps. Danny Sullivan finished second with Bucko Branham third.
Tylor Terry of Morrisonville, N.Y., used a late pass of Shawn Duquette to win the Renegade feature, and Josh LaPorte of Peru, N.Y., won the Mini-Modified race.
Pierson perfect at Bear Ridge: Adam Pierson made it back-to-back victories in the DIRTcar Sportsman Modified division at Bear Ridge Speedway in Bradford on Saturday night. The East Corinth driver blasted through the field from the 21st starting spot to take the 40-lap main event and remain unbeaten through the first two weeks of racing at the track.
Former three-time Bear Ridge champion Gary Siemons finished second with Allan Hammond third.
Danville rookie T.J. Morse was a first-time winner in the Limited Late Model division, and Buddy Welch of East Corinth won the Four Cylinder race. New Hampshire racers Rich Crooker and Bob Griffin split Granite State Mini Sprint features. The Sportsman Coupe feature was halted by rain with seven laps complete; Earl Maxham will led the field when the race is resumed next Saturday night.
Hall picks up PASS win: Garrett Hall of Scarborough, Maine, became the first repeat winner of the season on the Pro All Stars Series, winning at a soggy Speedway 95 bear Bangor on Sunday afternoon. The event was delayed and interrupted several times by cold rain and saw a number of top contenders drop out with mechanical issues.
Derek Griffith passed Mike Hopkins late in the race for the runner-up spot; the top three finishers have been new breakout stars for the Maine-based PASS tour in 2016. Former champion D.J. Shaw finished fourth with Trevor Sanborn fifth.

Texto completo:   A community solar farm in Wayne, known as Sky Ranch, went online this spring.
Nine invested in solar array overlooking Androscoggin Lake in Wayne
WAYNE -- Watching things leave and return to earth was a regular part of Rosanne Graef's childhood. Her father, Howard Holman, was a commercial pilot who enjoyed flying smaller planes in his free time and built an airstrip on their 90-acre property overlooking Androscoggin Lake.
Holman is now deceased, but his daughter has ensured his celestial wanderings won't be forgotten. Five solar panels now sit on a quarter acre of land next to that unused airstrip, grazing on the sunshine through which Holman once flew.
Like Holman's airstrip, the solar farm is now known as "Sky Ranch."
Besides being a tribute to her father, that name also hints at the reason Graef, who inherited the land but now lives in Portland, and eight other Central Maine Power customers collectively contributed $200,000 to have the photovoltaic panels installed.
Community solar farms, as such setups are known, are designed for those ratepayers who would like to get their electricity from the sun, but can't install solar panels on their own home for whatever reason: Their rooftops aren't large enough, they rent an apartment, trees block the sunlight.
Shade isn't an issue at Sky Ranch, where on a recent weekday afternoon the rays were coming down unabated. They were striking the five south-facing panels, getting converted to a direct electric current at inverters attached to each unit and flowing out onto transmission lines owned by Central Maine Power.
The farm's total output is measured by a CMP meter at the entrance to the property.
The nine ratepayers who invested in the farm now see a credit on their power bill for the amount that's generated. They pay additional transmission fees to CMP and leasing fees to Graef, who owns the land underneath the solar panels. For their investments, they see a 30 percent federal tax rebate.
The design and construction of the array took about six months. It went online earlier this spring, becoming the fifth such array in Maine, according to engineer Hans Albee of ReVision Energy, the company that carried out the Sky Ranch project.
Albee said another five community solar farms are in the works for 2016, including one in South China. Such farms do not account for a very large share of the state's power mix.
And when it comes to size, they don't compare to some of the larger solar arrays either built or planned around the state. The Wayne farm's generating capacity, 49.6 kilowatts, is less than 5 percent of what Bowdoin College generates at its 1.2 megawatt array. Colby College is planning to build a 1.9 megawatt array, and a developer is moving forward with a 50-megawatt solar project in Sanford, which could be the state's largest.
But the growth in smaller solar projects at the community, rooftop and municipal scales does hint at the rising demand for renewable energy sources around Maine and the shrinking costs of solar power equipment.
For Graef, the investment in solar energy now won't pay off for at least a decade. That's when her upfront costs will be completely offset by the credits she has earned on her power bills. Still, she takes heart that fewer fossil fuels will ultimately get burned to satisfy her energy needs.
"It would be nice to have savings, but that was not really the prime motivator for me," she said. "I really feel very strongly that every single thing that we have here is from the sun ultimately. The sun is doing all this stuff, and we're stupid not to exploit that. I was a science teacher. I consider myself an environmentalist. When I saw that they were looking for places to position these solar farms, I was very interested, and I thought it would be a good fit. You want to do things to help your society."
Another bonus, Graef added, is that the solar array helps preserve the land and views at her childhood home. While gardens would have the same effect, it would be tough to convert the land there to fertile soil, she said.
Whether more Maine customers can get energy savings from solar is an open question.
The ability of solar power to meet Maine's energy needs recently came under the microscope, when lawmakers approved a bill that aimed to add 196 megawatts of solar to the state's power mix over the next four years, but were not able to override Gov. Paul LePage's veto of the bill.
Although the bill was supported by a range of parties who don't always see eye-to-eye -- solar advocates, environmentalists, utility companies, the state's public advocate -- LePage argued it would favor one energy source over another and raise the state's electricity costs.
The law would have changed how solar power is priced, and some supporters argued those changes would encourage larger scale solar projects that lower costs for all energy consumers.

Texto completo:   IT COULDN'T HAVE come at a better time.
Just when I thought my head would explode if I heard one more mention of "presumptive" presidential nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, along came last week's riveting showdown between the Maine Sunday Telegram and the Maine Warden Service over "North Woods Lawless."
That was the banner over last Sunday's story and sidebars by staff writer Colin Woodard about "Operation Red Meat," a two-year, over-the-top undercover investigation by the warden service in the backwoods of Aroostook County. The headline plays off "North Woods Law," the Animal Planet TV show that captured the drama -- or lack thereof -- for the whole world to see.
In the days since the story ran, we've had calls by legislators on both sides of the aisle for hearings on who did what and why, followed by full-throated condemnations of Woodard and this newspaper by Gov. Paul LePage and the game wardens, followed by more reports of questionable tactics by the warden service and the undercover agent it's used, year after year, to reel in the hapless poachers.
So here I sit, still catching my breath from it all.
And I've got a few questions:
[bullet] First and foremost, do Maine's game wardens know their Alces alces from their Prunus persica?
The former is the scientific name for Maine's moose. The latter is Latin for the peach.
I ask this because the wardens, in their rather disjointed 2,800-word response to "North Woods Lawless," acknowledge that they mistook jars of "vegetables" for jars of moose meat while raiding the home of Hope Kelly, the mother of one of the defendants in Operation Red Meat.
As for Ms. Kelly's claim that they also made off with her prized stock of home-canned peaches, however, the wardens insisted, "At no point did the warden service seize peaches."
Yet in an evidence photo taken that night by the wardens, right next to a jar of what looks like not-so-red Alces alces is a jar of bright orange Prunus persica.
Go figure.
[bullet] Why won't the Maine Warden Service answer the Maine Sunday Telegram's questions?
For more than six months, reporter Woodard repeatedly has requested interviews with everyone from Col. Joel Wilkinson, commander of the warden service, on down. And the warden service's terse response to Woodard's written questions, repeatedly labeling this or that criticism against them "completely inaccurate and untrue," reads like a heavily sterilized court deposition.
And now they complain, ad nauseam, that their side of the story isn't being told.
[bullet] How much did Operation Red Meat cost?
Reasonable people can disagree on whether two years of an undercover agent's time, along with a raid involving some 30 game wardens and state police backup, was worth the subsequent two arrests and array of non-felony charges against 21 others back in February 2014.
But in order for taxpayers to make that judgment, the least the Maine Warden Service could do is put a price tag on the whole thing. Which they won't.
Why not?
[bullet] Why won't the Maine Warden Service release the emails between game wardens and the "North Woods Law" production company?
This would seem pretty simple. On Nov. 2, 2015, Woodard and the Maine Sunday Telegram submitted a request under the Maine Freedom of Access Act seeking all emails between the wardens and Engel Entertainment, the producers of "North Woods Law." The Maine Warden Service initially estimated it would take about six hours to fulfill the request.
More than six months later, they still haven't forked them over.
So even as they thump their chests about enforcing Maine law, let's not forget that they're simultaneously breaking it.
[bullet] Whose side is Maine's public access ombudsman on?
Her name is Brenda Kielty and her job, according to the state's website, is "to review complaints about compliance with the Freedom of Access Act and attempt to mediate their resolution."
According to an endless email chain between the newspapers, the warden service and associated lawyers that now reads like an Abbott and Costello routine, Kielty first got involved in the Freedom of Access dispute on Jan. 20. It's now May 15 with no resolution in sight.
Suggested question for Ms. Kielty: For an agency that specializes in search and rescue, how hard can it be to find a few emails?
[bullet] How long is too long for an agent to remain undercover?
William Livezey, the undercover agent at the heart of this and countless other raids, has been scurrying around Maine playing good-old-boy Pennsylvania hunter Bill Fried for at least a dozen years, maybe a lot longer.
It's hard to fathom, from one investigation to another, that nobody has recognized him. You've also got to wonder, after all those years playing a lawbreaker so convincingly, if he still recognizes himself.
[bullet] What's with all the beer?
Everywhere Livezey/Fried goes, he seems to have a 12-pack under his arm. He apparently favors Yuengling, which is a clever choice because it's brewed in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and is not distributed in Maine.
But by all accounts (except, of course, that of the Maine Warden Service), Livezey/Fried does a lot of drinking on the job. Assuming he expenses his, ahem, accessories, might taxpayers be entitled to a look-see at all those years of Yuengling receipts?
[bullet] And while we're on the topic of beer, what's the deal with that garbage can?
According to a story in Friday's Portland Press Herald, Livezey/Fried once became so drunk during an investigation in York County that he tumbled into a garbage can. Then, according to a target of that operation, he insisted on getting into his car and driving miles to his hotel.
Too bad the "North Woods Law" cameras weren't rolling for that one. When it comes to reality TV, that's lightning in a bottle.
[bullet] Why are 15 pages of a 16-page state policy redacted?
Talk about pure, unadulterated arrogance.
The Maine Sunday Telegram requests a copy of the Maine Warden Service policy on "special investigations" and, upon delivery, virtually the entire thing is blacked out except for some introductory chatter and a few scattered definitions.
And, right at the end, this: "News, Media and Press: Inquiries from the press, news media and other public information outlets will be forwarded to the Augusta office for response by the Colonel, Major or as otherwise directed by the Colonel or Major."
I'm surprised they didn't draw in an upraised middle finger.
[bullet] When is the Maine Warden Service going to stop lying about the Portland Press Herald?
In a statement released Friday evening, warden service spokesman Cpl. John MacDonald claimed that the Press Herald failed to report on the shooting of two New Hampshire police officers early that morning because "they would rather focus on their attempts to smear rather than report on newsworthy events."
The shootings in Manchester occurred at 2 a.m. Six hours later, at 8:03 a.m., the story was posted on the Press Herald website.
And we're the ones not telling the truth.
[bullet] Finally, who spooked the legislators?
Immediately after "North Woods Lawless" broke, lawmakers from both parties promised to pick up where the story left off and start demanding answers to the questions that the Maine Warden Service continues to ignore.
Then Gov. Paul LePage opened fire on the newspaper -- like nobody saw that coming -- and the whole thing took on the specter of yet another political fight that could now sputter to a halt at the edge of Augusta's great partisan divide.
Let's hope not.
The only real way to end this thing is to choose the appropriate legislative committee -- preferably one with subpoena power -- and call in Agent Livezey/Fried and his handlers for a long overdue chat.
They can bring the beer.
Or at least a jar of Prunis persica.

Texto completo:   kj.prisonerpetitioner.0515: Convicted murdered Jeffrey LeGassie is helping, from behind bars, orgainze a petition drive to seek to get a question on the 2018 Maine ballot that'd create a reentry program for Maine prisoners. Program participants, who'd have to be on good behaviour in prison, could be released out of prison soon, into a supervised/monitored release program and agree to drug/alcohol etc testing. LeGassie and other proponents say most prisoners are going to get out at some point, so wouldn't you rather they get released through a reentry program under some supervision, earlier, than just be released with no assistance or restrictions when their time is up.
Like most inmates in Maine State Prison, convicted murderer Jeffrey LaGasse will one day be released.
He sees two very different realities awaiting him and prisoners like him on the other side of the prison walls.
If he serves the remaining approximately 20 years of his 30-year sentence, he could be released with no monitoring, supervision, or restrictions and few job prospects in the community as a newly released felon. Or, under a proposal LaGasse is championing from behind bars, he could be released from prison before his sentence is up, enabling him to live in the community under monitoring by a probation officer. He and others would be required to check in with authorities, agree to random drug and alcohol testing, and be given time and support to get re-established in the community and find a job and stable housing.
Which outcome would Mainers prefer for the state's inmates? LaGasse and prison reform advocates want that question to be decided at the ballot box.
LaGasse, convicted of murdering Louise Brochu in 2007 in New Portland in what he describes as a burglary gone wrong, is working with other prisoners and their supporters on the outside on a petition that is expected to be released for circulation by the Maine Department of the Secretary of State this week. It seeks to place a referendum question on the 2018 state ballot asking voters to agree to create a new "positive re-entry program" for Maine inmates to help reintegrate them back into society.
LaGasse, 36, said now there is essentially no established, effective re-entry program for Maine prisoners. So when some inmates complete their sentences, they are released from prison to fend for themselves in a society they haven't been part of in some cases for decades and without positive connections in the community, he said.
Some prisoners who wouldn't otherwise ever be able to leave prison would be eligible to participate under the program's proposed language. Prisoners serving life sentences would be eligible and could get out of prison and into the community if they meet the program requirements and agree to be monitored in some form after serving as few as 20 years.
That possibility is drawing alarm from victims' advocates who say the proposed language goes too far.
Arthur Jette, Maine chapter leader of Parents of Murdered Children, whose 21-month-old grandson, Treven Cunningham, was murdered in Dexter in 1999, said he thinks any proposal to let prisoners serving life sentences out of prison is incomprehensible. He said life sentences are reserved for people who've committed the most heinous crimes, who took the lives of one or more people. He said both the Maine chapter and national organization oppose anyone with a life sentence being given an opportunity to be released from prison.
"It's incomprehensible why we would want to take the risk of putting those individuals back into society," he said. "They've already killed once. They've shown a propensity to kill. The No. 1 priority of the state, of government in general, is to provide safety for its citizens. And I can't see anything that would undermine that effort more than considering the release of people who've killed and want a chance to be free and maybe kill again."
Inmates who meet program requirements who were sentenced to between one and 25 years could be released after serving at least half their sentence. Inmates serving a sentence of 25 years to life could be released after serving 20 years.
Those inmates would be released into society but still required to serve out the remainder of the term in the program. LaGasse said inmates would be eligible for the program if they maintain good behavior while in prison and show they're taking steps to improve themselves such as by taking classes or participating in drug or alcohol abuse prevention programs. The program would require them to be monitored by and check in with authorities, likely probation officers, and they would have to comply with conditions of their release including curfews and no use of drugs or alcohol.
Such inmates would live in either halfway houses or similar facilities, or in independent housing such as their own home with other residents of the home vetted by the Department of Corrections. Rules violations, if serious, would get the inmate put back into prison. LaGasse said conditions could include requiring inmates released to their own homes to only be able to leave for work or approved appointments and to wear ankle bracelets that would track their movements.
The proposed referendum would establish a parole-board-like committee of citizens with a variety of relevant expertise who would determine whether inmates qualify and whether they would be a risk to society if they were released.
LaGasse argues most inmates will be getting out of prison someday anyway, so Maine residents would be better off if those inmates are released to a monitored re-entry program that would reduce the chances they'll re-offend and end up back in prison.
"I believe the citizens of Maine would like to know individuals are getting programs to be properly reintegrated and be properly supervised when they're released, rather than getting out with $50 or nothing in their pocket and a bus ticket to nowhere to go crash on someone's couch," LaGasse said in a recent interview at the Maine State Prison in Warren. "It would cut back on recidivism, it would cut back on so many people being incarcerated, and it would save taxpayers a substantial amount of money."
Volunteers with the Maine chapter of CURE, or Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants, a nonprofit organization which advocates for prison reform, plan to circulate the petition to put the proposal to create the positive re-entry program before Maine voters.
Neda Washer, president of the organization, said inmates are human beings who've made bad choices in life. She said now, with only limited programs meant to help them prepare to return to society, prisoners are being set up to fail, because they aren't being provided the education and skills they need to go back into the community and succeed.
The positive re-entry program, she said, would allow prisoners who prove they are committed to improving themselves and not re-offending to be released from prison while still being monitored by authorities. They would live in a halfway house or in home confinement for the remainder of their sentences. And if they violate any of the rules, they'd be placed back in prison.
"A lot of people think if you're in prison, that's where you belong and you will never change," she said. "But people can change. Most of these people are going to be out in the community at some point. And we want them to be out there with the support they need to be successful."
Washer said she's motivated, in part, by her love for an inmate she met while he was already incarcerated at Maine State Prison, Santanu "Sam" Basu, a 48-year-old convicted murderer sentenced in 2004 to 62 years in prison. If the positive re-entry program is created, he could be eligible to be released from prison after he serves at least 20 years of his sentence and then serve out the remainder of his term supervised in the community if he meets its requirements. Without any changes, he'd be in prison until his late 80s.
Basu is one of four Maine State Prison inmates working on the proposal with LaGasse. The others are Dana A. Craney, 53, who is serving a 60-year sentence for murder; Doug A. Dyer, 43, who is serving a 40-year term for murder; and Gary L. Sweeney, 58, who is serving a 40-year term for murder.
Cathi Gonzalez, coordinator of Maine CURE's efforts to petition for the positive re-entry program, said inmates lose touch with society while they are incarcerated, don't have connections to find jobs and often don't have positive role models they can turn to.
She said the re-entry program would provide them access to services such as counseling, to help finding employment and to mental health treatment.
She said her now-ex-husband was incarcerated, and when he got out of prison a few years ago, he didn't have a job, couldn't find any support groups for help and, as a felon, had a hard time getting an apartment. They were divorced within six months of his release, and now she fears he could be on his way back to prison.
"Most often when these inmates are being released into society, they're not fully prepared," she said. "Some don't have anywhere to go. They've lost touch with all the support they had, and they return back to the same lifestyle they left, which is usually not good. With this program we can offer some guidance and a slow re-entry, so they're better prepared to be law-abiding citizens. It's not a get out of jail free card. It's, 'Do you want to make better choices and become a better person?'"
Jette said he thinks redemption should be reserved for criminals who commit nonviolent crimes. He said it is easy for inmates to appear to have changed themselves for the better and even be considered to be model citizens, because prison is a structured and controlled environment. In prison, most of their decisions are made for them, so they need only comply with the rules. He also said everybody finds God when they're in jail.
Jette said many families of victims are already upset that inmates can get out before their sentences are up for "good time" by behaving themselves while they are incarcerated. They surely don't want to see inmates get out even earlier through a re-entry program.
"We don't see any justification for early release, and we're not supportive of any so-called positive re-entry programs," Jette said. "It sounds like a very serious injustice, at the end of it all, to have someone take a life or multiple lives and serve just 25 years and then be able to enjoy 25 wonderful years having a family life with somebody they love after they've denied the same thing for somebody else for their own selfish reasons."
LaGasse said he takes responsibility for killing Brochu. He said he didn't intend to kill her, describing the incident as a burglary gone bad.
Brochu's family members, during LaGasse's trial, described her as a hardworking, funny, friendly woman, and a great mom to her daughter, Emily.
Her body was found June 8, 2007, under a pile of roofing metal in the mill yard at New Portland Wood Flooring, her business on Route 27 next to her home.
LaGasse, who had previously done some work for Brochu, lived nearby and reported her missing.
He initially pleaded not guilty, but later changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in state prison under an agreement between his attorneys and prosecutors.
LaGasse said he is ashamed and sorry for both what he did and who he was back then.
"I want everybody to know how sorry I am for what I did," he said. "I know sorry can never be good enough. You can never give back something you've taken from somebody. I'm the one who did that. It wasn't alcohol or drugs. It was me. I'm so ashamed of myself for that."
After he was convicted, he was given a chance by the judge to speak to the court or the Brochu family. He said nothing.
LaGasse said he regrets not apologizing to the family in court and said his lawyer told him not to do so.
He said he recently received permission from the Department of Corrections to write an apology letter to the family, which he plans to do soon.
"I wanted to say I was sorry (in court). I regret that," LaGasse said. "I want to help them in any way I can with the grieving and healing process. They deserve to know that, to know I'm sorry."
Brochu family members could not be reached for comment.
LaGasse said back then he was egotistical, stubborn and selfish, drank alcohol every day, and took Adderall, a stimulant, to keep going when he was drinking.
From 1998 to 2004, LaGasse was in prison for other crimes, on arson and burglary charges. He said if a program like the positive re-entry program had existed then, it might have prevented him from returning to his old ways by giving him the tools and positive influences to make better decisions.
He says he has changed in prison now, taking substance abuse classes, parenting classes so he can be a better parent to his four now-grown children, classes in psychology, finances, anger management and others meant to make him a better person.
He thinks the proposed positive re-entry program could help others change by giving them incentive to better themselves and decrease the chances they'll commit another crime and return to prison.
"This is my way of giving back, working on this program, to prevent others from ending up coming back here, and so individuals don't have to go through what I've put other people through," he said in an interview room at Maine State Prison. "Because I walk around here all day and see things that were in a young me in the other people here. By giving people an opportunity to be in this program, I believe it will help them see the mistakes they've made so they can change."
He said he hopes crime victims and their families would take some solace in knowing that the perpetrator of that crime, when they get out of prison, would be reintegrated properly in the program, so they would be less likely to re-offend or commit new crimes.
Both proponents and opponents of creating a positive re-entry program for Maine prisoners say recidivism data support their stance.
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which studied recidivism in prisoners in 30 states from 2005 to 2010, 68 percent of released prisoners were arrested for a new crime within three years.
Jette said those data illustrate that inmates are highly likely to commit another crime when they are released, so they should not be released early.
Washer and Gonzalez said the re-entry program would decrease the odds an inmate will commit another crime by giving inmates a better, supported re-entry into society.
While data on recidivism are prevalent, data on whether re-entry or parole programs reduce recidivism are sparse and inconsistent.
A 2006 Urban Institute report, "Does Parole Supervision Work?" found 62 percent of inmates released with no conditions were rearrested within two years, compared with 54 percent of inmates released before their sentences were complete whose releases were screened by a parole board and supervised.
A 2013 analysis of New Jersey data commissioned by The PEW Charitable Trusts found that inmates released to parole supervision were less likely to be rearrested, reconvicted and re-incarcerated for new crimes than inmates who serve their full terms and are released without supervision. But the two groups returned to prison at almost identical rates as parolees were sent back to prison for technical violations such as failing drug tests or missing meetings. In that study, 25 percent of parolees returned to prison within three years, compared to 39 percent of inmates who completed their terms and were released unsupervised. However, when technical violations are included, 38 percent of parolees were returned to prison.
Another PEW commissioned study, a 2014 report done after the Kentucky Legislature passed a measure to create a mandatory re-entry supervision policy that required every inmate to undergo post-release supervision, showed new offense rates reduced by 30 percent, 872 more prison beds available per year, and $29 million in savings in the 27 months after the policy was implemented. Inmates released into mandatory re-entry supervision were 30 percent less likely to return to prison for a new crime within one year of release.
To successfully make it onto the ballot, the petition drive must secure at least 61,123 valid signatures -- 10 percent of the total votes cast for governor in the Nov. 4, 2014, elections.
Maine Department of Corrections officials declined to be interviewed for this story or provide information about what exists for re-entry programs in Maine now, beyond stating the department does have Correction Care and Treatment workers who do re-entry work with offenders.
Jody Breton, deputy commissioner, said Maine CURE's positive re-entry proposal is similar to previously rejected legislation that would have created a new parole system.
Maine hasn't had parole since 1979, when it became the first state in the country to get rid of parole and replace it with determinate sentences, in which the judge sets a specific prison term.
In 2013, "An Act to Establish Positive Re-entry Parole," sponsored by Sen. John Tuttle, D-Sanford, didn't move forward after the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee voted "ought not to pass" on the proposal.
While testifying against that proposal for the Department of Corrections, Breton said the department objected to parole due to the indeterminate nature of the sentence, the uncertainty created for both victims and offenders, and the possibility of re-victimization of crime victims by the need to appear before the parole board, according to written testimony.
LaGasse said that proposal was flawed in part because it wouldn't have required inmates to show they'd made efforts to improve themselves to be eligible for release from prison. He said proponents also didn't do enough to educate the public about it and its potential benefits. He said the new proposal would more properly reintegrate prisoners back into the community.
He said it would cost less than re-establishing parole, too, because it wouldn't be overseen by a full-time parole board. Instead, a committee of citizens would be established, and members would be paid only when they were meeting, not full time. The committee would review inmates' eligibility for the program, including reviewing their likelihood of re-offending. The committee as proposed would include a licensed alcohol and drug counselor, a licensed mental health professional, a case manager who works with health and human services agencies, a physician and the director of security for the Department of Corrections, all appointed by the governor.
Washer and LaGasse said the program would save the state a substantial amount of money, because prisoners, once released from prison to be monitored in the community, would pay the halfway house or other facility to reimburse their housing and other costs once they get a job. They said the only cost of the program to the state would be stipends paid to members of the citizen committee when they meet to consider inmate applications to enter the program.
The average annual cost to house an inmate in Maine, according to a study by the Vera Institute of Justice, "The Price of Prisons: What Incarceration costs taxpayers," based on 2010 data, was $46,400 a year. LaGasse said it would cost much less than half that for inmates in the program.
Incarceration costs can grow as inmates age and their need for medical care increases, Washer said. If they're housed outside of prison in an assisted living facility, the federal government may help pay the cost of their health care, rather than that cost falling on the state Department of Corrections if the inmate remains in prison.
LaGasse said he understands what it's like to have someone taken from your life suddenly, the way he took Brochu away from her family. The mother of LaGasse's 21-year-old son, Dominic Sargent, was killed in a triple murder in 2014 just three days after she and LaGasse spoke, he said for the first time, about their son.
Christina Sargent, 36, and her two other children, 10-year-old Duwayne Coke and 8-year-old Destiny Sargent, were killed in their Garland home in December 2014. His son Dominic, LaGasse said, found the three bodies Dec. 20, 2014, in the mobile home his mother and her two other children shared with Keith Coleman. Coleman, 28, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of murder and one count of gross sexual assault and is awaiting trial. His trial is scheduled for Aug. 1, according to a Penobscot County court clerk. Coleman is being held at Maine State Prison, where LaGasse is also an inmate.
LaGasse said he has a lot of anger toward Coleman for what he allegedly did. But he said if the two come across each other in prison, he would not seek retribution.
LaGasse expressed doubt that Coleman, if he is found guilty, would qualify for the positive re-entry program because of the severity of his alleged crimes. But he said if he did, he would be OK with Coleman participating and being released from prison early to serve out part of his sentence in the community.
"I'd want this program to work for everybody, and you know what, as long as (Coleman) is doing the right thing, to better himself, absolutely," LaGasse said. "He's going to pay the price by having to be here before he can figure it out. He may not. I look at what I've done and the person I've become now. But not everybody can change."

Resumen: Hosted by MaineGeneral Medical Center's Horizon Program, which provides medical and social services to people with HIV/AIDS, the money helps clients who need a little extra help with dental work, fuel, security deposits, eye exams, eyeglasses and other necessities. Many partners in a long-term relationship or marriage are able to stay HIV/AIDS-free, even if the other partner is diagnosed with it, through proper education and preventive measures, they said.

Texto completo:   NANCY RUSSELL AND Dennis Mills wrack their brains, trying to figure out why they can't seem to get more people to take part in the 5K walk/run they are organizing to benefit people living with HIV/AIDS in mid-coast and central Maine.
Could it be that they don't advertise it well enough? Or that people are afraid to be affiliated with those who have the disease?
They believe the stigma around HIV/AIDS is still strong, even though people work hard to educate others about the disease which affects people just like you and me.
Mills and Russell are planning the AIDS Walk of Central Maine to be held from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at Quarry Road Recreation Area in Waterville. Hosted by MaineGeneral Medical Center's Horizon Program, which provides medical and social services to people with HIV/AIDS, the money helps clients who need a little extra help with dental work, fuel, security deposits, eye exams, eyeglasses and other necessities.
Russell, 72, has had HIV 27 years and is a peer advocate and special events coordinator for the Horizon Program. She says she often hears about walks for domestic violence, breast cancer and other causes where hundreds of people take part and raise up to $30,000.
She dreams of having such a turnout for the AIDS Walk, which has been held six years and each year draws only about 60 or 70 participants. They typically raise a few thousand dollars and while the money is greatly appreciated, she wishes it were more.
"I would definitely love to see more participate, therefore more dollars coming in, because we know it goes to a good cause -- to the clients who really need it," she said. "So many clients have dental needs. Everything is expensive now. Everywhere, funding is being cut. We get federal money, we get some grant money, but the pots keep getting smaller and smaller, so this is one way that we can raise funds, and we'd love to raise more."
Walkers, runners and volunteers -- and more volunteers
are needed, she said -- have a wonderful time. They have a cookout, silent auction, entertainment and children's activities in addition to the 5K. Walkers or runners may ask people to help sponsor them by donating money. Participants may donate money themselves. People may sign up by calling Horizon at 621-3785, extension 5, or by going to the website www.give.mainegeneral.org/AIDSWALK. They also may just show up the day of the event to register. The registration fee is $15, but it is waived for those who can not afford to pay it.
Russell, who has raised $2,165 so far herself, spoke about the fundraiser this week while sitting at Mills' kitchen table in Waterville.
They talked about HIV/AIDS and about how medications are so much better than they were many years ago and people are living a long time with the disease. One client in the program has lived with HIV for 33 years, they said.
They spoke about misconceptions around HIV/AIDS and why it is important for children and adults to be educated about it. For instance, one can not contract HIV through sharing dishes or a toilet or by hugging someone. It is contracted through bodily fluids such as blood or semen or by sharing needles, they said. Many partners in a long-term relationship or marriage are able to stay HIV/AIDS-free, even if the other partner is diagnosed with it, through proper education and preventive measures, they said.
People should get tested for HIV/AIDS if they suspect they could have it, as early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in a person's health, they said.
In Maine there are a little more than 1,800 known cases of HIV/AIDS, and each year 50,000 new cases are diagnosed in the U.S. One in four are women, according to Russell. Anyone can get HIV/AIDS. It is not a gay man's disease as it was once thought to be, according to Russell, who is heterosexual, lives in Waterville and contracted HIV from a one-time encounter with a neighbor in Florida many years ago.
Mills, 61, was diagnosed with HIV six years ago after having worked as a registered nurse 37 years in Maine, Boston and California and working mostly in locked psychiatric units. He said many people who have HIV can not work because of their illness and related physical issues, and it is difficult for them to get dental care beyond the $750 annually they get as part of their disability. Teeth are important because when your teeth are bad, it affects the rest of your body, Mills said.
A Maine native, Mills moved back here from California about a year ago because he could no longer work and the cost of living was too high there. He had been in a long-term relationship with a man, and six years ago they broke up. Afterward, Mills became sick and learned only after the fact that his former partner had HIV but was too terrified to tell him.
Since being diagnosed, Mills has had six heart attacks, but is doing much better now, he said. The first heart attack occurred before he was diagnosed, when his body was being attacked by the virus but he did not know it.
Sadly, Mills knows people whose families have disowned them because they learn they are gay, he said. Mills, who holds a master's degree in theology and health management from Duke University, said he also has spoken with pastors who believe people get HIV/AIDS because they are sinners.
"It's very sad," Russell said in response to his comment.
Neither Mills nor Russell looks sick. In fact, they appear healthy and strong. They said they receive excellent medical care at the Horizon Program, which has a clinic in Gardiner and an office for case management and social services on Green Street in Augusta.
The program also offers superb emotional support through groups and social events for the 192 or so clients, 25 of whom are women.
"It's been nothing but a blessing," Mills said of the program. "Everyone is great -- case management, nurses. Everyone who works there is very caring and very compassionate."
Russell said that often new clients are frightened after being diagnosed, and when she tells them she has had HIV 27 years, they look at her and are amazed at how well she looks.
"I say, 'Yes, medications are so much better today -- one pill, once a day,'" she said.
The 5K walk/run May 21 will be held rain or shine and will include entertainment by the steel drum band, Snow Pond Pantastics. Registration is at 9 a.m. at the yurt at Quarry Road Recreation Area, where a breakfast of bagels, cream cheese, doughnuts, fruit and yogurt will be offered.
The walk/run starts at 10 a.m. and the silent auction and cookout will be at noon. Several businesses donated auction items, which include a whitewater rafting trip for two. Clowns and face painting will be featured. Dogs are welcome but must be on leashes.
The event was held on the Hallowell rail trail in the past but outgrew the space and was moved this year to Quarry Road. Mills and Russell said they are excited about it and can't wait to see new faces there.
"We love it -- it's a beautiful space," Mills said.

Texto completo:   SKOWHEGAN -- Noting a stabilization of property taxes at its paper mill in Skowhegan, officials at Sappi North America have released the company's 2015 Sustainability Report with a renewed commitment to keeping jobs in Maine and reducing the company's carbon footprint.
Using the slogan People, Planet and Prosperity the Boston-based company is setting its sustainability goals by investing in the people it employs, making commitments to protect the planet from the wasteful use of natural resources and maintaining a vision to achieve profitable growth and prosperity for current and future generations, according to the report.
The three goals Sappi announced last week lay the groundwork for increasing safety and education for Sappi employees, building financial returns on operations through efficiency and reducing energy and raw material waste.
Some of this past year's performance highlights included in the report include:
[bullet] 100 percent of fiber was purchased in accordance with the Sustainable Forest Initiative's fiber sourcing standard as well as the Forest Stewardship Council's controlled wood standard, and 58 percent of fiber to make paper came from certified sources, those overseen by a land manager and responsible forester.
[bullet] Sappi remains the manufacturer with the lowest carbon footprint out of all domestic producers of coated freesheet papers in the U.S., and the company's combined direct and indirect emissions total just 0.4 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of product.
[bullet] The solid waste sent to landfills reached its lowest level in the past five years, due in large part to the continued expansion of the company's beneficial use program where by-products are used by local landowners as a soil amendment.
[bullet] Achieving high levels of renewable energy as company stakeholders and customers look to global climate change.
A list of the biggest polluters in Maine released in 2014 by the federal Environmental Protection Agency included the Sappi mill in Skowhegan, which was listed third in the state with more than 2 million pounds of toxic chemicals emitted.
The company's Westbrook operation also made the list as the state's eighth-largest polluter with about 257,000 pounds of emissions.
Sappi President and CEO Mark Gardner and Laura Thompson, Sappi director of sustainable development and global policy initiatives, acknowledged the data, noting that reducing toxic emissions is among the top goals of the company.
"Sappi North America is committed to managing our environmental impact in the communities in which we operate," Thompson said in a prepared statement last week. "As one of the largest manufacturers in the state, naturally, our emissions will be higher and we tend to land higher on those lists. However, we are dedicated to implementing internationally recognized environmental management systems and measure our progress, which you can see in our latest 2015 Sustainability Report."
Gardner agreed, noting conversion to energy efficient practices over the past few years to reduce pollutants has led to the reuse of waste byproducts in the paper-making process.
"Over the years, Sappi has invested tens of millions of dollars in pollution control equipment, and we are in full compliance with all relevant federal and state laws with Maine having some of the most stringent laws in the country," Gardner said. "In some cases, we are well ahead of aggressive goals, and in some areas, we will need to dig a little deeper and work harder to achieve our five-year vision."
Nick Bennett, staff scientist at the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said the 2014 list released by the EPA is the most recent data available. The 2015 Toxic Release Inventory report is due out sometime this fall, he said.
Gardner said sustainability goals include:
[bullet] Reducing paper mill and pulp mill raw material waste.
[bullet] Reducing the total amount of energy expended in making each ton of product.
[bullet] Ensuring 60 percent total certified fiber content.
[bullet] Achieving or exceeding 12 percent return on net operating assets.
[bullet] Offering 60 hours of training and education per employee annually to advance through the organization.
[bullet] Achieving zero workplace injuries.
Thompson, Sappi's director of sustainability, said the company also is committed to keeping jobs in Skowhegan. She said the company concentrates on three areas of sustainability -- environmental issues, social issues, including jobs, and economic issues.
"It's a commitment to the long term viability of us as a company," she said by phone last week. "We know we're working on the right things when we're affecting all three of those elements."
Thompson said Sappi is a long-term employer with 813 jobs at the paper mill on U.S. Route 201 in Skowhegan. In South Portland Sappi employs 119 people, the technology center has 49 workers and 328 people work at the Westbrook location.
Thompson said as the workforce ages, sustainability issues are used as a recruiting tool to attract younger people to the paper-making field. She said if people understand how the company is trying to operate responsibly, Sappi can be an employer of choice at all three of its Maine locations.
Thompson noted that the Sappi mill in Skowhegan is a major participant in the community as a taxpayer and an employer. The company and the town reached an agreement in March to cap the value for taxation at the company's paper mill at $380 million. It was a compromise solution to save jobs and put an end to disagreements that had dragged on for months, officials said.
In exchange, Sappi agreed to withdraw its tax abatement requests against the town for 2014 and 2015. The compromise represents an agreed upon $64 million in reduced value for taxation beginning the coming fiscal year. Under the agreement, the town will lose about $1.2 million in taxes for fiscal year 2016-17. In the years following, the town assessors will update the property valuation, but not to exceed $380 million in 2017-18 and 2018-19. No abatement will be sought by Sappi, and there will be no supplemental assessments for taxation by the town, according to the settlement agreement.
Thompson said the company also has what they call sustainability ambassadors, whose members perform community outreach on sustainability. At a recent Earth Day event in Portland, Sappi employees participated in a road race raising money for water sustainability. The ambassadors also participated in a green community day where they had a booth set up to talk about Sappi mills and the company's operations.
"We were doing paper-making demonstrations with little kids and demonstrated the proper way to build a stream crossing in forestry," Thompson said. "That kind of community engagement and showing up in a community as Sappi shows who we are and what we do."
Summing up the 2015 Sustainability Report, Thompson said Sappi has goals to always be reducing waste going into landfills and energy intensity to reduce air emissions, while providing good jobs now and into the future.
"These are things that are both good for the environment and good for us economically," she said. "It helps us be a viable employer for the long term practicing sustainable forestry, making sure that we have more trees tomorrow than we have today."

The report comes as Madison Paper Industries prepares to shut down next week, the fifth paper mill across the state to close in the last two years, a situation that U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King in March called an economic crisis and that King likened to a force of nature.
The three goals Sappi announced last week lay the groundwork for increasing safety and education for Sappi employees, building financial returns on operations through efficiency and reducing energy and raw material waste.

Texto completo:   Boston Police Commissioner William B. Evans completed his 50th marathon Sunday with a run along the Maine coast, meeting a lofty personal goal and raising a question from his wife: Will this marathon be Evans's last?
"Unfortunately for her, probably not," said Boston's 57-year-old top police official. "I like doing it."
Evans said he completed the 26.2-mile Shipyard Maine Coast Marathon in 3 hours and 39 minutes.
"Fifty was special," Evans said. "I'm doing under four hours. . . . That's a pretty good time. I'm keeping up with the young guys."
Evans, who ran in spite of the cold he's been battling, said he managed to squeeze in only a few hours of sleep after attending the Boston Medical Center Gala Saturday. He woke up in the wee hours of Sunday to drive to Maine.
He joined about a thousand other runners for the annual marathon, which started in 1980. On the event's website, organizers highlight the route's scenic views, including five miles in Kennebunk, Kennebunkport, Goose Rocks Beach, and Fortunes Rocks Beach. "The sights were beautiful," Evans said.
Evans said he is already looking for a marathon he can run in the fall. He completed one in Chicago last year.
The commissioner's barber wants him to participate in a marathon in Athens, while Mayor Martin J. Walsh's chief of staff, Dan Koh, has suggested a race in Iceland. Evans mentioned a marathon on Cape Cod, which he says would be easier to get to.
For now, Evans is keeping his focus on running the Boston Police Department.
"I love my job," he said. "I have a great police department, and we're going to stay focused on what we got to do to keep the summer as quiet as we can."

Many partners in a long-term relationship or marriage are able to stay HIV/AIDS-free, even if the other partner is diagnosed with it, through proper education and preventive measures, they said.

Texto completo:   NANCY RUSSELL AND Dennis Mills wrack their brains, trying to figure out why they can't seem to get more people to take part in the 5K walk/run they are organizing to benefit people living with HIV/AIDS in mid-coast and central Maine.
Could it be that they don't advertise it well enough? Or that people are afraid to be affiliated with those who have the disease?
They believe the stigma around HIV/AIDS is still strong, even though people work hard to educate others about the disease which affects people just like you and me.
Mills and Russell are planning the AIDS Walk of Central Maine to be held from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at Quarry Road Recreation Area in Waterville. Hosted by MaineGeneral Medical Center's Horizon Program, which provides medical and social services to people with HIV/AIDS, the money helps clients who need a little extra help with dental work, fuel, security deposits, eye exams, eye glasses and other necessities.
Russell, 72, has had HIV 27 years and is a peer advocate and special events coordinator for the Horizon Program. She says she often hears about walks for domestic violence, breast cancer and other causes where hundreds of people take part and raise up to $30,000.
She dreams of having such a turnout for the AIDS Walk, which has been held six years and each year draws only about 60 or 70 participants. They typically raise a few thousand dollars and while the money is greatly appreciated, she wishes it were more.
"I would definitely love to see more participate, therefore more dollars coming in, because we know it goes to a good cause -- to the clients who really need it," she said. "So many clients have dental needs. Everything is expensive now. Everywhere, funding is being cut. We get federal money, we get some grant money, but the pots keep getting smaller and smaller, so this is one way that we can raise funds, and we'd love to raise more."
Walkers, runners and volunteers -- and more volunteers are needed, she said -- have a wonderful time. They have a cookout, silent auction, entertainment and children's activities in addition to the 5K. Walkers or runners may ask people to help sponsor them by donating money. Participants may donate money themselves. People may sign up by calling Horizon at 621-3785, extension 5, or by going to the website www.give.mainegeneral.org/AIDSWALK. They also may just show up the day of the event to register. The registration fee is $15, but it is waived for those who can not afford to pay it.
Russell, who has raised $2,165 so far herself, spoke about the fundraiser this week while sitting at Mills' kitchen table in Waterville.
They talked about HIV/AIDS and about how medications are so much better than they were many years ago and people are living a long time with the disease. One client in the program has lived with HIV for 33 years, they said.
They spoke about misconceptions around HIV/AIDS and why it is important for children and adults to be educated about it. For instance, one can not contract HIV through sharing
dishes or a toilet or by hugging someone. It is contracted through bodily fluids such as blood or semen or by sharing needles, they said. Many partners in a long-term relationship or marriage are able to stay HIV/AIDS-free, even if the other partner is diagnosed with it, through proper education and preventive measures, they said.
People should get tested for HIV/AIDS if they suspect they could have it, as early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in a person's health, they said.
In Maine there are a little more than 1,800 known cases of HIV/AIDS, and each year 50,000 new cases are diagnosed in the U.S. One in four are women, according to Russell. Anyone can get HIV/AIDS. It is not a gay man's disease as it was once thought to be, according to Russell, who is heterosexual, lives in Waterville and contracted HIV from a one-time encounter with a neighbor in Florida many years ago.
Mills, 61, was diagnosed with HIV six years ago after having worked as a registered nurse 37 years in Maine, Boston and California and working mostly in locked psychiatric units. He said many people who have HIV can not work because of their illness and related physical issues, and it is difficult for them to get dental care beyond the $750 annually they get as part of their disability. Teeth are important because when your teeth are bad, it affects the rest of your body, Mills said.
A Maine native, Mills moved back here from California about a year ago because he could no longer work and the cost of living was too high there. He had been in a long-term relationship with a man, and six years ago they broke up. Afterward, Mills became sick and learned only after the fact that his former partner had HIV but was too terrified to tell him.
Since being diagnosed, Mills has had six heart attacks, but is doing much better now, he said. The first heart attack occurred before he was diagnosed, when his body was being attacked by the virus but he did not know it.
Sadly, Mills knows people whose families have disowned them because they learn they are gay, he said. Mills, who holds a master's degree in theology and health management from Duke University, said he also has spoken with pastors who believe people get HIV/AIDS because they are sinners.
"It's very sad," Russell said in response to his comment.
Neither Mills nor Russell looks sick. In fact, they appear healthy and strong. They said they receive excellent medical care at the Horizon Program, which has a clinic in Gardiner and an office for case management and social services on Green Street in Augusta. The program also offers superb emotional support through groups and social events for the 192 or so clients, 25 of whom are women.
"It's been nothing but a blessing," Mills said of the program. "Everyone is great -- case management, nurses. Everyone who works there is very caring and very compassionate."
Russell said that often new clients are frightened after being diagnosed, and when she tells them she has had HIV 27 years, they look at her and are amazed at how well she looks.
"I say, 'Yes, medications are so much better today -- one pill, once a day,'" she said.
The 5K walk/run May 21 will be held rain or shine and will include entertainment by the steel drum band, Snow Pond Pantastics. Registration is at 9 a.m. at the yurt at Quarry Road Recreation Area, where a breakfast of bagels, cream cheese, doughnuts, fruit and yogurt will be offered. The walk/run starts at 10 a.m. and the silent auction and cookout will be at noon. Several businesses donated auction items, which include a whitewater rafting trip for two. Clowns and face painting will be featured. Dogs are welcome but must be on leashes.
The event was held on the Hallowell rail trail in the past but outgrew the space and was moved this year to Quarry Road. Mills and Russell said they are excited about it and can't wait to see new faces there.
"We love it -- it's a beautiful space," Mills said.

Texto completo:   plan for a craft distellery in Gardiner
GARDINER -- When Dave Tomer describes what he and his partners are doing to get their business up and running, one thing becomes abundantly clear: You can't start a distillery by accident.
Tomer is one of the partners behind the Sebago Lake Distillery, which is seeking a federal job creation grant to help get the craft distilling business launched in Gardiner.
On Wednesday, the Gardiner City Council authorized federal workforce training and job creation grant applications to be submitted on behalf of Sebago Lake Distillery, as well as Commonwealth Poultry and Central Maine Meats.
With the $90,000 being sought through the Community Development Block Grant program, the distillery plans to create three jobs, and it would be able to do it far sooner than it otherwise could.
"It's very much a chicken-and-egg process," Tomer said last week. "You can't get a license for a distillery without a facility, and you can't get a facility without capital."
What that means is that Sebago Lake Distillery has to secure everything it needs before it can receive its license, and only then can it produce the first drop of spirits.
The outlay is enormous. Tomer and his partners have signed a five-year lease on 463 Water St., the former Water Street Grill building. They have ordered the still, which could take six months to build and is expected to cost more than $100,000. That doesn't include the boiler required to heat the still, and that can run between $40,000 and $50,000. Then there's the cost of ingredients and bottling.
"Then you need employees, so any type of grant or loan you can get in advance is helpful," he said.
Putting this all together, he said, including meeting the federal and state license requirements, is a daunting task.
But he and his partners - who have collaborated with him on other business ventures - think the risk is well worth taking.
"The craft distilling business is where the craft brewery business was 15 years ago," he said. He thinks there is the same potential for growth and market development.
When it came to finding a home for the distillery, the partners considered buildings in several central Maine locations, but settled on Gardiner.
"Gardiner has been phenomenal," he said. "A lot of towns and cities don't have foresight and haven't committed economic development people. It's easier when you have a champion."
Dan Davis, who is the master distiller in the enterprise, is familiar with southern Kennebec County, he said. They knew that the Gardiner/Hallowell area is considered up and coming and that tourists like it.
"It's a cool area," he said, and he considers that spirits, particularly those made in a Maine-made still with Maine-sourced ingredients, will compliment Gardiner's food hub identity.
"We hope to have a tasting room and be able to pair our spirits with meats and cheeses," he said. "We see the need and the desire to have that there."
Patrick Wright, who is the economic development coordinator for Gardiner, said a convergence is emerging in Gardiner.
"Businesses are recognizing what a fertile place Gardiner is for opportunity, and the city is getting a lot more comfortable with the CDBG program," he said. "The growth in craft/local food and beverage is an intentional component of our economic development strategy, and we are happy to be able to support these hard-working entrepreneurs."
