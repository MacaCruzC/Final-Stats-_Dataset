KABUL, Afghanistan — Rifle fire, hurried footsteps and distant explosions. The rat-a-tat of a firefight. Cars mangled from grenades. The young man was transfixed.
It could have been any day in Kabul, where targeted assassinations, terrorist attacks and wanton violence have become routine, and the city often feels as if it is under siege. But for Safiullah Sharifi, his behind firmly planted on a dusty stoop in the Qala-e Fatullah neighborhood, the death and destruction unfurled on his phone, held landscape-style in his hands.
“On Friday I play from early morning to around 4 p.m.,” said Sharifi, 20, with a sly grin, as if he knew he was detailing the outline of an addiction to a passerby. His left hand is tattooed with a skull in a jester’s hat, a grim image offset by his lanky and not-quite-old-enough demeanor. “Almost every night, it’s 8 p.m. to 3 a.m.”
The game is called PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds, but to its millions of players worldwide, no matter the language, it’s referred to as PUBG (pronounced pub-gee). It’s violent. And it’s becoming widely played across Afghanistan, almost as an escape from reality as the 19-year-old war grinds on.
In the game, the player drops onto a large piece of terrain, finds weapons and equipment and kills everyone, all of whom are other people playing the game against each other. Victory translates to being the last person or team standing. Which makes its growing popularity in Afghanistan peculiar since that can eerily almost describe the state of the war — despite ongoing peace negotiations in Qatar.
Even as ending that war seems ever more elusive, Afghan lawmakers are trying to ban PUBG, arguing that it promotes violence and distracts the young from their schoolwork.
But Sharifi laughed at the mention of the proposed ban, knowing he could circumvent it easily with software on his phone.
He said he uses the game to communicate with friends and sometimes talks to girls who also play it. That is a remarkable feat on its own since only in the last several years have Afghanistan’s cell networks become capable of delivering the kind of data needed to play a game like PUBG, let alone communicate with people concurrently.
Gaming centers became popular in Kabul in the years after the 2001 U.S. invasion, which reversed the Taliban’s ban on entertainment including video games and music. But PUBG and other mobile games are usurping these staples because they are downloadable on a smartphone, and free, in a country where 90% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Sometimes, players pay a local vendor to download the game, a workaround to avoid taxing limited and sometimes expensive data plans for phones. That costs as little as 60 cents.
Abdul Habib, 27, runs a video gaming den in West Kabul that features mostly soccer games. It’s a closet-size room on the lower floor of a shopping center, with TVs, couches and Playstations.
There are other gaming dens in the shopping center, separated by doorways and different owners, but connected by neon lights and a dimly lit atrium where youths scurry back and forth looking for couch space and controllers. A snack stand sells sausage sandwiches.
“If you can’t fight in the real war, you can do it virtually,” Habib said of violent video games, including PUBG.
Habib has rented his den for four years; usually about 100 people a day come through. The mix of children, teenagers, parents and assorted adults pay around 65 cents to play for an hour. But his business was hit hard in the first months of the coronavirus pandemic when he — and dozens of other Kabul gaming dens — shut down for two months. That’s when the fixation on PUBG took off.
Now its popularity is cutting into Habib’s business and that of others in the industry.
Abdullah Popalzai, 20, has his own game center across the street from Sharifi’s house. It’s a little shop, with garage-roller doors, a generator, four TVs, four Playstations and an aging foosball table.
“I used to earn 800 afs a day,” Popalzai said. That is about $10. “Now I barely have enough to get bread and food for the family.”
Mohammad Ali sees PUBG as an escape. Leaning outside Habib’s den, Ali, 23, pointed to the headphones around his neck, bought specifically to play PUBG so he can disappear in the game with his friends.
“I get so busy with the game I forget about the world,” he said. “It distracts me from the city, the attacks, the robberies, the thieves and the crime.”
The website PlayerCounter puts PUBG’s total at around 400 million players worldwide since its release in 2017, on phones, computers and video game consoles. But aside from anecdotal evidence, it’s hard to say how many Afghans play. The game’s developer did not respond to an inquiry regarding the number of players in the country.
Anticipating a possible ban of the game by the Afghan government, a major cellphone provider tried to figure out how much its network would be affected.
The company, said one official, restricted access to the game just after midnight one day, and subsequently lost 50% of its network’s data traffic. The official reckoned that more than 100,000 people were playing the game across the country at the time.
PUBG is not the first form of entertainment to draw ire from the Afghan government. In 2008, several Turkish soap operas were taken off air because they did not align with “Afghan religion and culture.”
Wedged between the once oppressive Taliban regime of the 1990s and the growth of the internet and social media in the 21st century, Afghanistan’s government has long walked a thin line — trying to balance its religiously conservative population with democratic freedoms.
For Mohammad Akbar Sultanzada, chair of the Afghan Parliament’s Transportation and Telecommunications Commission, the problem with PUBG is not just its violence. He said it has also invaded the country’s already strained, frequently threatened and understaffed classrooms. PUBG was banned in Iraq last year for similar reasons.
“It can be really negative for children’s mental health,” said Freshta Karim, director of Charmaghz, a Kabul nonprofit, and a local education activist. “I feel like it encourages and normalizes violence and makes them a part of it.”
Outside influences, including in education, are often disparaged among Afghans but high levels of illiteracy have left the population vulnerable to just that. In the 1980s, the U.S. distributed millions of textbooks to Afghan children that promoted violence through text and images that featured talks of jihad and weapons of war as ways to help learn the alphabet and basic math.
But PUBG is not handed out in classrooms; it’s played under desks and in courtyards and, when some children skip school, on street corners. If the game is banned, many people say, they will just turn to virtual private networks and keep playing.
“If they don’t want people to be violent,” said Habib, the owner of the video gaming den, “they should stop the war on the battlefield.”

BOZEMAN, Mont. — The Madison River rushes down out of the snows and springs atop the Yellowstone plateau, a dark blue, rock-studded, world-class fishing stream.
The fishing season is nearly finished, but a season of discontent continues. Throughout the summer and fall, there have been traffic jams on the river, and the number of large fish has declined.
“You’re in a flotilla with five boats in front of you and five in back of you,” said Carl Hamming, a board member of a local chapter of Trout Unlimited, which wants to limit commercial guides on the river. “It seems like everyone was flocking to Montana this summer,” he said.
Some say floating the jammed river feels like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland; a writer in a Montana wilderness journal recently coined another name for it: “Rivergeddon.”
After a series of contentious meetings, the Montana Department of Fish Wildlife and Parks on Wednesday approved a series of measures to ease the effects of crowds on the Madison River, including a cap on the number of guided fishing and rafting trips, though critics say the changes will not do much.
The phenomenon of gridlock in a natural paradise has been seen across the West for years. But in Montana it has accelerated markedly this year, fueled by urbanites fleeing the pandemic. Now, many residents are concerned that the state that calls itself the Last Best Place has bragged a little too loudly and too often.
Much of the ire is focused in Bozeman and environs, some 80 miles north of Yellowstone National Park. Once a small college and ranching town, the past couple of decades have seen it explode with people who have come for the fishing, hiking, skiing and other outdoor amenities. The city, which has about 50,000 residents now, is forecast to add another 27,000 people by 2045 and far more if surrounding areas are taken into account.
Housing prices have soared, especially this year, driven by COVID refugees who sometimes buy a home without seeing it. In one month this summer, the median home price jumped by $88,000 to $584,000 — in a city where the average annual wage is about $48,000. Home prices jumped another $35,000 just last month. Even as the Tyvek and two-by-fours of new construction have become ubiquitous, many local residents say they are getting priced out of the market.
The situation has been worsened by the proliferation of short-term rentals to satisfy demand created by out-of-town visitors.
“The pandemic has exacerbated it,” said Bozeman’s mayor, Cyndy Andrus. “We’ve been growing a lot, but it took off this year. They are fleeing big urban areas for the amenities.”
For some residents the biggest blow is the whittling away of their “psychic income.” Many people are willing to make less money in exchange for living in a wild place with uncrowded hiking, fishing, and skiing.
That equation has changed dramatically this year, as people flee confinement for the great outdoors — and that includes both new transplants from coronavirus hot spots and local residents who are opting to spend more time outdoors during the pandemic.
Yellowstone Park did not fully open until June 1 because of the coronavirus, and much of the park’s lodging was closed, but this August was the second busiest on record. September and October also saw record crowds for those months.
Meanwhile, many residents complain of crowds swarming at trailhead parking lots, camping along roads in national forests, overloading rivers and fly fishing spots. “This is the No. 1 topic of discussion,” said Dennis Glick, the director of a Bozeman nonprofit called Future West, which helps communities with sustainable planning. “Everybody is complaining about how crowded campgrounds and trails are.”
At Bangtail Bike and Ski, a mountain bike and Nordic skiing store, sales are through the roof. “I sold five times the number of cross-country skis in September and October this year as last year,” said Robert Funderburk, the manager. He said that a shortage of skis and mountain bikes nationally has prompted people to come in and “panic buy” their outdoor gear. “I call it the toilet paper effect. People know there is a shortage and they just buy it.”
But the cramping of recreational pursuits is just one dimension. The Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, which takes in more than 34,000 square miles of wildland around Yellowstone National Park and includes the cities of Bozeman and Jackson, Wyoming, is considered the largest nearly intact temperate ecosystem in the world.
It is one of the few places in the continental United States where landscape-level ecological processes can play out, including wolf packs hunting elk and deer, long-distance wildlife migrations and wildfires that can be left to burn in order to rejuvenate the natural landscape.
But the mounting human population, exacerbated by the pandemic but increasing over a period of years, has threatened all of those natural processes. “We are going to lose the greatest wildlife-rich ecosystem remaining unless we chart an alternative path,” said Todd Wilkinson, editor of Mountain Journal, an online magazine that has warned of poorly managed growth and the arrival of “Rivergeddon.”
“Other places like this no longer have wildlife because the landscape has been so fragmented,” Wilkinson said.
Snowmobiles and backcountry skiing are encroaching into the denning areas of wolverines. A recent study in British Columbia found that the presence of people in wildlife habitat, especially those on mountain bikes and off-road vehicles, can force animals to flee important feeding areas.
The Madison River provides a case in point for the steady escalation of recreational traffic to what was once a pristine river.
In 2008 there were about 6,600 commercially guided fishing trips on the river. Last year, there were more than 14,000.
That has led to parking lots filled with truck and boat trailers and lots of trash on the riverbanks.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Kirk Deeter, a former guide and head of communications for Trout Unlimited in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, another outdoor destination that has experienced similar growth during the pandemic. “With no T-ball leagues or theaters or malls, people found the rivers and lakes in droves. It’s a circus out there.”
The environmental damage already is obvious, he said. “The rivers are getting the living snot pounded out of them everyday.”
Montana has seen an average of 1,232 new cases a day of the coronavirus over the past week, an increase of 40% over the previous two weeks, and many longtime residents have blamed the newcomers for bringing the virus with them — though Gov. Steve Bullock has said there is no evidence of that.
And the push to make way for newcomers goes on.
The recreation communities to the west of Yellowstone have also boomed, with the latest addition a $416 million, 520,000-square-foot lodge at the Montage Big Sky “ultra luxury” resort. It lies not far from a new 500,000-square-foot lodge at the high-end Yellowstone Club — designed, promotional materials say, “to respect the West.”
Glick, the advocate for sustainable planning, said that tourism and the growth of real estate, tech and service industries have been promoted as better alternatives to the damaging effects of mining and logging, Montana’s former mainstays. But they need to be studied and carefully managed, which is not now the case, he said.
“Conservationists touted recreation as the benign alternative to resource extractions,” he said. “It’s a tough pill to swallow that the alternative they have been promoting has become a significant environmental issue.”
Andrus, the Bozeman mayor, said it “may be time to dial down the tourism promotion” and reallocate some of the money to compensate for the effects of a large number of visitors. But shutting the door is not the solution, she said.
“Closing the state down to visitors is not practical; even if it was, I don’t believe it is a good idea,” she said. “You cannot put that genie back in the bottle.”

Biden Will Nominate First Woman to Lead Intelligence, First Latino to Run Homeland Security

WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden plans to name several top national security picks Tuesday, his transition office said, including the first Latino to lead the Department of Homeland Security, the first woman to head the intelligence community and a former secretary of state, John Kerry, to be his climate czar.
At an event in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden will announce plans to nominate Alejandro Mayorkas to be his secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, his transition office said, and Avril Haines to be his director of national intelligence. He intends to name Kerry as a special presidential envoy on climate. The transition office also confirmed reports Sunday night that Biden will nominate Antony J. Blinken to be secretary of state and Jake Sullivan as national security adviser.
Biden will also nominate Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be ambassador to the United Nations and restore the job to Cabinet-level status, giving Thomas-Greenfield, an African American woman, a seat on his National Security Council. Kerry will also be given a seat on the council, although his job is not a Cabinet position and does not require Senate confirmation.
The emerging team reunites a group of former senior officials from the Obama administration, most of whom worked closely together at the State Department and the White House and in several cases have close ties to Biden dating back years. They are well known to foreign diplomats around the world and share a belief in the core principles of the Democratic foreign policy establishment — international cooperation, strong U.S. alliances and leadership but a wariness of foreign interventions after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The racial and gender mix also reflects Biden’s stated commitment to diversity, which has lagged behind notoriously in the worlds of foreign policy and national security, where white men are disproportionately represented.
The slate of picks also showed Biden’s determination to push forward with setting up his administration despite President Donald Trump’s continuing refusal to concede or assist him, even as a small but growing number of Republicans lawmakers and supporters of the president are calling for a formal transition to begin.
If confirmed, Mayorkas, who served as deputy Homeland Security secretary from 2013 to 2016, would be the first Latino to run the department charged with implementing and managing the nation’s immigration policies.
A Cuban-born immigrant whose family fled the Castro revolution, he is a former U.S. attorney in California and began President Barack Obama’s first term as director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. He will have to restore trust in the department after many key Democratic constituencies came to see it as the vessel for some of Trump’s most contentious policies, such as separating migrant children from their families and building a wall along the southern border.
Top immigration officials in the Obama administration recommended Mayorkas’ nomination as a way to build support with the immigrant community while satisfying moderates and career officials within the agency who are looking for a leader with a background in law enforcement.
Haines served as deputy CIA director in the Obama administration before succeeding Blinken as Obama’s deputy national security adviser. She, too, is a former aide to Biden, serving as deputy chief counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2007 to 2008 while Biden was chairman. Haines also served as counsel to Obama’s National Security Council, helping him navigate legal issues around counterterrorism operations and pressing for more restraint to reduce civilian casualties.
If confirmed, Haines will be the highest-ranking woman to serve in the intelligence community. The CIA director, now led by its first female director in Gina Haspel, reports to the director of national intelligence.
Thomas-Greenfield is a 35-year Foreign Service veteran who has served in diplomatic posts around the world. She served from 2013 to 2017 as assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Just as important in the view of Biden officials is her time as a former director general and human resources director of the Foreign Service; they see it as positioning her to help restore morale at a State Department where many career officials felt ignored and even undermined during the Trump years.
Thomas-Greenfield, who recently recounted joining a “still very male and very pale” foreign service decades ago, has also served as the U.S. ambassador to Liberia and has been posted in Switzerland, Pakistan, Kenya, Gambia, Nigeria and Jamaica.
Perhaps the biggest surprise was Biden’s decision to bring back Kerry in a new role that would signal the new administration’s commitment to fighting climate change. Kerry, 76, is a former, longtime Senate colleague and friend who campaigned for Biden through some of his candidacy’s darkest days and, Democrats say, retains his voracious appetite for international affairs.
Since serving as Obama’s second secretary of state from 2013 to 2017, Kerry elevated his longtime interest in climate to his signature issue and currently runs an organization dedicated to the topic. His will be a full-time position.
“We have no time to lose when it comes to our national security and foreign policy,” Biden said in a statement provided by his transition office. “I need a team ready on Day 1 to help me reclaim America’s seat at the head of the table, rally the world to meet the biggest challenges we face, and advance our security, prosperity, and values. This is the crux of that team.”
“These individuals are equally as experienced and crisis-tested as they are innovative and imaginative” he added. “Their accomplishments in diplomacy are unmatched, but they also reflect the idea that we cannot meet the profound challenges of this new moment with old thinking and unchanged habits — or without diversity of background and perspective. It’s why I’ve selected them.”
In Blinken, 58, Biden chose a confidant of more than 20 years who served as his top aide on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before joining his vice-presidential staff, where he served as Biden’s national security adviser, then principal deputy national security adviser to Obama and then deputy secretary of state from 2015 to 2017.
Blinken is widely viewed as a pragmatic centrist on foreign policy who, like Biden, has supported past U.S. interventions and believes that the United States must play a central leadership role in the world. Biden likely calculated that the soft-spoken Blinken, who is well regarded by many Republicans, will face a less difficult Senate confirmation fight than another top contender, former national security adviser Susan E. Rice.
Blinken began his career at the State Department during the Clinton administration. He spent much of his youth in Paris and attended high school there, and is a graduate of Harvard University and Columbia Law School.
Sullivan will take the White House’s top national security job and, at 44 when he takes office, will be the youngest person to hold that position after McGeorge Bundy, who took over the job at age 41 under President John F. Kennedy.
Long viewed as one of his party’s brightest upcoming talents, Sullivan followed Blinken as Biden’s top national security aide and then ascended to become a senior aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has called him a “once-in-a-generation talent.” Along the way, Sullivan found admirers even among conservative Republicans in Congress while playing a key role in the negotiations leading to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
A Minnesota native and Yale Law School graduate, Sullivan in recent months has helped spearhead a project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reconceiving U.S. foreign policy around the needs of the American middle class.

Concerned that President Donald Trump’s refusal to accept the election results is hurting the country, more than 160 top American executives asked the administration on Monday to immediately acknowledge Joe Biden as the president-elect and begin the transition to a new administration.
Even one of Trump’s stalwart supporters, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone, the private equity firm, said in a statement that “the outcome is very certain today and the country should move on.” While he did not sign a letter sent to the administration by the other executives, he said he was “now ready to help President-elect Biden and his team.”
Signatories to the letter included the chief executives of Mastercard, Visa, MetLife, Accenture, the Carlyle Group, Condé Nast, McGraw-Hill, WeWork and American International Group, among others. They included some of the most important players in the financial industry: David M. Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs; Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of the asset management giant BlackRock; Jon Gray, Blackstone’s president; and Henry R. Kravis, a prominent Republican donor who is the co-chief executive of KKR, a private equity firm.
The letter was also signed by George H. Walker, the chief executive of the money manager Neuberger Berman and a second cousin to President George W. Bush, and Jeff T. Blau, the chief executive of one of New York City’s largest private developers, the Related Cos., who has been a major donor to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, filings show.
As a way of gaining leverage over the GOP, some of the executives have also discussed withholding campaign donations from the two Republican Senate candidates in Georgia unless party leaders agree to push for a presidential transition, according to four people who participated in a conference call Friday in which the notion was discussed. The two runoff elections in Georgia, which will take place in early January, will determine the balance of power in the U.S. Senate.
In the letter sent Monday, the business leaders demanded that Emily W. Murphy, head of the General Services Administration, issue a letter of ascertainment affirming that Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris had won the election. Murphy has so far resisted calls to begin the normal transition planning, which includes providing resources and money to an incoming administration as it prepares to take control.
“Every day that an orderly presidential transition process is delayed, our democracy grows weaker in the eyes of our own citizens and the nation’s stature on the global stage is diminished,” the executives wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times. “Withholding resources and vital information from an incoming administration puts the public and economic health and security of America at risk.”
The initiative comes as Trump has refused to acknowledge Biden as the winner, subverted the nation’s electoral process with unfounded claims of fraud, and put pressure on state Republicans to try to impede certification of the results.
The Friday evening executive call, which included a group of about a dozen business leaders, was preceded by a meeting of Democratic state attorneys general that took place on Thursday evening, in which participants discussed what they could do to ensure an orderly transition. In the wake of that, New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, was asked to approach business leaders in her jurisdiction about the possibility of pushing the stalled transition into motion.
“She said they asked her to reach out to the New York business community,” Kathryn Wylde, the chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, said of James. Wylde took part in a call the next evening with James and the executives, who were donors to both political parties.
Wylde said James told the group that the attorneys general “thought that the New York business community” would “have influence in convincing Republicans around the country that this should be over, that the transition should be acknowledged, and that it was a frightening proposition that this would remain unresolved.”
James, in a statement Sunday night, said, “This isn’t about partisan politics, but about protecting our democracy.”
“Without the rule of law and an orderly transfer of power, everything from commerce to health care delivery to national security is in peril, and our business leaders can see that as clearly as the rest of us,” she added.
Among the topics that came up on the call, according to participants, was the idea of withholding support from Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, both Republicans, who are running for reelection in Georgia, until the presidential transition is underway.
At least one participant, Rob Speyer, the chief executive of Tishman Speyer, suggested that some wealthy donors had already been considering withholding support, according to four people with knowledge of his comments. Business leaders, along with a number of other Americans, are increasingly worried that delays in the typical transition planning will exacerbate the pandemic and slow plans to roll out vaccines.
Schwarzman, in his statement, said: “I supported President Trump and the strong economic path he built. Like many in the business community, I am now ready to help President-elect Biden and his team as they confront the significant challenges of rebuilding our post-COVID economy.”
The Partnership for New York City, which focuses on economic growth in the metropolitan area, has spent much of the year helping its members navigate the health and economic challenges of the pandemic.
“We urge respect for the democratic process and unified support for our duly elected leadership,” the group said in its letter. “There is not a moment to waste in the battle against the pandemic and for the recovery and healing of our nation to begin.”

Guitar Center Chain Files For Bankruptcy Protection

Texto completo: The filing by the nation's largest retailer of musical instruments highlights the growing gap between the strongest and weakest companies in the pandemic.
Guitar Center, the country's largest retailer of musical instruments, filed for bankruptcy protection late Saturday night.
The company, which was struggling to compete against online rivals even before the pandemic, was hit hard when it was forced to temporarily close most of its stores earlier this year.
It entered Chapter 11 restructuring proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Eastern District of Virginia. It will continue to pay its vendors and employees in full, it said in a news release.
Guitar Center said it had struck an agreement with its creditors in support of a plan that would reduce its roughly $ 1.3 billion in debt by $ 800 million. To help support its bankruptcy, it said it had secured new financing from investors that include a fund managed by its current owner, the private equity firm Ares Management Corporation, as well as funds managed by the hedge fund Brigade Capital Management and the Carlyle Group, also a private equity firm.
The company said it expected to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of the year.
"This is an important and positive step in our process to significantly reduce our debt and enhance our ability to reinvest in our business to support long-term growth," Guitar Center's chief executive, Ron Japinga, said in a statement.
Guitar Center's bankruptcy is the latest example of how the coronavirus pandemic has divided American retail into two groups, with a growing gap between the strongest and weakest companies. Although many people turned to hobbies like playing music while homebound, the beneficiaries of that surge in demand have primarily been businesses with strong e-commerce infrastructure.
Even before the pandemic, Guitar Center's business was threatened by online rivals like the website Sweetwater, and the company was heavily indebted as a result of a private-equity led buyout years earlier. Still, it said in a court filing, it had had 10 consecutive quarters of sales growth through the end of February. But, it said, the pandemic "wiped out much" of that progress. It missed an interest payment of roughly $ 45 million last month, putting it on the path to a bankruptcy filing, The New York Times previously reported.
Guitar Center had to close many of its stores across the country, with 75 percent of its stores shuttered at one point. The retailer later said that online sales blossomed during the pandemic, but what proportion of its business those sales made up is unclear.
It said in the court filing that its "significant debt burden and upcoming maturities, coupled with the economic upheaval created by the persistence of the Covid-19 pandemic, could not be resolved through short-term measures."
Guitar Center's origins date back to 1959, when its founder, Wayne Mitchell, bought a home organ store, the Organ Center. The rise of the Beatles a few years later helped persuade Mr. Mitchell to begin selling guitars and rename the business Guitar Center. The next few decades brought expansion and, in 1997, an initial public offering of stock.
The company was acquired by Bain Capital, the private equity firm, in 2007 for $ 1.9 billion. But, like many such deals, the buyout left Guitar Center heavily indebted just as online rivals began to emerge. To reduce the debt load, some of Guitar Center's debt was converted to equity, making Ares Management the majority shareholder in 2014.
Even so, Guitar Center continued to carry about $ 1.3 billion in debt as a vestige of the Bain takeover.
In filing for bankruptcy, Guitar Center joins a slew of other struggling retailers, including J. Crew, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney, which were unable to withstand the impact of the downturn during the pandemic. Some, like Neiman Marcus, have already emerged from bankruptcy protection.

Vandalizing Our Democracy

Texto completo: Donald Trump cares about nothing else except undermining our country's election results.
On Bill Clinton's Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1993, he found on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway desk in the Oval Office a gracious, handwritten letter left for him by the Republican president whom he had defeated.
In it, the departing president reminded the arriving one:
"You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you. Good Luck -- George."
In reflecting on how meaningful that letter had been to him, Clinton wrote of George H.W. Bush that "though he could be tough in a political fight, he was in it for the right reasons: People always came before politics, patriotism before partisanship."
That is why it was somewhat embarrassing that some members of the Clinton administration committed silly, immature acts of vandalism when handing the reins of power over to Bush's son, George W. Bush, in 2001.
The General Accounting Office investigated the vandalism for a year and concluded that "damage, theft, vandalism and pranks did occur in the White House complex" during the transition, and as The New York Times reported: "The agency put the cost at $ 13,000 to $ 14,000, including $ 4,850 to replace computer keyboards, many with damaged or missing W keys."
It was embarrassing, but not truly disruptive to the transfer of power. Still, Republicans pointed to it as an extreme breach of protocol. Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, who had asked the G.A.O. to look into the allegations of vandalism, said of the findings: "The Clinton administration treated the White House worse than college freshmen checking out of their dorm rooms." He continued, "They disgraced not just themselves but the institution and the office of the presidency as well."
I have thought about the grace of the elder Bush's transition letter and the smallness of the Clinton White House's shenanigans often in recent weeks as we have watched Donald Trump stubbornly refuse to concede, brazenly try to disenfranchise millions of voters and recklessly sow distrust in our electoral system, and by extension our democracy. Everything that happened before has been rendered quaint.
The way Trump has absolutely trashed our democratic norms has made a mockery of things that used to raise our, or at least Republicans', hackles about decorum and propriety -- like Obama not wearing a flag pin, putting his feet on a desk, or wearing a tan suit. Republicans have either cheered or shrunk in silence as Trump has set his blazes and fanned the flames.
The damage Trump is now doing trying to claw back an election that he has lost is almost incalculable in its scope and yet-to-unfold possibilities. There is no guarantee that Trump will ever concede, and there is every suggestion that he won't. There is no way to know what a Biden Inauguration Day would look like. Would Trump attend? Would he gracefully exit the White House premises?
Furthermore, the damage Trump has attempted to do to faith in the American election system has been wildly, depressingly, successful. A Politico/Morning Consult poll earlier this month found that "70 percent of Republicans now say they don't believe the 2020 election was free and fair, a stark rise from the 35 percent of G.O.P. voters who held similar beliefs before the election."
That would represent tens of millions of Americans who, largely because of Trump and the far-right press that abets him, will see a duly elected Joe Biden presidency as illegitimate, and the election system as flawed.
Furthermore, we have a president who appears to care about nothing else but turning his loss into a win, and, if he fails, handicapping the Biden administration.
He has essentially given up fighting the Covid crisis -- other than touting vaccines -- even though the virus is raging in this country and around the world. On Saturday, Trump skipped the "Pandemic Preparedness" meeting of G-20 leaders to play golf. As The Times reported, "at least 1,428 new coronavirus deaths and 171,980 new cases were reported in the United States" on Saturday.
Not only that, but as food insecurity triples for families with children during the Covid-19 pandemic, food bank lines stretch ahead of the holiday, and with 12 million Americans scheduled to lose unemployment benefits the day after Christmas, Trump is not pressuring congressional leaders to pass another aid package.
Remember that it was Trump who used a tweet to halt stimulus talks in early October, writing: "I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business."
He didn't win, and now he could care less. There is golf to be played. Trump is hurt but not humble. He is angry and lashing out.
I wish that all he and his team were doing was removing some B's and H's from some keyboards. Instead, they're taking a sledgehammer to a young and fragile democratic experiment and allowing Americans to suffer and die as they do it.

Why the Black Press still matters

Texto completo: A few years ago, I participated in a panel discussion at Temple University's School of Media and Communication called "Separate But Equal? The Role of the Black Media in the 21st Century."
As the managing editor of the Philadelphia Tribune, the oldest continuously published African American-owned newspaper in the United States, I argue that there is a continuing need for the Black Press.
Mainstream media cover African-American exceptions well enough - the criminals and celebrities and sometimes local African-American politicians. However, we still need the Black Press not only to continue its traditional role as an advocate for social justice but also to show ordinary, hard-working, law-abiding African Americans and the rich culture of Black America.
I will cite three recent examples of why there is a need for the Black Press and more African-American journalists in decision-making roles in mainstream newsrooms.
In June, Philadelphia magazine editor Tom McGrath joined a list of media executives including Inquirer executive editor Stan Wischnowski and New York Times editorial page editor James Bennet who left their posts amid the protests and national reckoning over systemic racism that has gripped the nation since the May 25 killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.
McGrath was in charge when the magazine stirred outrage with a 2013 cover story titled "Being White in Philly" that was widely denounced as racist. "Being White in Philly" became a national story after the magazine was condemned by many, including white writers on the magazine's staff, members of Philadelphia City Council and even Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, who called the story the reckless equivalent of shouting "Fire!" in a crowded theater.
In a letter to the Philadelphia Human Relations Commission, Nutter said the article had a "disgusting" tone and criticized its "collection of disparaging beliefs and negative stereotypes." The mayor correctly pointed out that the story "used isolated negative experiences" and made generalizations to portray African Americans as lazy, irresponsible and criminal.
McGrath was also in charge again in 2015 when Philadelphia magazine ran a cover image without any Black students onaguideto city schools. Both times, after community criticism, McGrath pledged to diversify the magazine's staff.
In a memo to employees, McGrath said his resignation was partly a personal decision and partly an attempt to bring about change. The resignation followed a newsroom-wide teleconference about diversity at the magazine after tweets from former senior editor Fabiola Cineas called out the company's inaction on improving diversity.
The magazine's editorial staff called on its parent company, Metrocorp, to enact a plan to hire and retain employees of color, diversify leadership, audit past coverage, and represent Black Philadelphians in coverage.
The magazine "has not taken sufficient action as a publication to combat systemic racism at large, or racism on our own staff, which has resulted in Black staffers facing microaggressions on a frequent basis," said a memo signed by 26 staffers representing the entire editorial department and some contributors.
Cineas, the former senior editor, who is Black, said that after her June 11 tweet thread about the magazine's lack of diversity, she heard from more than a dozen current or former staffers, interns and fellows who said they had had similar frustrations but had often been afraid to speak up.
In the virtual meeting after Cineas' tweets, McGrath "acknowledged that the magazine has a racist history and has not taken the necessary steps to remedy that fact," the editorial staffers wrote in their memo.
Cineas, who joined the magazine in 2016, said it could be an uncomfortable environment for Black employees, who felt responsible for reading content before publication "to make sure what was written wasn't racist," because "the editors who were higher up often did not have the kind of context they needed to be able to write or talk about issues related to the Black community."
In that same month, The Philadelphia Inquirer had to apologize for a "horribly wrong" decision to use the headline, "Buildings Matter, Too," on a column about looting and vandalism on the margins of protests of George Floyd's death.
About 30 members of the Inquirer's 210-member editorial staff called in sick after the headline appeared, and Black staff members angrily condemned the headline. It appeared over an article by architecture critic Inga Saffron, who worried that buildings damaged in violence could "leave a gaping hole in the heart of Philadelphia."
The Inquirer replaced that headline online with one that read, "Black Lives Matter. Do Buildings?" Eventually, the newspaper settled on "Damaging buildings disproportionately hurt the people protesters are trying to uplift."
The newspaper published an apology from senior editors. Publisher and CEO Lisa Hughes said in a memo to staff that the headline was "offensive and inappropriate" and said the newspaper needed a more diverse workforce.
Immediately after the uproar over the headline, the Inquirer's top editor, Stan Wischnowski, 58, resigned as senior vice president and executive editor.
The backlash at the Inquirer came as The New York Times was widely criticized for publishing an opinion piece by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton advocating the use of federal troops to quell the protests. The Times editorial page editor, James Bennet, resigned after the newspaper disowned the piece.
Cotton's piece was reckless, starting with the headline, "Send in the Troops," which the newspaper later acknowledged in an editor's note was "incendiary and should not have been used."
The fallout was swift after Cotton's piece was posted online. It caused a revolt among Times journalists, with some saying it endangered Black employees who called out sick in protest.
The racial insensitivity of these top editors at Philadelphia magazine, the Philadelphia Inquirer and the New York Times, major liberal-leaning publications, clearly illustrates that although there have been some changes, many of the problems pointed out by the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission, still remain.
President Lyndon B. Johnson established the Kerner Commission in an executive order to investigate the causes of the 1967 riots and to provide recommendations for the future.
The 426-page report released after seven months of investigation said the riots resulted from Black Americans' frustration at a lack of economic opportunity and being the victims of police brutality.
In addition to criticizing federal and state governments for failing in housing, education and social service policies, the commission also gave a scathing report on whiteowned media.
"The press has too long basked in a white world looking out of it, if at all, with white men's eyes and a white perspective."
The Kerner Commission recommended more Black journalists to provide a more accurate perspective of the news.
More than 50 years later, Black Americans still tend to be underrepresented in U.S. newsrooms. While 7% of newsroom employees are Black, 11% of U.S. workers overall are Black, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of20132017 American Community Survey data. There is slightly more proportional representation in local TV newsrooms, with the Radio Television Digital News Association Ånding in 2018 that 12% of those workers are African American. However, only 6% of news directors - the leaders of such newsrooms - are Black, up from 2% in 1995, according to the report.
The recent examples of racial insensitivity at Philadelphia magazine, the Inquirer and the Times demonstrate that the findings of the Kerner Commission are still relevant: We still need Blackowned media and Black American journalists in leadership roles in the mainstream press, and all Americans deserve a more diverse and balanced mainstream media. It should be noted that the editors who resigned because of careless racial insensitivity were experienced, award-winning journalists leading publications in large, diverse cities.
We need the Black Press to present a fair and balanced view of Black America and to hold those in power accountable, including mainstream media.
When Samuel Cornish and John Russwurm started Freedom's Journal, the nation's first African-American newspaper, on March 16,1827, their mission was clear:
"We wish to plead our own cause ... for too long others have spoken for us," the journal said in its debut editorial.
That mission remains true for the Philadelphia Tribune and other African-American newspapers. There are more than 200 African American-owned newspapers, according to the National Newspaper Publishers Association.
The Tribune was founded in November 1884 by Christopher James Perry at Seventh and Šansom streets in an area now known as Jeweler's Row.
Perry was a Baltimore native who first dreamed of becoming a lawyer but later saw the need to start his own newspaper for African Americans. Perry said that "for my people to make progress, they must have a newspaper through which they can speak against injustice."
Since 1884, the Philadelphia Tribune has reflected the African-American experience and has written the first draft of African-American history in this city, region and nation. The Tribune is not only the oldest African-American newspaper in the nation; it is also one of the largest, with a weekly circulation of over 220,000 weekly readers and more than a quarter-million readers online.
The Tribune continues to be relevant by providing timely and compelling news and special publications including:
* A weekly supplement called the Learning Key, which provides news and information about what is happening in the School District ofPhiladelphia.
* The annual Yearbook edition in June, which provides photographs of every high school graduate in the Philadelphia public school system and a profile of each school.
* An annual Women of Achievement magazine and award program that honors African-American women achievers in the workplace.
* The Most Influential African Americans in Philadelphia magazine and awards program. The annual reception and awards program celebrates Philadelphia's most influential African Americans, ranging from government officials and business leaders to local civic and community agency heads, who are featured in a special edition of the Tribune Magazine.
* Special supplements on Black history, education and other topics, including an eight-part health series on issues that disproportionately affect African Americans.
In the past, the Black Press crusaded against slavery and legal segregation against African Americans. The Black Press also advocated for the right of African Americans to vote and hold elected office.
Today the Black Press must fight against voter suppression and hold local, state and national elected officials accountable for police brutality, poor schools and violent crime.
Because of racism, one of the most transformative actions that media can undertake is to portray African-American families as educated, hardworking, patriotic taxpayers. This image is radical because it is so seldom seen in mainstream media. Yet it is portrayed every week in the Black Press. The Black Press shows African Americans running businesses, Black students achieving in school, Black doctors and other health professionals going to churches and mosques to do free testing for the coronavirus, Black lawyers fighting discrimination, and local Black writers, musicians and filmmakers creating new art. The Black Press must continue to fight what the late writer Albert Murray described in his book "The Omni-Americans" as "the folklore of white supremacy and the fakelore of Black pathology."
Like mainstream media, the Tribune is challenged with declining advertising revenue and the switch by a growing number of readers from print to digital, which are forcing Blackowned publications to find ways to reduce spending and restructure what were already historically tight budgets. The coronavirus accelerated a trend that was already set in motion. Like mainstream newspapers, some African-American newspapers had to stop printing or have severely reduced staff.
To survive, the Tribune and other Black-owned media must continue to provide good journalism, especially in its role as a watchdog on government and other powerful institutions. It must remain financially stable by developing new readership and revenue through digital reader subscriptions, advertiser-sponsored events, funding from grants, and contributions from supporters who value local journalism.
A clear and focused mission and a commitment to innovation are the keys for continuing relevancy for the Philadelphia Tribune and the Black Press.

Texto completo: Wear your blank, watch your blank, and blank your blanks. At this stage of the pandemic, does anyone need help filling in the blanks of the simple steps we all can take to curb the spread of the coronavirus? And yet, it appears enough of us just aren't taking them.
As coronavirus cases have soared, Gov. Eric Holcomb and state and local health officials have repeatedly implored Hoosiers to adopt these basic public health practices, along with avoiding large public gatherings and staying home if you feel ill.
One need only look at coronavirus numbers to see the message may still not be getting through to many. Since the start of October, the number of people in Indiana infected has soared from below 15,000 to more than 70,000, according to the Regenstrief Institute, an Indianapolis research organization. Nearly twice as many people are hospitalized for COVID treatment today in the state's hospitals as were hospitalized during the peak in the spring.
On Wednesday Holcomb invited three Indiana hospital executives to appear at his weekly coronavirus news briefing and issue their own plea to the public to, yes, do all those things – wear masks, watch distances and wash hands.
Public health experts say they are not surprised that despite repeated pleas to people to do the right thing, too many people just, well, don't.
Several factors may explain why Holcomb and others have reminded people again and again to make these behaviors second nature, public health experts say. People often take the lead from what they see others doing, be those individuals national leaders or their neighbors. People need consistent messages that leave no doubt about the best course of action. And, in many instances, they need laws or policies to ensure they do what they are asked.
History has taught us that it can take decades for people to adopt public health behaviors, said Monica Kasting, an assistant professor in Purdue University's Department of Public Health.
"Just saying that people should do it without any enforcement hasn't worked for any public health practice that we see," she said. "Just hoping people do it is not going to work."
Making the
unhealthy choice
the hard choice
Consider seat belts. At first people fought back when public health officials first started recommending everyone buckle up in cars, she said. Eventually after years, the idea became widely accepted and entrenched in the law to the point where failing to do so can result in a ticket and a fine.
For the most part, people understand and accept the wisdom of following these behaviors, Kasting said. But that doesn't mean they necessarily do. Encouraging people to opt for preventive healthy behaviors can prove a challenge.
"What you have to do from a public health perspective most of the time is to make the healthy choice the easy choice and the unhealthy choice the hard choice," said Kasting, who added that she would like to see Holcomb enforce the state's mask mandate.
The more distant a threat seems, the less likely we are to act, she said. The more immediate a threat, the more likely we will respond. People are more willing to be tested for a disease than they are to engage in behavior to prevent it; for instance, people are more likely to agree to be screened for cervical cancer than they are to be vaccinated against it., she said.
In a similar vein, while people may still not follow the public health measures to stop the spread, once they fear infection, they will go for testing.
"People are much more willing to catch a disease early through screening and testing than to engage in healthy behaviors," Kasting said. "It's hard to get people to have future-oriented thinking to do something that's inconvenient. It's much easier once they have a symptom to then address it at the time."
Sending a strong public health message requires consistent information, particularly at the national level, public health experts agree. The western countries that have controlled the virus better than others have leaders who have followed the science and repeatedly appeared in public wearing masks, said Dr. Gabriel Bosslet, a pulmonologist at the Indiana University School of Medicine and the Hoosier behind the Hoosier COVID-19 Update, a Facebook page on which he tracks the virus.
In the wake of 9/11, Americans came together to help the nation heal, he said. Americans had a shared enemy: the terrorists. The nation's leaders could have spurred people to do something similar during the pandemic, uniting in our actions to keep the virus at bay. Instead, people are split on how to respond.
"Rather than leaders having chosen to make the virus the other," Bosslet said, "they have made other humans the other. We all should be pointing at the virus together and yelling at the virus."
How behaviors increase risk
Just as there has not been unity in attacking the virus, states have taken a variety of approaches to policy aimed at lowering spread. A recent New York Times report found that states that had the least restrictions now are experiencing the worst outbreaks.
Indiana came in 18th in the ranking of states going least to most restrictive. Indiana is among eight states with the greatest number of current hospitalizations per 100,000 people, and only 10 states have more cases per 100,000 than Indiana, according to the New York Times analysis.
In Indiana, people have been going out and about more than they have in other parts of the country, research by a consortium of professors from different universities found. The group, behind a project known as A 50-State COVID-19 Survey, has been exploring people's behaviors and how those are changing over the course of the pandemic.
The survey found that more people in Indiana are going to work, the store and visiting friends than people in the country as a whole are, said David Lazer, the website's co-lead and a professor of computational social science at Northeastern University. When it came to visiting bars, Indiana was way above average – no doubt aided by the fact that in some other states bars may have had more restrictions placed upon them.
"It does seem to be in a systematic fashion that folks in Indiana are behaving in a riskier fashion," Lazer said.
The fact that Hoosiers have the capability of going out also may decrease the likelihood that they will follow those public health recommendations that officials have pushed again and again.
Keeping bars and restaurants open while encouraging people to socially distance makes little sense, public health experts say. Such settings lend themselves to intimate social interactions that basically require people to lean close. Eating and drinking require people to lower their masks. Consuming alcohol can impair one's judgment.
Having bars and restaurants open, even at reduced capacity, sends a message that the situation is not all that dire.
"Clearly if you can go get a beer and hang out in a bar, how serious can it be," Lazer said. "It does send a message that it's not so serious. ... If you can get together in a restaurant, surely you can get together with your friends in your home."
The answer lies not in merely closing such establishments but in also finding ways to subsidize the owners so that the decision does not pit public health against people's financial well-being, many experts agree.
Why a local approach
might work better
Whether businesses are open or closed, there are better and worse ways of communicating the basic steps one can take as an individual to persuade people to change their behaviors. For many people, pandemic fatigue has set in, making it more difficult for officials to convey the message, said Ana Bento, assistant professor at Indiana University's School of Public Health.
Policies targeted for specific counties, as Holcomb has encouraged, may resonate more with individuals, especially if big announcements accompany any change in policy, Bento said. People may be more inclined to follow recommendations that come at the county level because they will view the threat as more immediate.
If the same announcement comes from a higher-level official, "I may think this is a problem of my state, not my county," Bento said.
Other public health experts say that the most successful way to get people to change their ways is to reach skeptics not necessarily through policies but through friendships.
If people see people they know or celebrities they recognize recommending a set of actions, they may be more likely to adopt those behaviors, said Lindsey Leininger, chief executive officer of Dear Pandemic, a website run by an interdisciplinary team of researchers that provides information on the coronavirus.
People may not be as likely to listen to the medical establishment from on high as they might be to respond to a local school nurse or librarian, Leininger said. Finding the right person to send such messages is particularly important for states like Indiana, which has a mix of liberals and conservatives.
"It's going to take the right messenger for the place. ... That personal connection is more powerful than any one policy," said Leininger, a clinical professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, "To me, this is really the path forward."
Once the message is sent, however, the even more difficult task becomes persuading those who hear it to put it into action.
Solving this puzzle is an age-old conundrum for the field of public health because it can be so easy to rationalize not doing what the experts recommend – be that losing weight, exercising, undergoing colon cancer screening or taking steps to lower one's risk of contracting the coronavirus.
"I think people really believe these behaviors prevent the spread of the virus. The communication issue is getting them to do it and to understand the necessity of it," Kasting said. "They think it's an all or nothing – either we go back to sheltering in place or we don't. And they don't understand there's a middle ground. ... People really, really want to live in a black or white world, and we live in a gray world."

Timothy Egan: Trump is leaving behind the blueprints for the end of democracy

Texto completo: Just when we thought we could sleep again. Just when we thought his malevolent reign was over, his poison bottled, that the sun was coming out tomorrow. Just when nearly 80 million Americans could shout the words of Dr. Seuss to Marvin K. Mooney: “Please go now!”
Then, this: a shameless attempt to reject the will of hundreds of thousands of voters in the most populous county in Michigan and ultimately hand a state that Joe Biden won by some 157,000 votes over Donald Trump.
And this: In Nevada and Pennsylvania, Trump’s campaign asked courts to thwart the choice of a majority of voters and award their states’ Electoral College votes to the only president in history to lose the popular vote twice. It promised evidence of fraud but produced none. It was a blunt, raw, purely Trumpian move. Try to stop me .
And this: Trump has invited Michigan legislators to the White House in a last-ditch — and legally dubious — effort to subvert the election.
What’s unfolding now is an attempted coup by a con. It’s a bigger political scandal than Russian interference four years ago. And yes, it is likely to fail, and the system is likely to prevail. But the American majority cannot rest, nor rely on its sense of decency, until the election hooligans are beaten back.
Failing in court, this most authoritarian of presidents is pressuring Little Trumpers everywhere to overturn an election that Trump’s own cybersecurity chief, Christopher Krebs, said was “the most secure in American history.” He’s trying to force canvassers, certifiers, election board referees and state legislators to create enough chaos so that he can steal a win.
The good news is that a decent majority of Americans think the election was conducted freely and fairly, a belief that has the added benefit of being true. Krebs, a Trump appointee who oversaw defense of the election for the Department of Homeland Security, issued a statement saying, “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” That assessment got him fired by the president Tuesday.
The bad news is that an indecent majority of Trump voters think Biden won because of fraud. The Big Lie — that the election was rigged unless Trump is declared the winner — thrives in a disinformation ecosystem.
Since the election, I’ve been trying to remain open-minded about what moved more than 73 million Americans to vote for Trump, knowing that he’s an awful human being and a nation-wrecker, trying to soil every institutional value we hold sacred.
I understand the tribalism, the urge to push back against condescending libs and the suffocating ubiquity of political correctness, the sense that only Trump can save a certain way of life.
But then Trump unleashed his flying monkeys to try to take back the office he lost by nearly 6 million in the popular vote.
Consider just how openly racist and undemocratic the Michigan debacle was. Two white Republican canvassers refused to certify the results of the state’s most populous Democratic county, which contains Black-majority Detroit. Was there evidence of fraud? No. The fig leaf was the routine clerical and counting errors found throughout Michigan — and certainly not enough votes to overturn the result.
One of those canvassers, Monica Palmer, suggested that the white-majority areas of the county could be certified, while the Black-majority city of Detroit could not. The pro-Trump canvassers relented only after being buried under an avalanche of outrage and threats. But after the president called at least one of them, both Republicans again attempted to keep Wayne County’s votes from counting, although by then it was too late.
This was a racial disenfranchisement move so blatant it would make Jim Crow blush. Michigan Republican leaders applauded this, and Trump tweeted, “Flip Michigan back to TRUMP.” Among the national Republican leaders, those with a conscience, a group that could fit in a broom closet, have been quiet. Humor him, they said. He’ll eventually sulk away.
It wasn’t just the Black majority in Detroit that Republicans tried to render powerless. The votes of veterans and first-responders, the sick and disabled, first-time voters and longtime voters were headed for a garbage bin to please a loser crying for a do-over.
“American democracy cracked last night, but it didn’t break,” said Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, on the morning after the certification back-and-forth. “We are seeing a real threat to everything we believe in.”
One of those beliefs is the idea that honorable people will put aside partisan passions to keep the machinery of democracy moving forward.
But it’s pretty hard to do that when the routine act of ballot counting has become a life-threatening job. Arizona’s secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, described “ongoing and escalating threats of violence” against her and her family for trying to perform her duty.
This is Trump’s legacy: an attempt to blow up an election, from Wayne County, Michigan, to Maricopa County, Arizona. For Trump the failed businessman, cheating and suing were a way of life. For Trump the failed president, cheating and suing are a blueprint for his followers into the future. And I fear there’s no going back.

The work of the Michigan Board of State Canvassers is not glamorous and rarely draws much attention. Its members handle matters like reviewing petition signatures and helping local clerks find voting machines.
But on Monday, the national spotlight will fall on one of the board’s normally mundane tasks: reviewing results from the presidential election that have been certified by Michigan’s 83 counties and giving a stamp of approval.
The winner is clear. Joe Biden beat President Donald Trump in the state by more than 150,000 votes, according to the Michigan Bureau of Elections. But Trump and his Republican allies are trying to upend that reality by urging the board to refuse to certify the election results. They have made baseless claims about discrepancies in the vote tallies, especially in Wayne County, which includes Detroit and is predominantly Black, and have argued that an investigation should be carried out before the state’s 16 electoral votes are awarded to Biden. (Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, said Sunday that state law dictated that no audit or investigation could be done until the election was certified, because state elections officials cannot legally gain access to poll books or ballot boxes before then.)
The Board of State Canvassers, which will meet at 1 p.m. Eastern on Monday, includes two Republicans and two Democrats. While election law experts say the certification vote is a strictly ministerial duty that the board members are obligated to fulfill, political operatives in Michigan are preparing for a chain of events in which the two Republicans on the board follow the Trump campaign’s wishes.
A 2-2 deadlock, which would prolong Republicans’ unprecedented attempts to overturn this year’s presidential race, would most likely prompt Democrats to ask the state Court of Appeals to order the board to do its constitutional duty and certify the election results.
So who are the members of the canvassing board? Three of them have served on the panel for several election cycles; the fourth was appointed in 2018 by former Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican.
The Democrats
Jeannette Bradshaw, 44, the chairwoman of the board, is from Ortonville, about 40 miles north of downtown Detroit. She is an electrician by trade, but serves as the recording secretary and registrar for her International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local in Detroit.
Appointed to the board in 2013, Bradshaw said she was hoping for a smooth and efficient meeting Monday despite the possibility that it could turn into the same type of live-streamed virtual brawl that occurred last week in Wayne County. There, two Republicans on Wayne’s canvassing board initially refused to certify the county’s results before backtracking after several hours of outraged comments from voters who said they were being disenfranchised.
“I’m trying to block out all the noise and focus on my job,” Bradshaw said. “That’s where I’m at.”
She said she would look at the report on the results by the state Bureau of Elections and make a decision based on its recommendation.
That report found that out of more than 250,000 votes cast in Detroit, there were problems with about 350 ballots. Biden won the city over Trump by 94% to 5%, and he carried Wayne County by 68% to 30%. The number of discrepancies, 72% of which could be easily explained, according to the state Bureau of Elections, was significantly lower than during the 2016 presidential election.
“I’m getting lots of emails, asking me to certify, not to certify,” Bradshaw said. “We get the report, and that’s what we go off of. I appreciate that people are participating.”
In the meantime, she added, “I’m going to turn off my phone and go outside and rake some leaves.”
Julie Matuzak, 66, of Clinton Township in Detroit’s northern suburbs, said she expected the board to certify the election results.
“I have confidence that we will do what we’re supposed to do,” said Matuzak, a retired political director for the American Federation of Teachers in Michigan who was appointed to the board in 2010. “We are the third step in a process that checks and crosschecks and balances the results. It’s all done in public. The statute says the board shall certify the election. If you follow the rules, you certify the election.”
Matuzak views her job as safeguarding elections. She recalled, with a touch of irony, how Trump sued in 2016 to stop a recount in Michigan requested by Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate.
“I would have loved to finish that recount because what it showed before it was stopped was there were very few problems,” Matuzak said. “My biggest fear now is that no matter what we do, there are going to be people out there who are never going to believe that it was a fair election.”
The Republicans
Norm Shinkle, 70, of Williamston, near Lansing, is an open supporter of Trump, volunteering for the campaign and even singing the national anthem at a rally for the president in Michigan last month.
A longtime politician in Michigan, he has served as a poll challenger in the past. His wife, Mary Shinkle, was a poll challenger this year at the TCF Center in Detroit, where absentee ballots were counted, and she filed an affidavit complaining about the tense environment there.
Shinkle, who was appointed to the board in 2008, said that he had some concerns about the vote tally in Wayne County, especially in Detroit, and that an investigation there would be acceptable. He, too, said he had been receiving hundreds of phone calls and emails from people pressuring him either to certify or not to certify the results. He said he had not heard from Trump or his campaign.
Shinkle said his time as a judge on the Michigan Tax Tribunal had taught him that you can’t make up your mind until you see both sides of a case. He said that was what he planned to do.
“I’m just focused on Monday and reviewing all the information for the meeting,” he said. “No one knows how the vote is going to go. But I just have to do the best that I can based on what’s ethical and legal.”
Aaron Van Langevelde, 30, of Charlotte in mid-Michigan, is the unknown quantity on the board. Appointed in 2018, he has declined interview requests from The New York Times and other news outlets.
He is a lawyer who works for the Republican caucus in the Michigan House of Representatives.
After the state’s primary elections in August, he said he was seriously worried about the number of precincts that had voting disparities in Detroit, despite the fact that the problems were relatively minor, and expressed reluctance to certify the results without a pledge that the secretary of state would take control over the city’s elections.
“I want to make sure we’re doing whatever we can to prevent the same thing from happening in November,” he said at the time. “That would be a disaster.”
The state was involved in helping the city prepare for the Nov. 3 general election, providing workers and training.

URUMQI, China — At the end of a desolate road rimmed by prisons, deep within a complex bristling with cameras, U.S. technology is powering one of the most invasive parts of China’s surveillance state.
The computers inside the complex, known as the Urumqi Cloud Computing Center, are among the world’s most powerful. They can watch more surveillance footage in a day than one person could in a year. They look for faces and patterns of human behavior. They track cars. They monitor phones.
The Chinese government uses these computers to watch untold numbers of people in Xinjiang, a western region of China where Beijing has unleashed a campaign of surveillance and suppression in the name of combating terrorism.
Chips made by Intel and Nvidia, U.S. semiconductor companies, have powered the complex since it opened in 2016. By 2019, at a time when reports said that Beijing was using advanced technology to imprison and track Xinjiang’s mostly Muslim minorities, new U.S.-made chips helped it join the list of the world’s fastest supercomputers. Both Intel and Nvidia say they were unaware of what they called misuse of their technology.
Powerful technology and its potential misuse cut to the heart of the decisions the Biden administration must face. The Trump administration banned the sale of advanced semiconductors and other technology to Chinese companies implicated in national security or humans rights issues. A crucial question for President-elect Joe Biden will be whether to firm up, loosen or rethink those restrictions.
Some figures in the technology industry argue that the ban went too far, cutting off valuable sales of U.S. products with plenty of harmless uses and spurring China to create its own advanced semiconductors. Indeed, China is spending billions of dollars to develop high-end chips.
By contrast, critics of the use of U.S. technology in repressive systems say that buyers exploit workarounds and that the industry and officials should track sales and usage more closely.
Companies often point out that they have little say over where their products end up. The chips in the Urumqi complex, for example, were sold by Intel and Nvidia to Sugon, the Chinese company backing the center. Sugon is an important supplier to Chinese military and security forces, but it also makes computers for ordinary companies.
That argument is not good enough anymore, said Jason Matheny, founding director of Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology and a former U.S. intelligence official.
“Government and industry need to be more thoughtful now that technologies are advancing to a point where you could be doing real-time surveillance using a single supercomputer on millions of people, potentially,” he said.
There is no evidence the sale of Nvidia or Intel chips, which predate the Trump order, broke any laws. Intel said it no longer sells semiconductors for supercomputers to Sugon. Still, both continue to sell chips to the Chinese firm.
The Urumqi complex’s existence and use of U.S. chips are no secret, and there was no shortage of clues that Beijing was using it for surveillance. Since 2015, when the complex began development, state media and Sugon had boasted of its ties to the police.
In 5-year-old marketing materials distributed in China, Nvidia promoted the Urumqi complex’s capabilities and boasted that the “high-capacity video surveillance application” had won customer satisfaction.
Nvidia said that the materials referred to older versions of its products and that video surveillance then was a normal part of the discussion around “smart cities,” an effort in China to use technology to solve urban issues like pollution, traffic and crime. A spokesperson for Nvidia said the company had no reason to believe its products would be used “for any improper purpose.”
The spokesperson added that Sugon “hasn’t been a significant Nvidia customer” since last year’s ban. He also said that Nvidia had not provided technical assistance for Sugon since then.
A spokesperson for Intel, which still sells Sugon lower-end chips, said it would restrict or stop business with any customer that it found had used its products to violate human rights.
Publicity over Intel’s China business appears to have had an impact within the company. One business unit last year drafted ethics guidelines for its technology’s artificial intelligence applications, according to three people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because Intel had not made the guidelines public.
Sugon said in a statement that the complex was originally aimed at tracking license plates and managing other smart-city tasks, but its systems proved ineffective and were switched to other uses. But as recently as September, official Chinese government media described the complex as a center for processing video and images for managing cities.
Advances in technology have given authorities around the world substantial power to watch and sort people. In China, leaders have pushed technology to an even greater extreme. Artificial intelligence and genetic testing are used to screen people to see whether they are Uighurs, one of Xinjiang’s minority groups. Chinese companies and authorities claim their systems can detect religious extremism or opposition to the Communist Party.
The Urumqi Cloud Computing Center — also sometimes called the Xinjiang Supercomputing Center — broke onto the list of the world’s fastest computers in 2018, ranking No. 221. In November 2019, new chips helped push its computer to No. 135.
Two data centers run by Chinese security forces sit next door, a way to potentially cut down on lag time, according to experts. Also nearby are six prisons and reeducation centers.
When a New York Times reporter tried to visit the center in 2019, he was followed by plainclothes police officers. A guard turned him away.
The official Chinese media and Sugon’s previous statements depict the complex as a surveillance center. In August 2017, local officials said that the center would support a Chinese police surveillance project called Sharp Eyes and that it could search 100 million photos in a second. By 2018, according to company disclosures, its computers could connect to 10,000 video feeds and analyze 1,000 simultaneously, using artificial intelligence.
“With the help of cloud computing, big data, deep learning and other technologies, the intelligent video analysis engine can integrate police data and applications from video footage, Wi-Fi hot spots, checkpoint information, and facial recognition analysis to support the operations of different departments” within the Chinese police, Sugon said in a 2018 article posted to an official social media account.
On the occasion of a visit by local Communist Party leaders to the complex that year, it wrote on its website that the computers had “upgraded the thinking from after-the-fact tracking to before-the-fact predictive policing.”
In Xinjiang, predictive policing often serves as shorthand for preemptive arrests aimed at behavior deemed disloyal to the party. That could include a show of Muslim piety, links to family living overseas, owning two phones or not owning a phone, according to Uighur testimony and official Chinese policy documents.
Technology helps sort vast amounts of data that humans cannot process, said Jack Poulson, a former Google engineer and founder of the advocacy group Tech Inquiry.
“When you have something approaching a surveillance state, your primary limitation is on your ability to identify events of interest within your feeds,” he said. “The way you scale up your surveillance is through machine learning and large-scale AI.”
The Urumqi complex went into development before reports of abuses in Xinjiang were widespread. By 2019, governments around the world were protesting China’s conduct in Xinjiang. That year, the Sugon computer appeared on the international supercomputing rankings, using Intel Xeon Gold 5118 processors and Nvidia Tesla V100 advanced artificial intelligence chips.
It is not clear how or whether Sugon will obtain chips powerful enough keep the Urumqi complex on that list. But lesser technology typically used to run harmless tasks can also be used for surveillance and suppression. Customers can also use resellers in other countries or chips made by U.S. companies overseas.
Last year, police in two Xinjiang counties, Yanqi and Qitai, purchased surveillance systems that ran on lower-level Intel chips, according to government procurement documents. The Kizilsu Kyrgyz autonomous prefecture public security bureau in April purchased a computing platform that used servers running less-powerful Intel chips, according to the documents, though the agency had been placed on a Trump administration blacklist last year for its involvement in surveillance.
China’s dependence on U.S. chips has, for now, helped the world push back, said Maya Wang, a China researcher with Human Rights Watch.
“I’m afraid in a few years’ time, Chinese companies and government will find their own way to develop chips and these capabilities,” Wang said. “Then there will be no way to get a handle on trying to stop these abuses.”

NEW YORK — By midnight Saturday, about 80 guests had crowded into a sex club in Queens to drink and party. At around the same time, another group that grew to about 120 revelers was just starting to gather and dance at an illegal club in Manhattan.
City sheriffs broke up both parties early Sunday — the latest crackdown as officials try to rein in behavior that could fuel the second wave of the coronavirus. Seven people and one business face a range of charges in connection with the parties, including a failure to protect health and safety in violation of the city’s health code, the authorities said.
The sites of the two gatherings lacked liquor licenses and other certifications, according to the sheriff’s office, and images from the events showed many attendees were failing to wear masks or practice social distancing.
The busts underscored the continued challenges of persuading New Yorkers to follow safety guidelines even as a second wave of the virus hits, particularly as the winter months approach and parties move indoors.
During the past four weeks, the sheriff’s office has shut down several large parties and events, ranging from a gathering of close to 170 people at an illicit club in Brooklyn to a Halloween celebration in the Bronx with more than 550 attendees. Sheriff Joseph Fucito said at the start of the month that his office had responded to about one large event every evening since August.
Earlier this month, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that private indoor and outdoor gatherings across the state would be limited to 10 people. But enforcing those rules is likely to be even more difficult as the weather turns colder and as people celebrate the holidays.
The recent rash of parties comes as positivity rates kick upward: On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the citywide seven-day average positivity rate was 3.09%, while the statewide rate was 2.74%, according to Cuomo.
The mayor ordered the closing of all public schools last week after the city’s positivity rate reached the 3% mark. Cuomo also warned that larger restrictions on indoor dining, mass gatherings and houses of worship might soon follow if metrics continued to worsen. On Sunday, the governor said that some areas of Staten Island were on pace to enter the state’s most stringent level of lockdown as soon as this week, calling the borough a “serious problem.”
The sex club party in Queens was broken up after officials received a complaint that a club in the Ditmars Steinway area was playing loud music late into the night, Sheriff Fucito said Sunday.
Deputies arrived at around 12:05 a.m. Sunday and found more than 80 people gathering inside the building at 40-19 20th Ave., many of whom did not wear masks and were not social distancing, Fucito said. Upon entering one small room, he said, authorities also discovered three couples who were having sex.
The party was hosted by Caligula New York, a swingers club that has posted announcements for similar late-night events on social media over the past few months. The organization and its manager, Roy Bacoy of Woodside, Queens, face fines and charges, the sheriff’s office said, and one patron was also charged with disorderly conduct.
Bacoy could not immediately be reached for comment Sunday.
About 30 minutes earlier, around 11:30 p.m. Saturday, authorities had begun observing a building at 260 W. 36th St. in Midtown Manhattan. They watched about 75 people enter through a service entrance as security guards directed attendees indoors and attempted to keep crowds outside small to avoid attracting attention, the sheriff’s office said.
About 2 1/2 hours later, deputies went up to the building’s third floor and found more than 120 guests who were buying and drinking alcohol, smoking hookah and dancing, the sheriff’s office said.
Five people — the organizer, a bartender, a DJ and two security guards — face fines and charges including the unauthorized warehousing of alcohol, according to the sheriff’s office.
The party’s organizer, Chatiris Ioannis of Manhattan, could not immediately be reached for comment Sunday.
Some recent large gatherings in the city have spurred outbreaks of the virus. In late October, Long Island health officials rushed to curb an outbreak in Suffolk County when dozens of people tested positive after attending a Sweet 16 party in September.

To Wear Their Masks, the Beards — and a Tradition — Had to Go.

Tony Cammarata dreaded the news he had to deliver to his employees. They were not losing their jobs. They were not losing their perks.
They were losing their beards.
Cammarata, who oversees the ski patrol for an area in the Rocky Mountains west of Denver, had to clamp down on the facial hair so the patrol could properly wear their N95 respirator masks for protection in the coronavirus pandemic.
But he knew this would be a tough measure to accept for the men on his crew (47 of the resort’s 56 patrollers). For the vast majority of them, beards and the ski patrol go together like snow and the mountains.
“You could tell people they’re not getting a merit increase, that you’re cutting their skiing privileges,” said Cammarata, the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area operations director. “It’s not as bad as telling them they have to shave. The whole beard thing is ingrained in our culture.”
The masks are required this season. And they fit much better without the facial hair.
“You need to have a good, tight seal,’’ said Dr. Kendrick Adnan, the medical adviser for the Arapahoe Basin, Copper Mountain and Keystone ski resorts and a former ski patroller himself. “Facial hair will interfere with that and put that ski patroller at risk.”
“I’ve known many ski patrollers whose facial hair is near and dear,” he added. “This year is going to be painful for them.”
Painful does not quite capture it.
“It was shocking,” said Hunter Mortensen, a longtime Breckenridge, Colorado, ski patroller who recently shaved for the first time in 10 years. “It was like that jumping-in-a-cold-lake-feeling the first time the wind blew.”
His colleague, Ryan Dineen, who has not owned a razor since 2005 and whose wife has never seen him without a beard, agreed that hearing about the new shaving protocol was jarring.
“The knee-jerk reaction was, how dare you? This is who I am,” Dineen said, preparing to succumb to the razor in the coming days. “I might have to FaceTime with my dad so he can reteach me how to use a razor.”
Ski resorts are trying to recover from a spring season cut short by virus lockdowns. Skiers now face a range of precautions including mask requirements, social distancing measures on lifts, reservation-only time on slopes and some closed indoor dining spots.
By and large, ski patrol members cutting their beards see it as a small inconvenience for the sake of safety and keeping the slopes active. But all that shaving has come with some peculiarities.
In ski areas like Arapahoe Basin, about 80% of the male patrollers have had to drastically change (or introduce) shaving regimens. A chart issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlighting the variety of facial hairstyles permitted with a fitted respirator mask has become a go-to resource.
“It’s one of the funniest government-issued documents I’ve ever seen,” Cammarata said. “It’s a pictogram with 40-plus styles of facial hair. They’ve named them all. We’ve always had a long tradition of hiring these Viking-looking men to do this job. When I showed them this chart, we all laughed hysterically. We’ve been trying to keep it pretty lighthearted. People started showing up with some ridiculous facial hair.”
Bearded patrollers say their facial hair serves as protection against the elements — a warm layer in strong winds, blizzards, frigid temperatures and harsh high-elevation sun.
“It’s like Mother Nature’s neck gaiter,” said Drew Kneeland, the patrol director in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “Also, it’s funny how people look at you differently if you have a beard or not. For some reason, people don’t question someone with a beard as much as if they’re clean-shaven. It becomes part of your identity and how you interact with the world around you.”
And if Kneeland is being honest, “if you’re skiing deep powder and you come down to the bottom and have a face full of snow, it’s kind of fun.”
For Rick Hamlin, a National Ski Patrol historian who has covered Smugglers’ Notch in Vermont for 48 years and has had a bushy mustache since 1979, the prospect of shaving is something he is willing to put up with to continue doing what he loves.
“I’d be sad about it, but given the choice between patrolling and having facial hair, I would definitely do it,” Hamlin said. “One thing you can say about patrollers everywhere is they’re used to adapting and doing whatever is needed to get the job done.”
Mark Hardy, longtime patroller at Alpental, Washington, said that he expected initial grumbling among his hairy co-workers, but added that it would not be unlike other safety measures that have come into play over the years.
“They made us all switch to helmets several years ago,’’ he said. “I thought there would be an uprising.”
Mike O’Hara, a ski patrol supervisor in Killington, Vermont, recently shaved the beard he had for nearly 30 years.
“We have a few patrollers whose beards are older than some of their co-workers,” he said. “After the initial shock of learning the new shaving protocol, most patrollers understood it’s a small step to take to help ensure the safety of ourselves, our families, our company and the community as a whole.”
And, really, it’s a small step given the gravity of the pandemic.
“I’m not a front-line doctor in an ER who has to wear an N95 all day,” Dineen said. “I don’t live in a city. There’s a lot of things about COVID that haven’t impacted us here. As much as we love our facial hair, we love what we do more. This beard will come back. Maybe I’ll shave it and think, man, I look like an adult for the first time in my life.”
And many patrollers are finding a silver lining. “Most of us look a lot younger and less weathered,” Mortensen said.
“The beard has been part of our iconic look. There are going to be some grown men with separation anxiety for a little while. They might need a big hug every now and then.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
RIO DE JANEIRO — The acerbic tweet came naturally to Brazilian novelist and journalist J.P. Cuenca, who was several months into a quarantine doom-scrolling routine.
One June afternoon, he read an article about the millions of dollars President Jair Bolsonaro’s government had spent advertising on radio and television stations owned by its evangelical Christian allies, particularly the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, a Protestant denomination that has helped propel Brazil’s political shift rightward.
“Brazilians will only be free when the last Bolsonaro is strangled with the entrails of the last pastor from the Universal Church,” Cuenca wrote on Twitter, riffing on an oft-cited 18th-century quote about the fates that should befall kings and priests.
He put his phone down, made coffee and carried on with his day, oblivious that the missive would soon cost him his job with a German news outlet, prompt death threats and spark a cascade of litigation. At least 130 Universal Church pastors, claiming “moral injury,” have sued him in remote courthouses around the vast country.
Cuenca is among the latest targets of a type of legal crusade that pastors and politicians in Brazil are increasingly waging against journalists and critics in a bitterly polarized nation. Defendants or their lawyers must then show up in person for each suit, leading them in a mad rush around the country.
“Their strategy is to sue me in different parts of the country so I have to defend myself in all these corners of Brazil, a continent-size nation,” he said. “They want to instill fear in future critical voices and to drive me to ruin or madness. It’s Kafka in the tropics.”
Press freedom advocates say the sheer number of suits against Cuenca is unusual, but the type of campaign he faces no longer is.
Leticia Kleim, a legal expert at the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalists, said, “We’re seeing the justice system become a means to censure and impede the work of journalists.”
She said the number of lawsuits against journalists and news organizations seeking the removal of content or damages for critical coverage has increased notably during the presidency of Bolsonaro, who often berates and insults journalists.
“The stigmatizing rhetoric has incentivized this practice,” she said. “Politicians portray journalists as the enemy, and their base of supporters act the same way.”
Cuenca said he didn’t deem his tweet particularly offensive given the state of political discourse in Brazil.
After all, the country is governed by a president who supports torture, once told a female lawmaker she was too ugly to rape, said he would rather his son die in an accident than be gay, and in 2018 was criminally charged with inciting hatred against Black people, women and Indigenous people.
Earlier this year, Bolsonaro lashed out at two reporters who asked about a corruption case against one of his sons. He told one he had a “terribly homosexual face” and said to another that he was tempted to smash his face in.
Cuenca saw his criticism as comparatively high-minded. He said he disdains the Universal Church, which has grown into a transnational behemoth since its founding in the 1970s, because he believes it fueled Bolsonaro’s rise to the presidency, enabling ecological destruction, reckless handling of the coronavirus pandemic and institutional chaos.
“I was totally bored, distracted, procrastinating and angry over politics,” Cuenca said. “What I wrote was satire.”
The first sign of trouble was the wave of attacks that poured in on his social media accounts. Then came a one-line email from his editor at the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, where he wrote a regular column. “Cuenca, did you really tweet that?” she asked.
He offered to write a column explaining the history of the quote — versions of which have been attributed to French priest Jean Meslier and later to Denis Diderot and François-Marie Voltaire — and offering examples of modern-day intellectuals using variations on the line to comment on Brazilian problems.
But the editor called the tweet “abominable” and told Cuenca his column was being canceled. Deutsche Welle issued a statement about its decision, saying it repudiates “any type of hate speech or incitement to violence.”
Eduardo Bolsonaro, a federal lawmaker and one of the president’s sons, celebrated Deutsche Welle’s decision in a message on Twitter and said he intended to sue Cuenca.
In August, Cuenca was startled to learn the tweet had led to a referral for criminal prosecution. But Frederico de Carvalho Paiva, the prosecutor who handled the referral, declined to charge Cuenca, writing in a decision that the journalist had a constitutional right to criticize the president, even in “rude and offensive” terms.
“That’s freedom of expression, which can’t be throttled by ignorant people who are unable to grasp hyperbole,” the prosecutor wrote.
Cuenca searched his name in a database of legal cases and found the first of dozens of strikingly similar lawsuits by pastors from the Universal Church, seeking monetary damages for the distress they said the tweet had caused them. They were filed under a legal mechanism that requires the defendant or a legal representative to appear in person to mount a defense.
Some pastors have found receptive judges, including one who ordered that Cuenca delete his entire Twitter account as a form of reparations. But another judge found the action meritless and called it in a ruling “almost an abuse of the legal process.”
In a statement, the Universal Church said it had played no role in the torrent of litigation. “Brazil’s Constitution guarantees everyone — including evangelical pastors — the right to seek justice,” the church said. “Whoever feels they have been offended or disrespected can seek reparations before the courts, which get to decide who is right.”
The statement said that the right to freedom of speech in Brazil is “not absolute” and that satire is not a defense for religious prejudice. “It must be remembered that the assertion by the writer João Paulo Cuenca provoked repudiation among many Christians on social media.”
Taís Gasparian, a lawyer in São Paulo who has defended several people who faced similar bursts of almost identical simultaneous lawsuits, said plaintiffs like the Universal Church abuse a legal mechanism that was created in the 1990s to make the justice system accessible and affordable to ordinary people.
The type of action filed against Cuenca doesn’t require that a plaintiff hire a lawyer, but defendants who don’t show up in person or send a lawyer often lose by default. Universal Church pastors began a similar wave of suits against journalist Elvira Lobato after she published an article in December 2007 documenting links between the church and companies based in tax havens.
The timing and the striking similarities among the lawsuits filed against Lobato and Cuenca make it clear they were copy-paste jobs, Gasparian said.
“It’s enormously cruel,” she said. “It’s an intimidation tactic in a country where the traditional media is facing big challenges.”
Paulo José Avelino da Silva, one of the pastors who sued Cuenca, said he took the action on his own initiative because the tweet offended him.
“As a Brazilian it made me feel like I was being excluded from my own country,” said the pastor, who lives in Maragogi, a beach town in the northeastern state of Alagoas. “If he had retracted what he wrote, I would not have sued.”
Cuenca said he hoped the ordeal would lead to changes in the justice system that prevent similar legal barrages. And perhaps the whole thing will become the subject of his next creative project.
“I’m thinking of making a film,” he said. He envisions traveling to remote towns to meet the pastors who sued him and see what happens if they just sit face to face and exchange views in good faith. “I’d like to talk to them and find what we have in common.”

The Pomegranate Harvest Is Life Here. The Taliban Shattered It.

ARGHANDAB, Afghanistan — Crack a pomegranate in half and its blood-red seed-filled chambers make it look almost like a broken heart. In Arghandab district, which in Afghanistan is almost synonymous with the fruit, a Taliban offensive has cut the heart out of the harvest season, leaving farming families desperate.
The offensive here in southern Afghanistan came at the end of October, the prime month for a pomegranate harvest that goes from September to November. On a recent day this month, Gulalay Amiri and 10 of his workers gathered whatever was left in fear. Several farmers in an orchard nearby had recently been killed by buried Taliban explosives.
“When the fighting started we couldn’t come here,” said Amiri, kneeling among his workers with pink earmuffs framing his tanned and aging face. Amiri and his men were disappointed at how few bags and boxes they were able to fill. “Most of the pomegranates were destroyed.”
Arghandab was at the center of some of the most intense fighting at the height of the war 10 years ago, when Americans came to Kandahar province to drive the Taliban out during President Barack Obama’s troop surge. But in recent years, locals said, things had stayed relatively quiet, and Arghandab had experienced a streak of good harvests.
But even in the midst of peace negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan government, residents described the recent fighting as the worst they had seen since the Soviets came in the 1980s, bulldozing their fields and scorching the earth.
In the broader scheme of 40 years of war, a botched pomegranate season pales in comparison to the rising violence across the country. But for the people of Arghandab — from farmer to shopkeeper, all trying to eke out livings — the fighting only highlights the uncertain fates confronting so many Afghans despite the talk of peace.
“I am faced with loss,” Amiri said, his gloved hands rotating a pomegranate, looking for rot or cracks. He had to fire 40 of his workers because of the fighting — a trend that has affected roughly 1,000 day laborers in Arghandab.
An important part of Afghanistan’s agricultural economy belongs to the pomegranate, and while domestically traded and grown in other provinces, the fruit is the pride of Kandahar. The province is a major exporter to Pakistan and India, but this year the shipments were late and smaller than usual, according to fruit exporters interviewed for this article. One said he made only a third as much as usual this year.
“The Arghandab crop was not good because we did not receive it on time,” said Jan Mohammed, 34, another pomegranate exporter based in Kandahar city. “It has not been a good year.”
The monetary losses pull down an economy already flagging, like other countries’, with the spread of the coronavirus.
Those financial impacts were acutely felt by the people of Arghandab.
Lewanai Agha, 76, in a white scarf and turban, looked on from the edge of his orchard as Amiri boxed his pomegranates. Both Agha and Amiri have farmed and sold pomegranates their entire lives, like many here, and the fruit has been a way of life for generations.
Each box of pomegranates here is proudly marked with a green stencil denoting its origin: Arghandab.
When the fighting started, Agha, himself an insurgent commander during the war against the Soviet Union in the 1980s, sent the women and children of his 32-strong family to Kandahar city while he and the other men stayed to protect his land and livestock.
“We were in the crossfire,” said Agha, his eyes narrowing as he recounted the fighting. Unable to take his fruit to market and compounded by a rainstorm, most of his pomegranates were destroyed. In 2019, Agha made roughly $9,300, he said. This year: about $620.
“The orchard was our only source of income,” Agha said. “We don’t know what else to do.”
His entire family relies on that revenue, Agha said. “This is the only time we’ve suffered like this since the Soviet invasion,” he said. That was when Soviet troops bulldozed his orchard.
As long as Agha can pick pomegranates and feed his family, it doesn’t matter which flag — the government’s or the Taliban’s — flies over his head, he said. Agha, like many farmers caught in the unending back-and-forth struggle of the war, showed a level of antipathy toward both sides of the conflict.
Agha’s orchard sits yards away from the banks of the Arghandab River and a strategically important bridge, built more than a decade ago, that allows people and vehicles to cross on their way to and from Kandahar city.
That strip of land quickly became the Taliban’s front line, where machine gun and rocket fire was reflected in the river’s flowing waters nightly as October turned to November.
Why the Taliban attacked at the height of the harvest is unclear. A Taliban official, who spoke to The New York Times on condition of anonymity because he was not cleared to speak publicly about tactics, explained that the insurgents had not meant to push so far into Arghandab and had wanted to focus on other districts. But for some reason, he said, the fighters went farther into the orchards than planned, prompting an outcry from local elders. The fighters then withdrew — out of respect, the official said, not because of U.S. airstrikes or the government’s counterattacks.
Now with the fighting receding to other districts in the south, hidden explosives left behind in fields remain a threat to the thousands of families reliant on the pomegranate harvest. Roadside bombs have always been a staple of the Taliban, but their use in the orchards at the height of the harvest, likely to delay the government’s advance, was seen as especially cruel.
Abdullah Khan, 30, an Afghan national police commander in charge of the checkpoint that overlooked Amiri’s packaging efforts and the strategic Arghandab bridge, recalled how he could hear the rumble of the American jets overhead during the fighting.
That American bombardment was the only thing that kept the Taliban from completely overrunning the district, security officials said.
“They came in large numbers,” Khan said of the advancing Taliban. What set the recent offensive apart — the worst he had seen in his 20 years in the district — was that the insurgents did not fight with hit-and-run attacks; they came in waves and held their ground.
One of Khan’s concrete outposts at the checkpoint clearly bore the marks of a rocket strike: a shallow crater surrounded by raylike gashes from spiraling shrapnel. “No one could rescue us,” he said.
Khan insisted that police had stayed and fought for the outpost. Nearby farmers accuse them of abandoning the post — as was said to have happened at several other police checkpoints. Khan’s men, dressed in civilian clothes, drinking tea and smoking hashish at 10 in the morning, wouldn’t say one way or the other.
With his pocket of government control now quiet, Khan and his fellow police officers have been fielding relentless complaints. Arghandab’s farmers just want to return to their orchards and fields, free of Taliban explosives and hoping for some sort of aid from the government as winter sets in.
That includes Agha and his large family.
About 3,500 families have been affected by the fighting, said Sharif Ahmad Rasuli, the district governor in Arghandab, adding that only 200 had received some sort of food aid by mid-November. Fifteen civilians were killed in the attacks, he added, including at least five farmers who later died in their fields from hidden explosives.
“If we don’t get any aid our lives will be destroyed,” Agha said. “We won’t be able to eat or fill the stomachs of our children.”

Guitar Center Files for Bankruptcy

Guitar Center, the largest U.S. retailer of musical instruments, filed for bankruptcy protection late Saturday.
The company, which was struggling to compete against online rivals even before the pandemic, was hit hard when it was forced to temporarily close most of its stores earlier this year.
It entered Chapter 11 restructuring proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Eastern District of Virginia. It will continue to pay its vendors and employees in full, it said in a news release.
Guitar Center said it had struck an agreement with its creditors in support of a plan that would reduce its roughly $1.3 billion in debt by $800 million. To help support its bankruptcy, it said it had secured new financing from investors that include a fund managed by its current owner, the private equity firm Ares Management Corp., as well as funds managed by the hedge fund Brigade Capital Management and the Carlyle Group, also a private equity firm.
The company said it expected to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of the year.
“This is an important and positive step in our process to significantly reduce our debt and enhance our ability to reinvest in our business to support long-term growth,” Guitar Center’s chief executive, Ron Japinga, said in a statement.
Guitar Center’s bankruptcy is the latest example of how the coronavirus pandemic has divided U.S. retail into two groups, with a growing gap between the strongest and weakest companies. Although many people turned to hobbies like playing music while homebound, the beneficiaries of that surge in demand have primarily been businesses with strong e-commerce infrastructure.
Even before the pandemic, Guitar Center’s business was threatened by online rivals like the website Sweetwater, and the company was heavily indebted as a result of a private equity-led buyout years earlier. Still, it said in a court filing, it had had 10 consecutive quarters of sales growth through the end of February. But, it said, the pandemic “wiped out much” of that progress. It missed an interest payment of roughly $45 million last month, putting it on the path to a bankruptcy filing, The New York Times previously reported.
Guitar Center had to close many of its stores across the country, with 75% of its stores shuttered at one point. The retailer later said that online sales blossomed during the pandemic, but what proportion of its business those sales made up is unclear.
It said in the court filing that its “significant debt burden and upcoming maturities, coupled with the economic upheaval created by the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic, could not be resolved through short-term measures.”
Guitar Center’s origins date to 1959, when its founder, Wayne Mitchell, bought a home organ store, the Organ Center. The rise of the Beatles a few years later helped persuade Mitchell to begin selling guitars and rename the business Guitar Center. The next few decades brought expansion and, in 1997, an initial public offering of stock.
The company was acquired by Bain Capital, the private equity firm, in 2007 for $1.9 billion. But like many such deals, the buyout left Guitar Center heavily indebted just as online rivals began to emerge. To reduce the debt load, some of Guitar Center’s debt was converted to equity, making Ares Management the majority shareholder in 2014.
Even so, Guitar Center continued to carry about $1.3 billion in debt as a vestige of the Bain takeover.
In filing for bankruptcy, Guitar Center joins a slew of other struggling retailers, including J. Crew, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney, which were unable to withstand the impact of the downturn during the pandemic. Some, like Neiman Marcus, have already emerged from bankruptcy protection.

The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency authorization for the experimental antibody treatment given to President Donald Trump shortly after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, giving doctors another option to treat COVID-19 patients as cases across the country continue to rise.
The treatment, made by the biotech company Regeneron, is a cocktail of two powerful antibodies that have shown promise in early studies at keeping the infection in check, reducing medical visits in patients who get the drug early in the course of their disease. A similar treatment, made by Eli Lilly, was given emergency approval earlier this month.
The emergency authorization for Regeneron’s drug is limited in scope: It is for people 12 and over who have tested positive for the coronavirus and who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19. Evidence so far suggests that antibody treatments work best early in the course of the disease, before the virus has gained a foothold in the body. Like Eli Lilly’s treatment, Regeneron’s is not authorized for use in people who are hospitalized or who need oxygen.
The emergency authorization raises immediate questions about who will get access to the treatments as an average of more than 168,000 people are diagnosed each day with COVID-19 in the United States and hospitals are running out of beds in some regions of the country. Regeneron has said it will have enough of the drug for only about 80,000 people by the end of November, enough for 200,000 patients by the first week of January, and 300,000 by the end of January. After that, the company said, it will be able to ramp up production thanks to a partnership with Swiss manufacturer Roche.
Regeneron has received more than $500 million from the federal government to develop and manufacture the treatments, a complex and time-consuming process. Although the first 300,000 doses will be provided free, patients may be charged for having the treatment administered; it must be infused in a clinic or hospital.
Antibody treatments have gotten less attention than vaccines, but health officials have long held out hope that they may serve as a possible bridge until a coronavirus vaccine is more broadly available. Two vaccines, one made by Pfizer and another by Moderna, were recently shown to be more than 90% effective in early analyses. Pfizer, which has completed its trial, submitted an application Friday for emergency authorization of the vaccine, and Moderna said it planned to apply soon. Still, it will be weeks before a vaccine is available, and even then, access will be limited to people in high-risk groups.
Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s president and chief scientific officer, said in a statement that he was encouraged by the recent vaccine results but that “there remains a need to treat patients who develop COVID-19, especially as some may not have had access to or were not protected by vaccination.”
Regeneron enjoyed a burst of publicity in October, when Trump received an infusion of its cocktail and then enthusiastically promoted the drug as lending him a superpower-like feeling. In a video released Oct. 7, the president claimed without evidence that it had cured him and that he had authorized it — something he does not have the power to do.
It remains impossible to know whether the Regeneron treatment helped Trump. He was given multiple drugs while at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and many people recover from the virus on their own.
Since the spring, White House and health officials have been closely watching the development of the antibody treatments. In addition to Regeneron’s deal with the federal government, Eli Lilly announced a $375 million deal in October to supply the government with 300,000 doses.
A similar antibody treatment that Regeneron developed to fight Ebola was approved by the FDA in October, bolstering confidence that its COVID-19 version would prevail in the ongoing trials of outpatients.
The president and two of his top advisers — Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law — have called Dr. Stephen Hahn, the FDA commissioner, to press for speed in agency reviews. And Dr. Leonard Schleifer, the billionaire co-founder and chief executive of Regeneron, who has known Trump casually for years, has told associates that Trump calls him to ask about the status of the treatment.
Early data released by Regeneron suggest that its cocktail works best in people who do not appear to be mounting an early immune response to the virus, or who have high levels of the virus, and who are therefore at greater risk of faring poorly.
But early evidence also shows that the antibody treatments do not work well once people are sick enough to be hospitalized. Eli Lilly stopped giving its treatment to hospitalized patients in a government-run trial because, it said, it did not seem to be helping those patients. And Regeneron paused enrolling the sickest hospitalized patients in one of its trials.
This causes a challenge for distributing the drugs, since they are only authorized for people who are not hospitalized yet must be infused intravenously in a clinic or hospital.
Regeneron has suggested that the people who benefit the most from the treatment are those who have not yet mounted an antibody response and who also have high viral loads — but learning who those people are would require separate tests that are not routinely given to patients who test positive for the virus. Company executives have acknowledged that at first, such tests may not be available, and the emergency authorization notes that people at high risk include those who are over 65 or have underlying conditions such as obesity or diabetes.
Getting the treatment to the right people will require quick turnarounds in testing, as well as coordination among federal, state and hospital officials — many of the same challenges that have complicated the U.S. response to the pandemic.
The distributor AmerisourceBergen will deliver Regeneron’s treatment on a weekly schedule based on the number of COVID-19 cases in each state. The federal government plans to work with state health officials to determine which hospitals and clinics should receive it.
In a call with reporters this month to outline how the Eli Lilly treatment would be distributed, Janet Woodcock, a top federal drug official, said the administration was working with hospitals and infusion companies, and acknowledged the logistical complexity of a drug that takes an hour to administer, followed by an hour of observation. The hospitals and clinics will also have to figure out how to safely treat infectious patients without exposing other people to the virus.
“We’re all going to need to get the word out that people at high risk have a therapeutic option now as outpatients, because until this point people have been told to stay home unless they get very sick,” she said.
The emergency use authorization, or EUA, was previously an obscure corner of regulatory law that mostly escaped broad public attention. But during the pandemic, it has become a centerpiece of the administration’s health policy: Since February, the agency has granted hundreds of emergency authorizations related to COVID-19, many for diagnostic tests and others for personal protective equipment, blood-purification devices, ventilators and therapies.
In signing off on the emergency authorizations, FDA scientists in the agency’s Office of Infectious Diseases had to weigh the need for clear evidence that the treatments worked with the increasing desperation for useful drugs as the pandemic accelerated again in the United States. Unlike a full FDA approval, which requires a rigorous vetting of clinical trial data showing a drug is safe and effective, an emergency authorization simply requires the potential benefits of a drug to outweigh its risks.
The emergency authorization for Regeneron may still have the unintended effect of complicating the role of clinical trials in proving the treatment’s effectiveness for different age groups. If the drug becomes available more broadly, fewer people may want to sign up for clinical trials and risk the possibility that they may receive a placebo.
Regeneron’s clinical trials are continuing in hospitalized patients as well as in studies looking at whether the treatment can prevent infections in people who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19.

Texto completo: Wear your blank, watch your blank, and blank your blanks. At this stage of the pandemic, does anyone need help filling in the blanks of the simple steps we all can take to curb the spread of the coronavirus? And yet, it appears enough of us just aren't taking them.
As coronavirus cases have soared, Gov. Eric Holcomb and state and local health officials have repeatedly implored Hoosiers to adopt these basic public health practices, along with avoiding large public gatherings and staying home if you feel ill.
One need only look at coronavirus numbers to see the message may still not be getting through to many. Since the start of October, the number of people in Indiana infected has soared from below 15,000 to more than 70,000, according to the Regenstrief Institute, an Indianapolis research organization. Nearly twice as many people are hospitalized for COVID treatment today in the state's hospitals as were hospitalized during the peak in the spring.
On Wednesday Holcomb invited three Indiana hospital executives to appear at his weekly coronavirus news briefing and issue their own plea to the public to, yes, do all those things – wear masks, watch distances and wash hands.
Public health experts say they are not surprised that despite repeated pleas to people to do the right thing, too many people just, well, don't.
Several factors may explain why Holcomb and others have reminded people again and again to make these behaviors second nature, public health experts say. People often take the lead from what they see others doing, be those individuals national leaders or their neighbors. People need consistent messages that leave no doubt about the best course of action. And, in many instances, they need laws or policies to ensure they do what they are asked.
History has taught us that it can take decades for people to adopt public health behaviors, said Monica Kasting, an assistant professor in Purdue University's Department of Public Health.
"Just saying that people should do it without any enforcement hasn't worked for any public health practice that we see," she said. "Just hoping people do it is not going to work."
Making the
unhealthy choice
the hard choice
Consider seat belts. At first people fought back when public health officials first started recommending everyone buckle up in cars, she said. Eventually after years, the idea became widely accepted and entrenched in the law to the point where failing to do so can result in a ticket and a fine.
For the most part, people understand and accept the wisdom of following these behaviors, Kasting said. But that doesn't mean they necessarily do. Encouraging people to opt for preventive healthy behaviors can prove a challenge.
"What you have to do from a public health perspective most of the time is to make the healthy choice the easy choice and the unhealthy choice the hard choice," said Kasting, who added that she would like to see Holcomb enforce the state's mask mandate.
The more distant a threat seems, the less likely we are to act, she said. The more immediate a threat, the more likely we will respond. People are more willing to be tested for a disease than they are to engage in behavior to prevent it; for instance, people are more likely to agree to be screened for cervical cancer than they are to be vaccinated against it., she said.
In a similar vein, while people may still not follow the public health measures to stop the spread, once they fear infection, they will go for testing.
"People are much more willing to catch a disease early through screening and testing than to engage in healthy behaviors," Kasting said. "It's hard to get people to have future-oriented thinking to do something that's inconvenient. It's much easier once they have a symptom to then address it at the time."
Sending a strong public health message requires consistent information, particularly at the national level, public health experts agree. The western countries that have controlled the virus better than others have leaders who have followed the science and repeatedly appeared in public wearing masks, said Dr. Gabriel Bosslet, a pulmonologist at the Indiana University School of Medicine and the Hoosier behind the Hoosier COVID-19 Update, a Facebook page on which he tracks the virus.
In the wake of 9/11, Americans came together to help the nation heal, he said. Americans had a shared enemy: the terrorists. The nation's leaders could have spurred people to do something similar during the pandemic, uniting in our actions to keep the virus at bay. Instead, people are split on how to respond.
"Rather than leaders having chosen to make the virus the other," Bosslet said, "they have made other humans the other. We all should be pointing at the virus together and yelling at the virus."
How behaviors increase risk
Just as there has not been unity in attacking the virus, states have taken a variety of approaches to policy aimed at lowering spread. A recent New York Times report found that states that had the least restrictions now are experiencing the worst outbreaks.
Indiana came in 18th in the ranking of states going least to most restrictive. Indiana is among eight states with the greatest number of current hospitalizations per 100,000 people, and only 10 states have more cases per 100,000 than Indiana, according to the New York Times analysis.
In Indiana, people have been going out and about more than they have in other parts of the country, research by a consortium of professors from different universities found. The group, behind a project known as A 50-State COVID-19 Survey, has been exploring people's behaviors and how those are changing over the course of the pandemic.
The survey found that more people in Indiana are going to work, the store and visiting friends than people in the country as a whole are, said David Lazer, the website's co-lead and a professor of computational social science at Northeastern University. When it came to visiting bars, Indiana was way above average – no doubt aided by the fact that in some other states bars may have had more restrictions placed upon them.
"It does seem to be in a systematic fashion that folks in Indiana are behaving in a riskier fashion," Lazer said.
The fact that Hoosiers have the capability of going out also may decrease the likelihood that they will follow those public health recommendations that officials have pushed again and again.
Keeping bars and restaurants open while encouraging people to socially distance makes little sense, public health experts say. Such settings lend themselves to intimate social interactions that basically require people to lean close. Eating and drinking require people to lower their masks. Consuming alcohol can impair one's judgment.
Having bars and restaurants open, even at reduced capacity, sends a message that the situation is not all that dire.
"Clearly if you can go get a beer and hang out in a bar, how serious can it be," Lazer said. "It does send a message that it's not so serious. ... If you can get together in a restaurant, surely you can get together with your friends in your home."
The answer lies not in merely closing such establishments but in also finding ways to subsidize the owners so that the decision does not pit public health against people's financial well-being, many experts agree.
Why a local approach might work better
Whether businesses are open or closed, there are better and worse ways of communicating the basic steps one can take as an individual to persuade people to change their behaviors. For many people, pandemic fatigue has set in, making it more difficult for officials to convey the message, said Ana Bento, assistant professor at Indiana University's School of Public Health.
Policies targeted for specific counties, as Holcomb has encouraged, may resonate more with individuals, especially if big announcements accompany any change in policy, Bento said. People may be more inclined to follow recommendations that come at the county level because they will view the threat as more immediate.
If the same announcement comes from a higher-level official, "I may think this is a problem of my state, not my county," Bento said.
Other public health experts say that the most successful way to get people to change their ways is to reach skeptics not necessarily through policies but through friendships.
If people see people they know or celebrities they recognize recommending a set of actions, they may be more likely to adopt those behaviors, said Lindsey Leininger, chief executive officer of Dear Pandemic, a website run by an interdisciplinary team of researchers that provides information on the coronavirus.
People may not be as likely to listen to the medical establishment from on high as they might be to respond to a local school nurse or librarian, Leininger said. Finding the right person to send such messages is particularly important for states like Indiana, which has a mix of liberals and conservatives.
"It's going to take the right messenger for the place. ... That personal connection is more powerful than any one policy," said Leininger, a clinical professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, "To me, this is really the path forward."
Once the message is sent, however, the even more difficult task becomes persuading those who hear it to put it into action.
Solving this puzzle is an age-old conundrum for the field of public health because it can be so easy to rationalize not doing what the experts recommend – be that losing weight, exercising, undergoing colon cancer screening or taking steps to lower one's risk of contracting the coronavirus.
"I think people really believe these behaviors prevent the spread of the virus. The communication issue is getting them to do it and to understand the necessity of it," Kasting said. "They think it's an all or nothing – either we go back to sheltering in place or we don't. And they don't understand there's a middle ground. ... People really, really want to live in a black or white world, and we live in a gray world."

Texto completo: As the cold weather descends, warm your heart with a sports movie or get your blood pumping with suspenseful thrillers.
We've reached that time of year when the small screen is filled with Christmas movies, populated by happy folks in coats and scarves, frolicking in the snow. This will not be a list of those kinds of films. This collection is more for all of you who love the chilly weather, but who can't stand "Jingle Bell Rock."
Below, you'll find winter sports stories, icy outdoor adventures and intense dramas set in places so cold that the characters have no choice but to shelter inside -- however uneasily. Consider this list counter-programming for the holiday season, for when you're eager to stream something completely Santa-free.
'The Ice Storm'
Rent or buy it on Amazon Prime , Apple TV , Google Play , Vudu or YouTube .
This adaptation of Rick Moody's novel is set over Thanksgiving weekend in 1973, but it is in no way a "holiday movie." The director Ang Lee and the screenwriter James Schamus -- and a cast that includes Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Tobey Maguire and Christina Ricci -- concentrate on the subtle feelings of betrayal, arousal, loneliness and nostalgia, experienced by an upscale suburban Connecticut family and their neighbors, at a time when kids and adults alike seemed to be experimenting with recreational drugs and libertine sex. As these characters stumble through this new world, a literal ice storm transforms their surroundings, making every move more treacherous.

'Transsiberian'
Stream it on Amazon Prime , Peacock , Tubi or Vudu ; rent or buy it on Google Play or YouTube .
Something about the cold and snowy weather seems to lend itself to stories about trains, ones that snake their way through a forbidding wilderness. (See also: "Snowpiercer.") In "Transsiberian," two couples with troubled pasts meet on a train, speeding from China to Russia. The cramped spaces and the inhospitable outdoors create problems for these travelers, as they find it increasingly difficult to keep secrets from each other -- or from the shady characters who are on their tail. The director Brad Anderson makes great use of some real Baltic locations, staging white-knuckle action sequences in places that look like the edge of the world.

'A Simple Plan'
Rent or buy it on Amazon Prime , Apple TV , Google Play , Vudu or YouTube .
Frigid winter landscapes also factor into the plot of "A Simple Plan," a script adaptation by Scott B. Smith of his taut thriller novel and directed by Sam Raimi. Billy Bob Thornton and Bill Paxton play brothers who find a downed airplane and a sack of money in the Minnesota woods. Their previously placid lives are then violently disrupted as they try to figure out how to hold onto the cash. They quickly discover how hard it is to stay cool -- so to speak -- in a snow-covered small town, where each step leaves a mark, leading back to their door.

'The Hateful Eight'
Stream it on Netflix ; rent or buy it on Amazon Prime , Apple TV , Google Play , Vudu or YouTube .
Most of this leisurely western takes place indoors, at a remote Wyoming trading post, where an eclectic assemblage of outlaws and lawmen -- many of them veterans of the Civil War -- wait out a blizzard and stew over old beefs. An all-star cast (including Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Dern, Tim Roth, Kurt Russell and an Oscar-nominated Jennifer Jason Leigh) makes the most of the writer-director Quentin Tarantino's flavorfully vulgar dialogue, treating the material almost like a stage play. But Tarantino never lets the audience forget how harsh the conditions are outside, where the bitterly cold winds of a still-divided nation seep through the cracks in the walls.

'Miracle'
Stream it on Disney+ or Netflix ; rent or buy it on Amazon Prime , Apple TV , Google Play , Vudu or YouTube .
In the winter of 1980, millions of Americans cheered the U.S. Olympic hockey team as they skated to an improbable gold medal. "Miracle" dramatizes this inspiring victory, with Kurt Russell playing the coach, Herb Brooks, a thoughtful leader who convinced his players that if they put aside their old rivalries, fought through their aches and pains and played selflessly, they could beat anyone -- even the dominant Soviets. The film's director, Gavin O'Connor, emphasizes the story's Cold War backdrop not so much for political reasons, but to remind viewers that the United States was in a bleak place back then, in need of a little uplift and warmth.

Texto completo: READING Rachel Bloom's new book, "I Want to Be Where the Normal People Are," is not unlike watching a sketch comedy show. One chapter is a fairy tale about her past relationships; another consists of apologies to former roommates in the form of an epic poem.
There's an interview with her younger self (conducted by her even younger self) about her first TV writing experience, a casting breakdown of "Straight Men in Musical Theater" and reviews of Hollywood awards shows based on food, ambient temperature and the prevalence of shape-wear.
It's all of a piece with "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend," Bloom's four-season CW comedy-drama, which featured frank and hilarious musical numbers on Jewish princesses, stalking and mental illness in many genres.

"I'd say it's a pretty good representation of how my brain operates," she told The Times of the book's variety-show flavor. "It felt like I was putting daydreams on paper." The essays, safely couched in their clever framing devices, allowed Bloom to be brutally honest about everything from OCD to the toxicity of the theater world without getting self-serious. (Sardonic exclamation points abound!)
Bloom wrote the book before the pandemic forced the shutdown of her industry; she edited it after the birth of her daughter and the death of Adam Schlesinger, her friend and musical collaborator, from complications of COVID-19. She spoke to The Times about Schlesinger, open secrets and the book's bonus track.
--
How did you choose which format each chapter would take?
It was very organic. A couple times, I was just writing something as a straightforward essay, and I'd suddenly go, "I'm bored!" Switching it up made it more fun for me to write, and hopefully more entertaining to read.
The framing devices could have been a way to emotionally shield myself. But I try to overcompensate by being as bare and raw and vulnerable as possible. I hope people see me, and all the parts of me that I'm sharing. [Topically,] there's a lot of overlap with "Crazy Ex," but that's a character and not me.
--
One chapter is a script for a musical, with accompanying audio on your website. How did that come together?
I had to get out so much specific autobiographical stuff in a very quick amount of time. It's very specific and I have no idea if anyone will relate to it, but there's a delightful song, if nothing else. Like a cheesy, badly-done morality play for elementary schoolers, where everything is very on-the-nose. That was fun and freeing to write.
--
How did you record it during the pandemic?
The music was written by Jerome Kurtenbach, whom I've collaborated with many times. And it was produced by Jack Dolgen, also the executive producer of "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend" and co-creator of my first music video. He's built a COVID-safe recording studio in his back house, and it felt like old times. It's only me, singing every part. Which was cathartic, because sometimes I didn't have to worry about how I sounded because I'd be playing a dude who can't sing.
--
Why did you recount being bullied in your first TV writers room via an interview between your two younger selves?
I wanted to find a way to talk about that, as it was a very emotionally fraught time. That's just how my mind works. I'd always imagine talking to my older self. And I had a lot of imaginary friends growing up which, strangely, didn't come up in this book, I'm just now realizing.
--
You've talked about it before, but here you're in control of the story.
I think a lot of people have had experiences like that, but they don't have the freedom to talk about it. So I just hope it helps other people. I could have been way, way pettier. But it was important to me to not fall into the trap of just wanting to [crap] on people. Because I don't want to get anyone from my old writing staff canceled. I'm proud of myself for my restraint!
--
In addition to some behind-the-scenes tidbits about making "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend," you also pull back the curtain on awards-season absurdities.
As a kid, it was very exciting to watch the interviews and see all the outfits. But demystifying this insider-y Hollywood thing is important because the culture of the red carpet plays a huge part in how women and girls perceive themselves, and the gap between how we think they should look versus how we can actually look.
I'm thinking about my 13-year-old self who wrote down and organized all the tips in magazines about "how to get Jennifer Aniston's look." It's like, you won't get that, because Jennifer Aniston didn't do that. She was surrounded by professionals who styled her and did her hair and makeup for her.
--
Speaking of critiques, you mention the "huge cover-up of a New York Times article that was going to be Broadway's own #MeToo reckoning," which is quite the open secret in the theater world.
[Laughs] Interestingly, that didn't come up in my interview [about this book] with the New York Times.
I'm still really shocked about it. I talked to some Broadway friends about this, and one said that, had that article come out, it would've shut down half the shows on Broadway. I guess I won't name anyone because it's hearsay and I don't want to get sued for libel. But it's stunning that they could take down Harvey Weinstein, but they can't take down Broadway?
That says a lot about how insular it is. Even though it seems to be on the forefront of certain things, like giving non-white actors real opportunities. And then there are other things where it's just stuck in the '70s, with this culture of worshipping old-school, misogynistic, patriarchal toxicity.
There's a certain Broadway costume designer who has numerous accusations against him and he, as far as I can see, continues to work. And I, for the life of me, just can't reconcile the two.
--
As someone working on multiple stage projects -- a musical adaptation of "The Nanny" and an eventual "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend" production among them -- do you have any qualms about working in that world again?
Yes. Because I know it can be better, and that's exciting to me. I acknowledge the problems, but I have the status now to be able to get stuff made that can try to counter some of these problems.
--
It's beautiful that the book is dedicated to Adam Schlesinger.
A year ago, I was in the thick of writing this book, and if I was told, "Hey, a year from now, you're going to dedicate this book to Adam," I'd be like, "Why would I do that?" Again, in the fantasy of speaking with past me and future me.
When the world comes back, I want to organize some sort of tribute concert to him. We lost a f-- genius.
--
You were set to write the "Nanny" musical together. What's the status of that project?
Because I was going on maternity leave, I finished the lyrics for the bulk of the songs for Act I, and he was going to turn them into demos. The day before he started feeling symptoms, he sent me the demo of the opening number.
He, Jack and I had such a shorthand. We're in the process of finding a writing partner replacement. But musicals are slow anyway, it's not like we had any readings coming up. It's not like his show "The Bedwetter" with Sarah Silverman, which was actively about to go. I haven't heard any of the songs from that, but I'm so excited to someday see a new Adam show. And whenever "The Nanny" comes out, I'll share this demo, because it's amazing.
--
Lastly, you write about your love of L.A.-area amusement parks. Are you looking forward to returning, when it's safe, with your daughter?
Oh, my God, I'm so excited. The only thing I have to be mindful of is not to be too excited, where it turns her off. Like, I have to temper my excitement for the Matterhorn so it doesn't scare her, you know?

NEW YORK — Every night after her shift this spring, Bridget Queral would leave the hospital where she worked as a nurse to find her husband, Luis, waiting to walk her home. As they ambled through an eerily silent Central Park, Queral would shed the baggage from treating patients during the pandemic’s intense peak. The stroll became a highlight of the couple’s coronavirus routine, even with the lawns devoid of their usual crowds.
When the weather warmed and the virus, for the moment, waned, the sounds of instruments once again rippled through the heavy Manhattan air. “It was really emotional,” Queral said. “Luis describes it as a black-and-white movie turning to color.”
For many New Yorkers in late spring, hearing musicians performing outside again was a welcome sign of hope and resilience. Throughout the summer and into the fall, jazz tunes, in particular, have become a near-constant presence across the city’s parks, stoops and sidewalks. And that real-life soundtrack can make you feel like you’re walking through a vintage film by Spike Lee or Nora Ephron — not a city in crisis.
It’s easy to get swept up into the New Yorky romance of it all, until you remember that virtually all of the city’s 2,400 indoor performance venues have closed since the coronavirus outbreak, at the same time that concert tours have been canceled, putting countless musicians out of work.
Even so, these makeshift outdoor shows awaken a sense of connection that has been therapeutic for musicians and fans alike.
The communal catharsis reached a new peak on Nov. 7, when crowds descended on Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn to celebrate the call of the presidential election. Since June, the Prospect Park entrance plaza had served as the regular venue for Wayne Tucker and the Bad Motha’s, who were dutifully playing on that sunny Saturday.
As Tucker and his fellow musicians played to the champagne-popping throngs, “everyone had so much love for each other,” Tucker said. “I felt like a messenger delivering that feeling to people.”
The Bad Motha’s are well practiced at delivering relief. Several times each week, they serenade parkgoers with a mix of jazz classics, originals and reinterpreted pop hits in a tight fusion reminiscent of Weather Report.
Keeping in touch with fans over Instagram, the group of 30-somethings has thoroughly charmed the community: One frequent audience member likes to cheer the players on, individually, by name. Another fan, reeling from a breakup, said the band had reawakened her sense of attraction. Even the police, who might in normal times ticket musicians for using amplifiers without a permit, tend to cast a blind eye to any potential violations as they nod along to the beat.
This summer the Bad Motha’s started playing outside to feel the thrill of performing in company after months of playing at home by themselves and found that they could make a bit of cash as well.
Tucker, who had planned to spend nine months of this year on the road, had flown home from an international tour in March, expecting to leave again soon. As weeks stretched into months and no new gigs appeared, he began to miss performing with others, so he organized a day of busking in the park for his roommates, keyboard player David Linard , saxophonist Miles Tucker (Wayne’s brother) and some friends, bassist Tamir Shmerling and drummer Diego Joaquin Ramirez.
“We didn’t think we sounded very good,” Tucker said, but “it got a great response, and we decided to keep doing it.”
Tips for a typical set, gathered through Venmo and an open bass drum case, tend to exceed, ever so slightly, the $100 standard club gig might bring in, Tucker said. Split among five band members, it’s not much. His group has also been lucky enough to play at socially distanced birthday parties and small weddings, which tend to pay more, but are scarce. In his free time, Tucker has been helping other musician friends move out of the city that they can no longer afford. He estimates that about half of his performing community is gone.
“It’s something of a sweet and bitter situation,” said Jerome Harris, a bass and guitar player who has toured extensively with jazz greats like saxophonist Sonny Rollins and guitarist and composer Bill Frisell. Recently, Harris has participated in the weekly Prospect Heights Community Jam, which takes place on a stretch of Vanderbilt Avenue in Brooklyn that has been cordoned off for pedestrians and outdoor dining. While connecting with the community has been a joy, he said, that connection arises out of necessity.
In a survey published by the Jazz Journalists Association last month, 61% of jazz musicians said their 2020 income would be less than half of last year’s. And 73% of American jazz musicians said they had no live performances scheduled for 2021.
Serving as a board member of the Music Workers Alliance, Harris has been seeking aid and work opportunities for musicians, many of whom are self-employed. So far, the organization’s calls to extend Pandemic Unemployment Assistance have gone unheeded, as have local proposals for safe, outdoor performance opportunities, along the lines of what musicians have been organizing themselves.
Even music schools have limited chances for artists to play together. Kellin Hanas, a freshman trumpeter at Manhattan School of Music, has been organizing busking trips to Central Park to comfort friends from other schools who have grown lonely livestreaming rehearsals from separate practice studios.
Hanas, an 18-year-old from Wheaton, Illinois, can’t quite believe her new venue: “Central Park, holy cow! I saw this on the Disney Channel.” But as her fingers stiffen in the cooling air, she said, Hanas senses that these idyllic days are numbered.
In Harlem, Berta Alloway is likewise anticipating a wintertime end to the shows she has been hosting on Sunday afternoons in Riverside Park under the memorial to Ralph Ellison, the renowned local (and jazz fan) who wrote “Invisible Man. ”
A longtime booker who is known for reinvigorating St. Nick’s Jazz Pub, a Harlem Renaissance landmark, Alloway has been inviting a rotating cast of players to her outdoor spot around 150th Street.
Patience Higgins, a multireed player who has toured with the Duke Ellington and Count Basie Orchestras, among other acts, often headlines with members of the Sugar Hill Quartet. Vocalist Maxine Brown, whose songs “All In My Mind” and “Funny” topped the charts in the 1960s, is also known to appear regularly.
Each week at Riverside Park, older jazz fans arrive early in Access-A-Ride vans to secure spots on benches before neighbors pour out from the surrounding buildings, clapping and swaying along with the players and greeting one another between songs. One chilly Sunday last month, June Terry, a white-haired regular, was moved to dance to singer Karl Dixon’s rendition of “Route 66.” The dancing also kept Terry warm.
Alloway, known as someone who makes opportunity where there is none, is unsure of what the winter holds. “It’s going to make me sick to my stomach,” she said of the weather forcing an end to her series.
Both Alloway and Tucker plan to return to the parks in the spring, particularly if the pandemic continues to block indoor performances. In the meantime, the morale they provide to the public, and the tips they receive in return, will go on pause.
This is not a typical autumn in New York, but that song’s lyrics resonate as deeply as ever: “It’s autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love. Autumn in New York is often mingled with pain. Dreamers with empty hands, they sigh for exotic lands. It’s autumn in New York. It’s good to live it again.”

Arthur Imperatore, Founder of a Critical Ferry Service, Dies at 95

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
NEW YORK — Arthur E. Imperatore Sr., a bluff entrepreneur who parlayed a trucking fortune into a dubious ferryboat operation that grew to be a critical link in New York City’s transit network, died Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 95.
His death, at Mount Sinai Hospital, was confirmed by his stepson, Armand Pohan, who said Imperatore had suffered from progressive kidney failure.
Imperatore steered the ferry service, New York Waterway, through legal and financial straits and disputes with government officials. But he also reveled in moments of glory, when his boats rode to the rescue on Sept. 11, 2001, and eight years later, when a commercial jet splashed down in the Hudson River.
Imperatore, whose formal education ended at high school, did not set out to be a ferry tycoon. He started the service as a “loss leader” to promote the 2 miles of industrial waterfront property he had acquired on the New Jersey side of the Hudson, Pohan said.
The land, most of which lay in the town of Weehawken, had belonged to the Penn Central railroad. Imperatore bought it for $7.75 million in 1981 with the dream of turning it into a minicity in “the Greco-Roman tradition” called Port Imperial.
But Imperatore knew far less about the real estate business than he understood about transportation. Once he let established developers do the building, a less grandiose residential community took shape.
Imperatore had gotten rich in the freight-hauling business. A company he started in 1947 with four of his seven brothers, the APA Transport Corporation, had become one of the most profitable trucking companies in the country.
Restless and impatient, he considered all sorts of ventures and embarked on several of them. His notion of an amusement park along the riverfront did not fly. But his idea of relocating a professional hockey team to New Jersey did — only without him.
Imperatore bought the NHL's Colorado Rockies in the late 1970s with the intention of moving the team to an arena being constructed in the New Jersey Meadowlands. In 1982, the Rockies were renamed the New Jersey Devils and began playing at the new Brendan Byrne Arena in the Meadowlands. But Imperatore had sold the team by then.
“My dad never met a business he didn’t like,” Pohan said. “Like a prospector, he drilled many dry wells, and once in a while he hit a gusher.”
Few people thought Imperatore would be a winner in the ferry business. Some derided the venture as “Arthur’s folly.”
But he plowed ahead, docking a hulking old ferry at the river’s edge as a makeshift terminal. There, passengers would board smaller boats for the quick crossing to a pier he had bought in midtown Manhattan.
He delegated much of the development to real estate companies, said Richard Turner, the longtime mayor of Weehawken. Turner estimated that the value of the property Imperatore once owned, along with all of the condominiums, town houses and shops packed onto it, easily exceeded $1 billion.
New York Waterway gradually added routes to lower Manhattan from various docks along the New Jersey coast. Before the coronavirus pandemic sharply curtailed commuting, its fleet was carrying more than 30,000 passengers a day.
Two years ago, New York Waterway stirred up public opposition in neighboring Hoboken to its plan to move its boat-maintenance facility about 1 mile downriver. Hoboken blocked that proposal, despite the company’s heavy lobbying of Gov. Philip D. Murphy and threats that the service could not survive without making the move.
“He was a very tough, tenacious negotiator,” Turner said. “He wasn’t a poker player. If you crossed him, you knew it.”
Some of the company’s finest hours came in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, which destroyed the PATH train station beneath the complex. From that morning until well past dark, the ferries carried thousands of traumatized people away from the ruins.
The company received emergency contracts to keep providing a substitute for the inoperative trains. But federal prosecutors determined that New York Waterway had inflated its costs and overcharged for that additional service. In 2006, the company agreed to pay $1.2 million to settle the charges.
When a US Airways jet landed in the Hudson in January 2009 with 155 people aboard, New York Waterway ferries detoured to rescue the passengers who had evacuated the sinking plane.
Arthur Edward Imperatore was born July 8, 1925, in West New York, New Jersey. He was the ninth of 10 children of Eugene Imperatore, a grocer, and his wife, Teresa. He graduated from Memorial High School in West New York and served in the Army Air Corps during World War II.
In addition to Pohan, his survivors include his wife, Dr. Mei-Ling Yee-Imperatore; a son, Arthur Jr.; a daughter, India Imperatore; and eight grandchildren.
Imperatore temporarily lost control of about half of New York Waterway’s service in 2005 when the company flirted with bankruptcy. He struck a deal with William Wachtel, a Manhattan lawyer with no experience in the ferry business.
Wachtel vividly recalled the day Imperatore picked him up in “a really old Lincoln Town Car” and stopped at Zabar’s for bagels and lox on the way to a five-hour negotiation at Imperatore’s home. He said Imperatore ingratiated himself by speaking a little Yiddish.
In the years before he sold back his part of the business, Wachtel said, he came to consider Imperatore a close friend and mentor. “Many people felt he was a tormentor,” Wachtel said, “but in reality his need for perfection made it impossible for him to settle for anything less.”

NEW YORK — It was late afternoon in the North Woods of Central Park, and the sun was setting fast. Joshua Kristal, a photographer with a penchant for birds, was starting to feel despondent as he searched along the creek, looking for any movement. This was the third time he had traveled more than an hour from Brooklyn to see Manhattan’s newest celebrity bird: an ethereal and majestic barred owl.
Currently known as Barry, the owl has intense black eyes and elegant poufs of white feathers streaked with brown and gray. He looks like a perfect stuffed animal from a high-end toy store.
But Barry is also unusual. Although owls are typically nocturnal, he makes regular daytime appearances and has become something of a performer. Practically vogueing, he stares, preens and swoops into the shallow stream to wash and flick his feathers. Barry will turn his head 270 degrees right and left, and up, to check for his archenemy, the hawk. He plucks chipmunks with his talons and devours them, seemingly unfazed by adoring fans and the paparazzi, many of whom have already made him Instagram-famous.
Knowing all this made Kristal even more frustrated that he couldn’t spot Barry. “I was stewing, thinking: ‘What’s wrong with me? Why is everyone seeing the bird except me?’” Kristal said. “But then, all these people passed me and said, ‘Have you seen him?’ And I realized, in my quest to find the owl, I wasn’t the only one failing. And I’m a terrible birder.”
Barry the barred owl was first spotted Oct. 9 by a group of devoted birders including Robert DeCandido, a New Yorker who has conducted bird walks in Central Park for some 32 years and is known as Birding Bob. The owl was an overnight sensation, not as flamboyant as the Mandarin duck two years ago but no less magnetic. Birders flock from all over for a chance to see Barry.
Owls are more common in the city than people realize, and they have been spotted in every borough, DeCandido said. Just last week, another owl, perhaps a stowaway from upstate New York, was found in the newly arrived Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. In Central Park, though, only one or two owls are usually spotted in a year, DeCandido said, and Barry is believed to be the only one there at the moment.
Barry most likely flew in from the north for a warmer temperature in which to hunt, but “only God knows,” DeCandido said. Barry is not nesting, as owls haven’t been found to nest in Central Park. He is roosting and putting on weight.
As social media bird alerts have become popular, there are more unique and rare birds reported in the city — like a recent sighting of a Virginia rail in Central Park, DeCandido said. “Before, if you saw something rare, who would you tell?” he said. “Now there is E-Bird and Manhattan Bird Alert, where bird sightings are reported almost immediately.”
But there are disagreements among birders on how healthy it is for humans to be stalking Barry, some using recorded bird calls to lure him out, surrounding him (at a respectful distance) and brandishing their cellphone cameras to capture the perfect image of a creature that typically does not like to be bothered.
Kristal learned of the owl from Manhattan Bird Alert, a Twitter feed that posts bird sightings throughout the city. When a Barry alert goes out, dozens of people show up, and fast. Therein lies the problem, said Dennis Hrehowsik, president of the Brooklyn Bird Club. Owls are much too sensitive to be thronged, he said.
“I haven’t gone to see an owl in years,” Hrehowsik said. “If I hear about it, I won’t go. It doesn’t need the added stress. Owls are special. They look different, they act different, they seem magical.”
Of course, this is why humans are drawn to them. As for the interest in photographing Barry, Hrehowsik said he was concerned that the owl, rattled by the activity, “will leave and try to migrate before it has enough sustenance.”
Birding in the city has grown more popular during the coronavirus outbreak, said Hrehowsik, who has led hundreds of bird tours. The quiet, meditative search for special birds — as many as 300 species of which live and migrate through New York City — can be soothing. And it’s a fresh-air activity, a key detail when it comes to safe pandemic pursuits.
Last weekend, Wendy Iraheta, of Harlem, waited patiently with her camera for well over an hour to see Barry; her friends had waited for hours longer. She said her quest to see him had become “an obsession.” Iraheta, in business development and marketing, said she visits often. She had posted a video of the owl preening and was really proud of it.
“It melts your heart,” she said. “It’s pretty much one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen.”
Janet Lee, a novelist from Harlem, was wandering nearby, craning her neck to look into the trees. She said she was yearning for another glimpse. “Those eyes!” she said.
Coming upon an owl accidentally is a great thrill, most bird lovers would agree. But publicizing the location of sensitive species, Hrehowsik said, is not ethical bird-watching.
David Barrett, who runs Manhattan Bird Alert, said he did not think observing the owl stressed it. He defended his practice of alerting people.
“This is the information age; people can report what they see,” Barrett said. “You don’t get owls every day in Manhattan. In the middle of a city like this, it’s a reminder that there is mystery and beauty in nature, and we need to go see it.”
DeCandido said that the Brooklyn Bird Club was wonderful in the work it does but that it guarded the location of birds jealously. “They’re like the Mafia,” he said. “They keep things really secret.”
Other birders, meanwhile, have taken issue with DeCandido’s techniques to lure Barry into the open by using recordings of owl hoots.
DeCandido said he was simply bringing humans and birds closer together. “The more people see this, the more they’ll like owls, and the less they’ll want ice-skating rinks and things that reduce what owls need, which is woods.”
Kristal, the photographer, was not aware of the tense opposition; he just wanted to see Barry. So, after his third failed solo attempt, he paid $10 to go on an owl walk with DeCandido.
That did the trick. After 45 minutes, Barry swooped in and landed on a branch.
“It was exhilarating,” Kristal said. “I felt like I was cheating, because I wanted to find it on my own. But I had to see that owl.”
Although some birders think Barry is a female, DeCandido is convinced that Barry is a guy that answers the owl call because he is looking for a girlfriend.
“Owls have to meet people too,” DeCandido said.
It’s not known if Barry will remain. If he doesn’t find a mate, he might decide to stay the winter anyway, DeCandido said, since food — certainly in the form of rats and chipmunks — is plentiful.
Or he might head to the suburbs, DeCandido continued. “He might decide, ‘This ain’t the place to meet women; I’m moving to Jersey City.’”

Cities, states and counties from Massachusetts to Colorado have imposed curfews on residents and businesses to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus as caseloads reach new highs around the country.
The curfews, enacted by Republican and Democratic leaders, now affect residents in two of the country’s biggest states. In California on Thursday, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered “a limited stay-at-home order” in dozens of counties, barring “nonessential work and gatherings” from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. And in New York this month, Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered bars, restaurants and gyms to close by 10 p.m.
Some cities, like Newark, New Jersey, have taken a more targeted approach, setting a curfew for residents in ZIP codes with soaring case numbers; and leaders in Europe have made similar moves, like a 10 p.m. curfew for pubs and restaurants in England.
But the patchwork response, with rules sometimes varying from town to town, also has some residents asking, what effect could a curfew have on a virus that seems to be everywhere, spreading day and night?
What’s the point of a curfew?
Nicholas Gradisar, the mayor of Pueblo, Colorado, said his city’s curfew aimed to decrease mobility among those with the highest infection rate in the state, ages 20 to 50, who are also most likely to be out late at night. The city had a severe spike in cases after Labor Day and imposed a curfew the night before Halloween to try to prevent a similar increase. It was recently extended to Nov. 27.
“The rules for when bars are open are supposed to be that you can come down with your group and you don’t interact with others,” Gradisar said. But people are less likely to do this after a few hours of drinking, he added. “That’s how this virus spreads.”
Governors have given similar reasons for asking residents to stay home at night except for essential needs like groceries, framing curfew measures as a compromise between a full lockdown and keeping businesses open.
Dan Tierney, the press secretary for Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, where a 21-day curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. was instituted starting Nov. 19, said the governor had considered closing bars, restaurants and fitness centers altogether. But the economic impact would have been too damaging, Tierney said.
Instead, he said, the hope is that the curfew, combined with the statewide mask mandate and social distancing, will encourage people to reduce their contact with others.
“We think we can make a dent in these numbers by doing what we’re doing,” he said.
Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts said at a news conference this month that the state’s stay-at-home advisory was meant to “reduce the number of opportunities and activities where people gather in groups and get them home with only members of their household.”
In California, counties with severe outbreaks will have a curfew beginning Saturday. Dr. Mark Ghaly, the secretary of California health and human services, said the state’s order was meant to “target activities that are particularly high-risk,” like eating and drinking inside restaurants.
“We’ve seen in the past that COVID goes from zero to 60 miles per hour very quickly,” he said at a news conference Nov. 19.
What can go wrong?
While authorities hope curfews reduce transmission, their enforcement abilities are limited. Some bar patrons, for instance, may gather in homes after a few hours of drinking — and at-home gatherings of any kind would be difficult to prevent.
“These are best guidelines, so we’re not expecting police to go knocking on people’s doors or anything Orwellian like that,” said Tierney, the Ohio press secretary. “We’re hopeful that Ohioans will do what they need to do.”
And though the curfews are meant to be more economically palatable than full lockdowns, some businesses that depend on late customers expect to take a hit.
“It’s going to have an immediate effect on our revenue,” said Jeff Castleberry, owner of Caz’s Pub in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where the governor recently set a curfew. Castleberry said that the bar installed a filtration system and has taken fewer customers as a safety precaution but that losing late business will cut deep.
“We’ve been trying to operate in the right, and operating that way has cost us about 25% of our revenue,” he said. With the curfew, he anticipated, “we’re going to lose half of that 75%.”
Do the curfews work?
Gradisar, the mayor of Pueblo, said there wasn’t enough data yet to show whether the curfew has helped. He said that cellphone usage data, analyzed by the Colorado Department of Health, has demonstrated decreased mobility between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.
“You say, ‘Don’t have private parties; don’t have Halloween parties,’ but that’s nearly impossible to enforce,” he said. “At least we’re breaking up the parties a little earlier.”
But like cities around the country, Pueblo has had a significant increase in cases. Given this spike, Gradisar said he and other local officials were “desperate to try anything at this point.”
Health experts said it was not clear how effective curfews could be. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said that while curfews might have a “modest impact,” they should be “considered as part of a whole series of interventions” that need to be sustained.
“There are no quick fixes here,” he said.
Dr. Helen Boucher, an infectious disease specialist at Tufts Medical Center, said that because mask mandates, curfews and rules against gathering indoors are being put in effect together, it will be difficult to determine which made the biggest difference.
“If we see benefits in a month, was it one of them, or was it all of them?” she said. “It’s hard to ascertain. This is not a controlled trial. This is real life.”
Dr. Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, called curfews a “crude, inelegant instrument” being used to address a problem without a simple answer.
“In many places, it’s small gatherings at home,” he said of transmission, describing a scenario with “four of us having dinner, and none of us assumes we have COVID.”
Gonsalves said the curfew measures, combined with other measures, were “a logical approach” borne out by practical experience in the United States and across the world. “We’re doing what seems to reduce contacts.”
But he said that leaders’ efforts were suboptimal, if understandable, given their compromised position. People are weary of isolation, and the cost of giving up social ties this holiday season is high. Workers at bars, restaurants, gyms and other businesses need economic support, but Congress has signaled that another stimulus package is unlikely before year’s end.
“It’s really like putting a Band-Aid on a machete wound,” Gonsalves said. “It’s not about Republican or Democratic governors. They’re all in the same boat. They’re not getting support. Faced with the onslaught, mayors and governors would love to do more. But they can’t do more.”

An Unlikely Thanksgiving Tradition Carries On

Four years ago, Wanda Dench didn’t know her grandson had changed his phone number when she invited him to her house for Thanksgiving dinner at 3 p.m. sharp.
First there was confusion from the apparent stranger on the receiving end of the text, then an exchange of selfies.
“You not my grandma,” texted Jamal Hinton, then a 17-year-old high school senior. “Can I still get a plate though?”
“Of course you can,” Dench, now 63, of Mesa, Arizona, responded. “That’s what grandma’s do … feed every one.”
Thus began a holiday tradition that has charmed the world. Hinton tweeted photos of their exchange, promptly drawing the internet’s attention; Dench received so many requests for plates that year that she had to change her number. A few weeks later, Hinton took Dench up on the offer, and the pair and their families celebrated that Thanksgiving together — and each one since.
Their holiday tradition has drawn attention every year, and Dench even has an entry as “Thanksgiving Grandma” at KnowYourMeme, the online database of the internet’s favorite moments. So when her husband, Lonnie, died of the coronavirus in April, it, too, made headlines around the country.
This year’s holiday will be different for Thanksgiving Grandma, as it will for millions of other people. Dench and Hinton weighed the risks of holding a Thanksgiving celebration during the pandemic. They wondered if they could find a way to celebrate together early in the day, before splitting off to see their respective families, but decided the risk of spread was too great.
With cases rising, states' officials and health experts have urged people to scale down their Thanksgiving celebrations; this week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to stay home. The director of the Arizona Department of Health Services said she expected to see a “significant increase” in the number of coronavirus cases after Thanksgiving, and the state, like others, has urged people to limit the number of guests, physically distance from one another and wear masks if they are going to celebrate even a modest holiday.
Instead of a large multifamily event, Dench and Hinton held a small dinner on Friday, where they gave thanks and talked about their friendship and Lonnie Dench’s death, Wanda Dench said. During their meal, they kept a burning candle and portrait of Lonnie Dench in front of his seat at the table.
“It’s going to be different, my first Thanksgiving without him,” she said. “My husband was always right behind me, telling me how proud he was of Jamal and me for what we’ve done.”
‘You Can Be Family With Anybody.’
Dench and Hinton’s chance encounter in 2016 blossomed into a deep friendship. They met up for frequent double dates, accompanied by Lonnie Dench and Mikaela Grubbs, 21, Hinton’s girlfriend. The couples once spent four hours at a barbecue restaurant laughing and talking about “everything imaginable”— their lives, jobs, favorite music, movies and the possibility of life on other planets, Dench said.
“After meeting her the first time I just knew, she’s another person, age is really just a number,” Hinton, who is now 21 and works as a car salesman, said of Dench. “It doesn’t matter, you can be friends with anybody, you can be family with anybody.”
Hinton, who said he had aspirations of becoming a sports agent, started a YouTube channel after his rise to fame, where he occasionally chronicles his life with his girlfriend, including some cameos by the Denches.
Their Thanksgivings have usually been spent at the Dench home, but last year — the one Dench recalls as her favorite — they spent the day with Grubbs’ family. “Gosh it was just a whirlwind of fun,” she said.
Dench met her husband when she was 20 and living in Idaho, an encounter she considers love at first sight, she said. They married a year later and had a daughter, in addition to two children from her previous marriage. They settled in Arizona to escape the cold and doted on their six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
“He was always true to himself,” she said. “He was the person I wanted to be like.”
Hinton said Lonnie Dench was always the first to pull people in for a hug or insist on a group picture. When the Denches upgraded their phones, Hinton spent the day helping to set them up. Afterward, he said, Lonnie Dench excitedly texted and called him to show him it worked.
“I always remember Lonnie looking at the bright side of things,” Hinton said. “He would want us to celebrate his life instead of hating COVID and hating everything.”
A Holiday Season Filled With Grief
As more than a quarter of a million people in the United States have died from the coronavirus, a collective grief has swept the country. In many households, the loss is personal and tangible: an empty seat at the dinner table; silence in moments once filled with conversation; confronting a holiday season emptier than those that have come before.
The first holiday after a loved one has died can be difficult, said David Kessler, a grief expert based in Los Angeles and author of the book “Finding Meaning.”
In March, Kessler started an online grief group that quickly grew to 20,000 members who had lost parents, partners and children. Some were alone for the first time in decades, cut off by the pandemic from the type of community support that can help people process grief, like neighbors dropping off a casserole or a friend stopping by to just sit.
“There’s something about grief that we sort of think we’ll handle it alone,” Kessler said. “So I urge people, it’s not going to be the same holiday. It’s going to be much sadder. It’s going to be much lonelier. It’s going to be more intense. Please connect, even if it’s with other strangers in grief online.”
The Denches both became ill with the coronavirus in the spring. Lonnie Dench died on April 5, with his wife of 42 years at his side.
The day after Lonnie Dench died, Hinton and Grubbs brought Wanda Dench takeout from their favorite barbecue restaurant. They also brought some puzzles and a flash drive filled with well wishes from fans around the world, strangers who told her they had her in their prayers and how she and Hinton had inspired them.
A Bit of Joy in a Harsh Reality
Four years ago, when Dench and Hinton first met, the country was going through a similarly turbulent time during an election year with heated racial tension, Hinton said. He thinks their texts offered a holiday reprieve from a harsh reality.
“It was something to show everybody, ‘Hey, we’re all still human, we’re all still together and we can all be friends,’” he said. He said he hoped the same message carries weight today.
Both Dench and Hinton think of those first texts as an act of fate. Hinton’s friendship helped her see light in times of darkness, Dench said.
“I’m just grateful that we are here, we are together,” Hinton said. “I don’t know what I would be doing for the holidays this year, last year or years before if I didn’t have Wanda in my life, so I’m just grateful.”

What Happened When a School District Banned Thin Blue Line Flags

In late October, administrators in a suburban New York school district told employees that some of their apparel was making students feel uncomfortable, and even threatened.
At issue were masks showing the so-called thin blue line flag that signals support for the police but has increasingly been used to display opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, which rose in opposition to racism in policing.
Wearing the symbol violated a district policy prohibiting employees from expressing political speech, officials said. The logo, a black-and-white version of the American flag with a single blue stripe at its center, could no longer be worn by staff members.
Days later, a group of employees of the district, in Pelham, New York, appeared at work wearing shirts bearing the word “Vote” and the names of Black people who had been killed by the police, prompting accusations of hypocrisy and political bias.
The resulting controversy has divided Pelham, an affluent and mostly white Westchester County town of about 12,000 people just north of New York City.
The tense debate exemplifies the political tinderbox that much of the United States has become, where an emblem on a mask or a patch on a sleeve can ignite a dispute that consumes a community.
At the center of the conflict is a symbol that has come to mean vastly different things to different people, a black, white and blue Rorschach test whose significance continues to shift amid a continuing national reckoning over racism and police violence.
“It made a lot of people upset here, obviously,” said Ralph DeMasi, a school safety coordinator who was told not to wear the flag. “Clearly a directive was given. One side followed it, while another side was allowed to express their views.”
Facebook discussions have grown heated. Neighbors staked out clear positions and lined up in the cold to speak at a public meeting. School employees and parents said they had gotten threatening messages as the district attracted national media attention.
“People are taking this hard line,” said Solange Hansen, a Black and Latina woman who moved to Pelham last year and whose teenage son is a student there. “All of a sudden, overnight, you see these blue line flags on people’s lawns. You see them in people’s businesses. And that makes it really hard for the people of color.”
On Friday evening, The Pelham Examiner, a local news outlet, published a letter written by a Pelham high school senior, Nadine LeeSang, that expressed support for the district’s policy and said that the flag reminded students of color of “racist experiences they have had” with law enforcement.
“Nobody was really talking about how students felt uncomfortable, and it was kind of being dismissed,” LeeSang, 17, who is Black and Asian, said in an interview. Her letter was signed by 15 other people, most of them also students.
The debate over the flag’s meaning has played out across the country, particularly after widespread protests this summer over police brutality and systemic racism.
An Ohio school district banned it after a football player displayed it before a game; a school in another Ohio district suspended students for carrying it onto the field. There were opposing rallies in a Massachusetts town where officials ordered the flag removed from fire trucks.
Those who support the flag say it has long been used to honor law enforcement officers who sacrificed their lives, and that it is not meant as a political statement.
“It signifies a memorial, a connection between officers killed in the line of duty and those who continue with their duties in the present,” said Carla Caccavale, a Pelham resident who has four children enrolled in district schools and whose father, a New York City Transit detective, was killed while trying to stop a robbery when Caccavale was an infant.
Caccavale has made sweatshirts honoring her father’s memory that include a thin blue line patch. Although she initially made them only for her family and another family, she has begun to sell them to support police-related charities.
When school staff members were told they could no longer wear the flag, her sweatshirts were included in the ban. She said the decision baffled her.
“You have to look at the intention of the sweatshirts,” she said.
But supporters of the district’s ban on the flag said the logo could not be divorced from its current context as a symbol for the pro-police Blue Lives Matter movement that sprang up in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.
The flag’s critics also say the image has acquired a racist connotation after being carried at demonstrations by hate groups, most notably a Charlottesville, Virginia, rally in 2017, where white nationalists staged a weekend of protests that turned violent.
“Now that you see this flag flown alongside this other flags and racist symbols, it’s very hard not to say, ‘Well, that’s a racist symbol,’” Annemarie Garcia, who has two teenagers enrolled in Pelham schools, said. “Even if that’s not what it meant to you originally.”
In recent months, the flag has become a more common sight at pro-police demonstrations around New York and elsewhere. It hung prominently behind President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, and the campaign has sold merchandise bearing the symbol.
DeMasi, the Pelham school employee who was told not to wear the flag, said that he did not connect it to white supremacists. But he acknowledged that it had become a political symbol.
“Obviously, you’ve seen caravans with the Trump flag in the back of pickup trucks and then the thin blue line,” DeMasi, a former police officer, said. “I think maybe people had a good intention, but it ended up giving the meaning of the thin blue line a black eye.”
But the ban on Caccavale’s sweatshirts provoked a ferocious letter from the president of the Detectives’ Endowment Association, a New York City police union, who accused Cheryl Champ, the district’s superintendent, of “perverting views” of students and turning them into “cop-haters.”
The letter touched off an onslaught of coverage by local and national media outlets, including Fox News, where Caccavale has appeared twice.
Much of the coverage has focused on Caccavale and the school board’s policy, to the frustration of some who said they feared that the concerns of nonwhite students were being ignored.
The school district would not provide details about the students who were involved, including the number of complaints or the ages of those who had filed them.
Garcia, who volunteers for the district, said she had heard multiple students explain their views about the flag to staff members but she declined to provide details, citing privacy concerns.
“You have adolescents who actually stood up and expressed their concern,” Garcia, who identifies as white and Hispanic, said. “And these are not adolescents who look like the majority of the kids in Pelham.”
At a school board meeting on Wednesday, Champ said that when she began to hear complaints about the flag, she researched it and concluded that it should not be worn. When she received complaints about the shirts that said “Vote,” she did the same, she said.
“I apologize for not enforcing this policy evenly at its outset, which I recognize created an appearance of being one-sided,” she said.
Several people who spoke at the meeting in support of Caccavale urged administrators to bring the police into classrooms and foster a discussion about the symbol.
Hansen rejected that suggestion, saying it ignored the feelings of children like hers, who would be threatened to see officers in schools.
“Why force that on our kids?” she asked. “If even one kid said ‘I am afraid of that symbol,’ isn’t that enough?”

Texto completo: The claim: After Joe Biden tried to 'destroy the life and reputation' of Clarence Thomas, he is 'in control' of SCOTUS, which will 'most likely' decide the election.
Long before Election Day, there was speculation that the result of the contest between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden would be determined by the U.S. Supreme Court.
In fact, amid the confirmation fight over Justice Amy Coney Barrett in September, Trump told reporters, "I think this will end up in the Supreme Court, and I think it's very important that we have nine justices," per USA TODAY.
Ted Nugent — the singer-songwriter and guitarist who has become a vocal conservative activist — recently posted about the election and the high court on Facebook. His post, though, focused on a different justice: Clarence Thomas.
"In 1991, Senator Joe Biden did everything in his power to destroy the life and reputation of Clarence Thomas, who was eventually confirmed to the US Supreme Court," the post reads.
"Today, Thomas is firmly in control of the SCOTUS majority, the defacto Chief Justice. The 2020 election will most likely be decided in the Supreme Court," the post continues. "Joe Biden, meet your new master."
The post echoes a tweet from Benny Johnson, another conservative activist who works for Turning Point USA, on Oct. 26.
Nugent and Johnson have not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.

It's unlikely the election will be decided by the Supreme Court
At this point, it's unlikely that the election will be decided by the Supreme Court.
Two and a half weeks after Election Day, all 538 electoral votes have been accounted for, leaving Biden at 306, Trump at 232, per USA TODAY. It only takes 270 votes to win, which means Biden has a cushion of 36 votes.
Trump has filed lawsuits in five states, with the following electoral votes: Pennsylvania (20), Georgia (16), Michigan (16), Arizona (11), and Nevada (6).
Biden is currently winning all five states by significant margins: Pennsylvania by 81,141; Georgia by 12,587; Michigan by 154,187; Arizona by 10,457; and Nevada by 33,596.
In any combination, Trump would need to have election results overturned in at least three of those states to surpass 270 votes.
Even if a lawsuit were successful, it's also not clear that it would impact enough votes to flip a state from Biden to Trump.
(In contrast, in 2000, George Bush held an unofficial lead of 1,784 votes in Florida.)
Will the Supreme Court ride to Donald Trump's rescue? Don't count on it.
Richard Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California-Irvine, told NPR earlier this month that Trump likely lacks a path to victory via the Supreme Court.
"Unless something new happens, I don't see a viable path for Trump to litigate his way out of an Electoral College loss," Hasen said.
A look at the lawsuits themselves also suggests they are unlikely to succeed.
Trump and his allies have filed 19 lawsuits since Election Day, per the New York Times.
They have had one victory, which resulted in a narrow category of ballots to be excluded from the count in Pennsylvania.
Another 13 of the 19 lawsuits have been denied, dismissed, or dropped.
What role does Clarence Thomas play on the Supreme Court?
Regardless of whether an election-related matter ends up in the Supreme Court, it's not accurate to say that Thomas alone "controls" the court's majority. Thomas is part of the 6-3 conservative majority. But he is not the chief justice. That title belongs to John Roberts.
It is true that of the eight associate justices, Thomas has seniority; he has been on the Supreme Court the longest — since 1991.
As for Roberts, he prefers to steers his court away from politics whenever possible, per USA TODAY.
During an appearance in New York City last year, Roberts said the court must decide cases "according to the Constitution and laws, without fear or favor."
"That’s necessary," he said, "to avoid the politicization of the court.”

What happened between Thomas and Biden in 1991?
In 1991, then-Senator Biden was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In that role, he presided over the confirmation hearings for then-Judge Thomas.
The hearings were marked by the testimony of Anita Hill, a law professor who accused Thomas of sexual harassment.
Thomas has denied the allegations and was ultimately confirmed in the Senate, 52-48.
Biden has faced widespread criticism for his handling of the hearings — but most critiques focus on how he treated Hill, not how he treated Thomas.
Biden has been condemned for his failure to stop attacks on Hill, his decision not to call additional witnesses who could have corroborated her testimony, and for his own questions, which had an "accusing, skeptical tone," per New York Magazine.
Around the time he announced his presidential run, Biden called Hill and expressed regret for his actions — though she said he stopped short of an apology.
Later in 2019, he said on "Good Morning America" that he had "apologized for it," and would "apologize again."
“I believed her from the very beginning, but I was chairman. She did not get a fair hearing. She did not get treated well. That’s my responsibility,” Biden said. “As the committee chairman, I take responsibility that she did not get treated well."
Thomas also revisited the matter in 2019, in a documentary. He never mentioned Biden by name, but criticized the "modern day liberal," per ABC News.
"I felt as though in my life I had been looking at the wrong people as the people who would be problematic toward me. We were told that, 'Oh, it's gonna be the bigot in the pickup truck; it's gonna be the Klansmen; it's gonna be the rural sheriff,'" Thomas said. "But it turned out that through all of that, ultimately the biggest impediment was the modern day liberal. They were the ones who would discount all those things because they have one issue or because they have the power to caricature you."
Ultimately, though, how Biden treated Thomas and Hill is a matter of opinion, not fact.
Our rating: Partly False
Based on our research, the claim that after Joe Biden tried to "destroy the life and reputation" of Clarence Thomas, Thomas is "in control" of the Supreme Court majority, which will "most likely" decide the election, is PARTLY FALSE.
Let's break that down. First, it's unlikely at this point that the election will be decided by the Supreme Court — at least three lawsuits in three separate states, impacting 10,000 or more ballots in each state, would have to succeed to change the outcome. Second, it's not accurate to say that Thomas is "in control" of the Supreme Court's majority — though he is part of the 6-3 conservative majority and is the most senior associate justice, he isn't the chief justice. Lastly, how Biden treated Thomas in his confirmation hearings is a matter of opinion — and is therefore neither true nor false.

Iowa is one of worst states for COVID-19 spread, studies say

Texto completo: Across the United States, states are facing massive surges in COVID-19 positive cases, resulting in hospitalizations and deaths. Even though the pandemic's impacts are widespread, Iowa stands out as a top COVID-19 hotspot – not just nationally, but globally.
To slow the spread, Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a mask mandate when people are indoors and unable to maintain safe social distance from non-household members for 15 minutes or more. Still this week, Iowa has seen record-high hospitalization and death rates due to the pandemic.
Here is how Iowa is doing according to these studies:
Forbes: Iowa in top 10
riskiest state to visit
As Thanksgiving nears, more people are deciding whether or not to travel for the holidays. In a recent list, Forbes said Iowa was a place to think twice about visiting, ranking the third highest risk state for COVID-19 spread behind South Dakota and North Dakota. In general, the list advises staying away from the Midwest for the time being: Iowa's neighbors, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Nebraska are also labeled high-risk locations.
Federation of American Scientists: Iowa 28th for daily COVID-19 deaths worldwide
Eighteen of the 50 worst global hotspots with the highest mortality worldwide are in the U.S., and Iowa is one of them: Iowa ranked 28th worldwide for daily COVID-19 deaths per capita over a week, according to an analysis by the Federation of American Scientists, which separated out data from U.S. COVID-19 cases by state. The Czech Republic, Poland and Italy ranked ahead of Iowa in this study — but Iowa still ranks higher than the United Kingdom and fellow Midwest states Indiana and Minnesota.
John Hopkins: Iowa 22nd nationwide for COVID-19 totals
Compared to other lists, data from Johns Hopkins on total positive cases and deaths from the virus shows Iowa as a middling state instead of one leading the pack. Iowa ranked 22nd nationwide with a total of 199,645 positive cases and 2,105 deaths Thursday — far below Texas, which lead with 1,094,392 cases and 20,353 deaths and California with 1,069,284 cases and 18,476 deaths at the top of the list.
But of course, keep in mind: Iowa has a much smaller population than the states which lead the totals. Other states, like South Dakota and North Dakota which outrank Iowa on most other studies weighted by population ranked 38th and 39th on the list of COVID-19 totals respectively.
CDC: Iowa worst in nation
for 'flu-like' illnesses
When it comes to flu season illnesses, Iowa leaves the rest of the country in the dust. Iowa is the only state with a "very high" rating in a study by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on state levels of Influenza-Like Illness, or ILI, activity. The next highest-ranking states — North Dakota, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Idaho — are in the 'low' rating; all other states have a "minimal" rating in the ILI activity level study.
The study is based on the percentage of hospital visits that are due to illnesses with flu-like symptoms, which includes COVID-19. The national average of ILI hospital visits is 1.5%, while Iowa's current percentage is 5.7%.
Washington Post: Iowa 4th in nation for highest daily reported cases per capita
According to a Washington Post analysis of the pandemic's spread, Iowa is fourth in the nation for highest daily reported cases per capita — just behind North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming at 129 positive COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents.
New York Times: 3 Iowa cities make top 20 hotspots
It's not just one city in Iowa with a massive outbreak. The New York Times compiled a list of cities throughout the country with the highest average daily cases in last two weeks: Cedar Rapids ranked fifth, behind cities in North Dakota and Illinois, with a daily average of 188.8 new positive COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents.
The Waterloo-Cedar Falls area had the 13th greatest outbreak over the timeframe, and Dubuque the 16th. Iowa tied with North Dakota, Illinois and Wisconsin for having three cities in the top 20 outbreaks list.

From 'HOLY BALLS' to New York Times

Texto completo: WAUSAU – She's a sneaker-wearing, hip-hop loving, policy-and-politics nerd who rocketed to internet fame after she was elected mayor of Wausau. l When she realized she won, Katie Rosenberg sent out a two-word tweet, "HOLY BALLS." It spread like a wildfire fueled by Santa Ana winds.
"HOLY BALLS" was a spark, and the political and social landscapes were ripe for it to ignite. Rosenberg, 36, learned about her victory a week after the April 7 vote. Results were delayed because of COVID-19 disruptions and political and legal maneuvering at the state level. The presidential election also was beginning to gear up, and political energy was crackling across the country.
After about 24 hours of Rosenberg's post, 5,000 Twitter users had liked the tweet and 800 had shared it. Bradley Whitford, an actor from Madison who appeared in "The West Wing," wrote "@katierosenberg's response today after being named Mayor-elect of Wausau is why I love Wisconsin." Eric Columbus, a former President Barack Obama appointee in the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, wrote: "In most ways 2020 has been miserable. But then there's the initial statement of the mayor-elect of Wausau, Wisconsin upon learning of her victory."
It was a wild start to a new, demanding job. And now Rosenberg is more than 200 days into her tenure as Wausau's leader and she's been dealing with unprecedented challenges alongside political problems as old as democracy itself. She's owned "HOLY BALLS," pinning it to the top of her Twitter feed. And she's attempting to harness the power of her internet celebrity to fight the pandemic in Wausau, energize residents to engage and vote, and promote progressive causes such as urging more women to get involved in politics, LGBTQ rights and racial justice.
It may be too early to judge how successful she will be as mayor. But it's clear that she is a leader unlike any other Wausau has seen.
'You have to put yourself out there.'
None of this comes as a surprise to anyone who knows Rosenberg. As the daughter of longtime City Council and Marathon County Board member Jim Rosenberg, she's been consumed with politics since she was in middle school.
She talked about that experience in a May 2019 interview with the Wausau Daily Herald after she first announced her candidacy for Wausau mayor, and said it spurred her to throw her hat in the ring.
"I guess what inspired me is that you can sit around and talk about these issues all the time, and you know, I love the horse race, too, but it doesn't really do anything until you show up to the seat," she said at the time. "You have to put yourself out there; you have to share your ideas. That's when you actually see the real work of governing and politics get done."
Rosenberg has been putting herself out there for more than 20 years. She was involved in Kids Voting USA when she was a 12-year-old in 1996.
As part of the program, she wrote an eight-paragraph story for the Wausau Daily Herald in which she interviewed Marathon County political party leaders and asked them to predict who they thought would win the election. There were no surprises: Former Marathon County Democratic chairwoman Marlys Matuszak predicted a win for incumbent President Bill Clinton based on "pocketbook issues likes taxes and jobs," Rosenberg wrote.
Kevin Hermening, a leader for the Marathon County Republican Party, predicted a Bob Dole win, arguing that Dole was running strong in states with a high number of electoral votes.
The article "was on my parents' refrigerator for a long time," Rosenberg said, laughing. Later, when she became an adult, she was asked to serve on the board for Kids Voting USA.
"I was super pumped," Rosenberg said. "I was, 'Oh, of course I want to be part of this.'"
Getting people interested and engaged in politics is an enduring theme for Rosenberg, on social media and in person. During the presidential election season, she tweeted constantly about going out to vote, becoming a poll worker and bolstering the profile of other young female Democrats in their campaigns.
Voter turnout was high in Wausau, but that interest was reflected in other cities across the state.
"I wanted 100% turnout," Rosenberg said. "I know that is, as the kids say, 'extra' of me, but that's kind of my goal. We had 87%, which is good."
But she adds, she was more encouraged by "thousands of new registered voters, many young, first-time voters." And she helped recruit 161 poll workers in the city of Wausau.
"That's a lot, especially when you realize that we have been relying on this older generation to be our poll workers since forever. I had a ton of high school students, which was great," Rosenberg said. "I had a lot of people who ... were like, 'I'm taking a day off from my real job to do this, because it seems cool.' Which, of course, I want democracy to be cool. Is that my statement, 'Make democracy cool again?'"
'She doesn't fit the usual profile.'
The spotlight on Rosenberg hasn't dimmed yet as she settles into her new role. Regional, national and at least one international media outlet have either profiled her or quoted her in larger stories.
She was invited to write an op-ed column for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The Journal Sentinel is part of USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin, which includes the Wausau Daily Herald, and the group regularly shares stories and sources. But she also was featured in a question-and-answer piece by OnMilwaukee, titled "Wausau mayor Katie Rosenberg emerges as a new voice in Wis. progressive politics."
More surprisingly, since Wausau typically isn't on the radar screen of East Coast editors, Rosenberg was quoted in stories in The New Yorker magazine ("The Battle to Count All of Wisconsin's Absentee Votes") and the New York Times.
Even a British newspaper, The Guardian, quoted Rosenberg in a piece headlined "Wisconsin battles rapid rise in Covid cases amid partisan disputes over safety."
You would be forgiven if you think the national reporters found Rosenberg by scraping through their Twitter feeds. But it's more complicated than that.
Because Wisconsin was pivotal in the election, reporters for newspapers and other outlets started paying attention to some of the trends that were happening in the Badger State's grassroots politics. And paying attention to politics in Wisconsin often led to Rosenberg.
Julie Boseman, a New York Times national correspondent who covers the Midwest and is based in Chicago, said Rosenberg popped onto her radar screen after Rosenberg was elected. It wasn't necessarily "Holy Balls" that attracted Boseman's attention, but it was part of it, she said in an email.
It was "in part because she doesn't fit the usual profile of what a Midwestern mayor is – she's younger, she's a woman, she's active on social media with a pretty unfiltered voice," Boseman said. "I do see her Twitter posts regularly and appreciate the little first-person glimpses into the day of a mayor of a Wisconsin city."
On the surface, it might seem the most surprising that Rosenberg ended up in The Guardian, a newspaper based in the United Kingdom. However, the writer of that story, Mario Koran, grew up in Marshfield, and his parents now live in Wausau. He's a contributing reporter for The Guardian US, and he is also a University of Michigan Knight-Wallace Reporting Fellow, living in Milwaukee and reporting on COVID-19 and issues facing children of color in Wisconsin.
Rosenberg was on his radar screen as he scanned the political landscape of the state, Koran said.
"I didn't know about Mayor Rosenberg's social media presence until after I interviewed her," Koran wrote in an email. "It's certainly unusual to see a small-town mayor with such an outsized social media following. ... I did get the sense during the interview that she was quippy and energetic, willing to think outside the box in her role as mayor, and social media might be one way she's gone about that."
'You have to have a little bit of sass.'
Before Rosenberg was elected mayor, she served on the Marathon County Board for about three and a half years, and before that, she served on the Marathon County Library Board. These experiences, she said, helped her learn how government works, and how to deal with the unwieldy bureaucratic machine of democracy.
Meanwhile, her professional career also informed her communication style and political viewpoints. She was a marketer for Eastbay/Footlocker.com.
"And it was marketing for teenagers, right? High school students," Rosenberg said. "So it's one of those things that you have to have a little bit of sass in order to get their attention. But it has to have substance, too."
Rosenberg has a philosophy degree from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and a master's degree in strategic public relations from George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.
Through it all, she also was honing her skills on Twitter, tweeting out jokes, selfies (almost always with a V-for-Victory or peace sign) and wry commentary on politics and policy.
She continued this as a Marathon County Board supervisor.
"I loved being a member of the Marathon County Board, because you are a member of this 38-person body," Rosenberg said. "And I could lob bombs at leadership all day. I could be sassy; I could amend things."
Now she's the mayor, and the leader at which other people are lobbing criticism.
"And I don't know if I really appreciate that sass," she said, laughing.
She already has had to weather her share of criticism. Her stance on mask wearing gets plenty of blowback, for example.
The City Council recently approved a resolution that would require people to wear masks in public if the state mandate is lifted. But there is no mechanism for enforcement.
"It's important that we all wear masks," Rosenberg said. "And if you've been paying attention for the last eight months, you know it. I don't love the resolution. Part of me wanted to take it off the agenda. I didn't want us to be talking about anything that wouldn't do anything. ... But I was advised that doing that might make me look even more tyrannical than I already was."
City Hall was picketed on the night the Council took up the resolution by people who say mask mandates are a violation of personal rights.
She also took political heat, she said, from people who were upset that she signed an executive order that banned carrying firearms at polling places on Election Day. "Social media went crazy," Rosenberg said. There were threats that she would be served with a legal injunction. That didn't happen, she said.
"I couldn't have poll workers walking in and saying, 'Am I in danger from people with guns and these militias?'" Rosenberg said.
A close observer will see a shift in tone on her own Twitter feed since she became mayor. There still is some sass, but it's softened a bit. And right now, as Wausau and all of Wisconsin contend with a raging COVID-19 pandemic, she's using the pulpit to continue to exhort residents to wear masks.
One recent example is a quote from an World Health Organization article: "Attempts to reach 'herd immunity' through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and unethical. Letting COVID-19 spread through populations, of any age or health status will lead to unnecessary infections, suffering and death."
But those messages are also mixed with takes on "The Mandalorian," declaring individual dogs as "good dogs" and highlighting the fact that Green Bay Packers' receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling flashed a V-for-Victory sign when he scored against the Jaguars on Sunday.
Time will tell where it all will lead her.

Texto completo: WAUSAU – She's a sneaker-wearing, hip-hop loving, policy-and-politics nerd who rocketed to internet fame after she was elected mayor of Wausau.
When she realized she won, Katie Rosenberg sent out a two-word tweet, "HOLY BALLS." It spread like a wildfire fueled by Santa Ana winds.
"HOLY BALLS" was a spark, and the political and social landscapes were ripe for it to ignite. Rosenberg, 36, learned about her victory a week after the April 7 vote. Results were delayed because of COVID-19 disruptions and political and legal maneuvering at the state level. The presidential election also was beginning to gear up, and political energy was crackling across the country.
After about 24 hours of Rosenberg's post, 5,000 Twitter users had liked the tweet and 800 had shared it. Bradley Whitford, an actor from Madison who appeared in "The West Wing," wrote "@katierosenberg's response today after being named Mayor-elect of Wausau is why I love Wisconsin." Eric Columbus, a former President Barack Obama appointee in the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, wrote: "In most ways 2020 has been miserable. But then there's the initial statement of the mayor-elect of Wausau, Wisconsin upon learning of her victory."
It was a wild start to a new, demanding job. And now Rosenberg is more than 200 days into her tenure as Wausau's leader and she's been dealing with unprecedented challenges alongside political problems as old as democracy itself. She's owned "HOLY BALLS," pinning it to the top of her Twitter feed. And she's attempting to harness the power of her internet celebrity to fight the pandemic in Wausau, energize residents to engage and vote, and promote progressive causes such as urging more women to get involved in politics, LGBTQ rights and racial justice.
It may be too early to judge how successful she will be as mayor. But it's clear that she is a leader unlike any other Wausau has seen.
'You have to put yourself out there.'
None of this comes as a surprise to anyone who knows Rosenberg. As the daughter of longtime City Council and Marathon County Board member Jim Rosenberg, she's been consumed with politics since she was in middle school.
She talked about that experience in a May 2019 interview with the Wausau Daily Herald after she first announced her candidacy for Wausau mayor, and said it spurred her to throw her hat in the ring.
"I guess what inspired me is that you can sit around and talk about these issues all the time, and you know, I love the horse race, too, but it doesn't really do anything until you show up to the seat," she said at the time. "You have to put yourself out there; you have to share your ideas. That's when you actually see the real work of governing and politics get done."
Rosenberg has been putting herself out there for more than 20 years. She was involved in Kids Voting USA when she was a 12-year-old in 1996.
As part of the program, she wrote an eight-paragraph story for the Wausau Daily Herald in which she interviewed Marathon County political party leaders and asked them to predict who they thought would win the election. There were no surprises: Former Marathon County Democratic chairwoman Marlys Matuszak predicted a win for incumbent President Bill Clinton based on "pocketbook issues likes taxes and jobs," Rosenberg wrote.
Kevin Hermening, a leader for the Marathon County Republican Party, predicted a Bob Dole win, arguing that Dole was running strong in states with a high number of electoral votes.
The article "was on my parents' refrigerator for a long time," Rosenberg said, laughing. Later, when she became an adult, she was asked to serve on the board for Kids Voting USA.
"I was super pumped," Rosenberg said. "I was, 'Oh, of course I want to be part of this.'"
Getting people interested and engaged in politics is an enduring theme for Rosenberg, on social media and in person. During the presidential election season, she tweeted constantly about going out to vote, becoming a poll worker and bolstering the profile of other young female Democrats in their campaigns.
Voter turnout was high in Wausau, but that interest was reflected in other cities across the state.
"I wanted 100% turnout," Rosenberg said. "I know that is, as the kids say, 'extra' of me, but that's kind of my goal. We had 87%, which is good."
But she adds, she was more encouraged by "thousands of new registered voters, many young, first-time voters." And she helped recruit 161 poll workers in the city of Wausau.
"That's a lot, especially when you realize that we have been relying on this older generation to be our poll workers since forever. I had a ton of high school students, which was great," Rosenberg said. "I had a lot of people who ... were like, 'I'm taking a day off from my real job to do this, because it seems cool.'

He's a contributing reporter for The Guardian US, and he is also a University of Michigan Knight-Wallace Reporting Fellow, living in Milwaukee and reporting on COVID-19 and issues facing children of color in Wisconsin.

She continued this as a Marathon County Board supervisor.
"I loved being a member of the Marathon County Board, because you are a member of this 38-person body," Rosenberg said. "And I could lob bombs at leadership all day. I could be sassy; I could amend things."
Now she's the mayor, and the leader at which other people are lobbing criticism.
"And I don't know if I really appreciate that sass," she said, laughing.
She already has had to weather her share of criticism. Her stance on mask wearing gets plenty of blowback, for example.
The City Council recently approved a resolution that would require people to wear masks in public if the state mandate is lifted. But there is no mechanism for enforcement.
"It's important that we all wear masks," Rosenberg said. "And if you've been paying attention for the last eight months, you know it. I don't love the resolution. Part of me wanted to take it off the agenda. I didn't want us to be talking about anything that wouldn't do anything. ... But I was advised that doing that might make me look even more tyrannical than I already was."
City Hall was picketed on the night the Council took up the resolution by people who say mask mandates are a violation of personal rights.
She also took political heat, she said, from people who were upset that she signed an executive order that banned carrying firearms at polling places on Election Day. "Social media went crazy," Rosenberg said. There were threats that she would be served with a legal injunction. That didn't happen, she said.
"I couldn't have poll workers walking in and saying, 'Am I in danger from people with guns and these militias?'" Rosenberg said.
A close observer will see a shift in tone on her own Twitter feed since she became mayor. There still is some sass, but it's softened a bit. And right now, as Wausau and all of Wisconsin contend with a raging COVID-19 pandemic, she's using the pulpit to continue to exhort residents to wear masks.
One recent example is a quote from an World Health Organization article: "Attempts to reach 'herd immunity' through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and unethical. Letting COVID-19 spread through populations, of any age or health status will lead to unnecessary infections, suffering and death."
But those messages are also mixed with takes on "The Mandalorian," declaring individual dogs as "good dogs" and highlighting the fact that Green Bay Packers' receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling flashed a V-for-Victory sign when he scored against the Jaguars on Sunday.
Time will tell where it all will lead her.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "This Is America" (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Nov. 5):
I agree with Roxane Gay; the last four years did a number on my faith also. But it also did a number on my involvement in political discourse, in a good way.
Four years ago, I cast my first-ever ballot in the United States after the long road to becoming a citizen. I was sure that I was part of making history, electing the first female American president. What happened next I never imagined.
Tears were shed with close friends as the Trump presidency became a reality, but something else changed in me. I started taking part in protests and marches; I subscribed to The New York Times; I joined two book clubs, one focused on reading work from diverse authors and the other focused on riots and social change.
I started donating to political campaigns (and now know the names of most senators), and through honest conversation with my mother-in-law managed to take two votes from Donald Trump this election. I am ready to continue the fight, and so are many more of us out there.

Texto completo: In two books, she described Sammy Davis Jr.'s negligent parenting but also celebrated the intimate moments she shared with him toward the end of his life.
Tracey Davis, who turned her often painful experience as the child of the entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. into a tale of reconciliation across two memoirs, died on Nov. 2 at her home in central Tennessee. She was 59.
Her ex-husband Guy Garner confirmed the death but said he did not know the cause.
In "Sammy Davis Jr.: My Father," written with Dolores A. Barclay and published in 1996, Ms. Davis described growing up with a frequently absent father well known for his workaholism and his nightlife exploits; the anger she felt over the years when reflecting on her childhood; and the ability she gained, toward the end of Mr. Davis's life, to forgive him and reconnect.
Mr. Davis died in 1990 at 64.
"I said things like, 'Dad, I always loved you, but I didn't like you that much,"' Ms. Davis told The Los Angeles Times in 2014. "He said, 'Well, I didn't like you that much either.' It turned out the air needed to be cleared."
Her second book, "Sammy Davis Jr.: A Personal Journey With My Father" -- written with Nina Bunche Pierce and published in 2014 -- quoted from conversations the two had during that period, when, Ms. Davis wrote, "my father became particularly nostalgic about the past."
In addition to attaining fame as a singer, dancer and actor, Mr. Davis led a much-scrutinized social life. He belonged to the crew of rakish midcentury celebrities known as the Rat Pack, which included his longtime pal Frank Sinatra, who was the best man at Mr. Davis's wedding in 1960, when he married Tracey's mother, the actress May Britt. Mr. Davis was Black and Ms. Britt was white, and their union brought applause from supporters of interracial marriage and bomb threats from others.
MGM announced plans last month to make a movie about Mr. Davis based on Ms. Davis's first book.
"I am thrilled to know my father's life, both private and public, will be brought to the big screen with this team of storytellers," Ms. Davis said in a statement when the deal was announced. "He and my mother, May Britt, took on the world, choosing love and compassion over hatred and bigotry, and I am a product of that decision."
Tracey Hillevi Davis was born on July 5, 1961, in Los Angeles. She grew up in Nevada in the region around Lake Tahoe, where her mother moved after her parents divorced. She graduated from California State University, Northridge, in the mid-1980s and married Mr. Garner in 1986. They divorced in 2001. Another marriage, to Jim Cotta, also ended in divorce.
Ms. Davis worked in advertising.
In addition to her mother, May Britt Ringquist, she is survived by two brothers, Mark and Jeff Davis; two children from her first marriage, Sam and Montana Garner; and two children from her second marriage, Greer and Chase Cotta.

Vox's Founder Is Departing for The Times

Texto completo: Lauren Williams, the website's editor in chief, is also leaving. The departures come against a backdrop of change in the digital media business.
Ezra Klein, a founder of the popular website Vox.com, is leaving the publication to become a columnist and podcast host at The New York Times, the latest high-profile departure from Vox Media during a wave of change in the digital media business.
Mr. Klein had already stepped aside as editor in chief to become editor at large in 2017, three years after he helped to start the site. The move allowed him more space to work on Vox.com's television and podcast efforts. He has also been a contributor to MSNBC and Bloomberg News, and has written opinion essays for The Times.
Lauren Williams, Vox.com's editor in chief, will also be leaving the publication to start a nonprofit to create a "new and different kind of Black news outlet," the company announced in a note to the staff on Friday. Vox Media plans to hire a new editor for its flagship site and has open positions for other senior roles.
Mr. Klein will join The Times in January to write columns focused on policy and to host an interview podcast.
"He helped set the standard for modern explanatory journalism early in his career, and he's been able to do it through virtually every medium," read a note from Kathleen Kingsbury, The Times's acting head of the opinion department, and Paula Szuchman, the head of its audio group.
After his years at Vox.com, Mr. Klein said in an interview, he "began to feel more burnt out and felt the desire to return to just being a journalist again."
Mr. Klein belongs to the generation of journalists who helped pioneer the vernacular of web publishing, and Vox.com was early to explanatory journalism, a genre that takes readers through complicated issues step by step. Through much of the 2010s, the growth of upstart publications like Vox.com and BuzzFeed suggested that traditional institutions, including The Times and The Washington Post, would wither.
"I think that analysis was pretty mistaken," Mr. Klein said.
Digital publishing, he explained, doesn't abide by zero-sum rules: Readers of one publication may also read hundreds of others.
"The idea that these digital-native publication were somehow going to destroy what came before them was always ridiculous," he said.
The departures of Mr. Klein and Ms. Williams come as a blow for Vox Media, which has made big bets on boldface names in journalism. In addition, Matthew Yglesias, another co-founder of Vox.com, announced his departure this week, to start a newsletter at Substack, a subscription platform. In his return to blogging, Mr. Yglesias has weighed in on a possible Biden cabinet, the Disney+ show "The Mandalorian" and why McDonald's puts pickle slices on the burgers included in Happy Meals.
The tech reporter Casey Newton left The Verge, Vox Media's technology site, this year to start his own Substack newsletter. Kara Swisher, another Vox Media star, remains part of the company, but joined The Times as an opinion columnist in 2018 and this year has started hosting a Times podcast, "Sway." She still manages the annual Code Conference, which is owned by Vox Media. (I used to work for Ms. Swisher and was an employee of Vox Media.)
Last year, Vox Media acquired New York Magazine in a deal that signaled the start of a consolidation wave in digital media. Several high-profile mergers followed shortly thereafter: Vice Media bought Refinery29; Group Nine merged with PopSugar; and on Thursday, BuzzFeed announced its purchase of HuffPost.
Jim Bankoff, the Vox Media chief executive, said the company was now in a position to withstand the loss of key employees. "All the Vox Media brands are well past the point where they are about individuals," he said in an interview. "By themselves, each site is a massive, mainstream, modern media brand that touches tens if not hundreds of millions of people across every conceivable platform."
He said several Vox sites, including The Verge and Eater, continued to grow after their founders had left. And he suggested that Vox Media may get bigger.
"In a consolidating market, we're going to act strategically," he said. "We look forward to any opportunities as they come up in 2021."

Republican leaders need to tell Trump it's over

Texto completo: Where is our Barry Goldwater? Our John Rhodes? Our Hugh Scott?
As President Trump becomes more and more detached from reality, it is past time for him to hear directly from senior members of his own party that he must accept his loss to President-elect Joe Biden and participate in a peaceful transfer of power.
Trump needs to hear this directly, not via a concerned tweet here and there. Republicans cannot deliver the message by cluck-clucking to the media behind a cloak of anonymity. Instead of stepping up to the national interest that beckons, they have indulged the president's narcissism and abetted Trump in spreading unhinged conspiracy theories that claim the election was stolen.
And what has that done? It has encouraged Trump to become more and more reckless, more and more lawless, to the point where he is putting the arm on Republican officials in Michigan, Georgia and elsewhere to overturn the will of voters in their states.
On Friday, Michigan legislative leaders Mike Shirkey and Lee Chatfield were summoned to the White House. Reports have it that Pennsylvania officials will be next.
It is a subversion of democracy unlike anything we have ever seen. And it demands a response from the president's own party, on the order of what happened late Wednesday afternoon, Aug. 7, 1974.
This was at the height of the Watergate scandal. The Supreme Court had unanimously ruled that President Richard M. Nixon must surrender to Congress incriminating White House audio recordings that revealed his obstruction of justice. So deep was Nixon's denial that his initial impulse, against the advice of his own lawyers, had been to defy the court.
On that afternoon, a small delegation traveled from Capitol Hill to the White House. The members were Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who had been the 1964 Republican presidential nominee; his fellow Arizona Republican, House Minority Leader John J. Rhodes, and Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, who led the Republican Senate minority.
Their message: It was time for Nixon to resign.
This, in the end, was what it took to make Nixon face reality. As the New York Times later wrote: "He resigned his office not out of acknowledgment that he had failed, as the House Judiciary Committee charged, to live up to his constitutional oath, but because Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona recited, name by name, a list of Republicans and Southern Democrats who were expected to vote to convict Mr. Nixon in a Senate trial."
This was a moment that all three men looked back on with sorrow, not pride. But it seems fair to ask: Who in the Republican Party would be capable of doing what their country's interest calls them to do today?
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has yet to acknowledge Biden's victory. Nor has he pushed Trump to.
"What we all say about it is frankly irrelevant," McConnell has said. "All of it will happen right on time, and we will swear in the next administration on Jan. 20."
But launching a new presidency is not like throwing a light switch. Biden is being denied the national security briefings normally given a president-elect, and the General Services Administration, which is run by Trump appointee Emily Murphy, is withholding funding for the transition.
The initial impulse of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was to amplify the president's baseless claim. "President Trump won this election," he said on Fox News. "So everyone who's listening, do not be quiet. Do not be silent about this. We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes."
More recently, he suggested that it doesn't matter what is true, only what Trump can make Republicans believe is true. Asked to assess Biden's prospects for bringing the country together, McCarthy told Jonathan Martin of the New York Times: "It depends how it turns out. If you have 70 percent of Republicans who thought he cheated, he's still going to have a hard time."
When members of the House and Senate take office, they swear an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. At this moment, one of the greatest of those enemies can be found at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. It is time for Republican leaders to make that short drive.

D.C. Memo: Discounting all the votes

Texto completo: Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo, which is not coming to you from D.C. and is no longer being written by Gabe Schneider, who has — as faithful readers already know — taken a fancy new job with VoteBeat, a nonprofit dedicated to covering election integrity, an issue that seems like it’s having a bit of a moment.
We wish him well, and are not at all annoyed at being stuck writing this thing while we scour the country looking for MinnPost’s next great Washington correspondent. In the meantime, we’ll do our best to inform you on the latest news coming out of the nation’s capital — while also testing your tolerance for lame jokes, terrible puns and the occasional random interlude about stuff that has nothing to do with politics or D.C. You’re welcome.
Anyway, let’s get to it. This week in Washington, the president scrambles, Obama debuts, and the legend lives on from the Chippewa on down to the big lake they called Gitche Gumee. But let’s start with Donald J. Trump and his campaign’s latest efforts to overturn the results of an election that was held, according to my what-it-feels-like-amid-COVID-19 calendar, 17 years ago:
* In Michigan, Politico reports, the Trump campaign withdrew its last remaining federal lawsuit on Thursday, “falsely claiming that local election officials had declined to certify the Detroit-area’s vote tabulation even though they voted unanimously to do so Tuesday night.” Instead, the New York Times reports that Trump has summoned Michigan’s Republican Senate majority leader and speaker of the House to the White House, possibly as part of an effort to pressure the Legislature to appoint electors not in accordance with the vote in their state. (For what it’s worth, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Lee Chatfield said earlier this week, “That’s not going to happen.”)
* In Wisconsin, Trump has asked the state to recount votes in the state’s two largest Democratic counties, “paying the required $3 million cost and alleging that they were the sites of the ‘worst irregularities’ although no evidence of illegal activity has been presented,” reports the AP. “The recounts in Milwaukee and Dane counties will begin Friday and must be done by Dec. 1. Democrat Joe Biden received 577,455 votes in those two counties compared with 213,157 for Trump. Biden won statewide by 20,608 votes, based on canvassed results submitted by the counties.”
* In Pennsylvania, writes Politico’s Josh Gerstein, Trump’s campaign has filed yet another version of its lawsuit over the election results, this one “now contending that he should be named the victor in the presidential contest there or that the state legislature be given the authority to assign the state’s 20 electoral votes. The third iteration of the suit also restores legal claims dropped in the second version that the campaign’s constitutional rights were violated because of allegedly inadequate access for observers during the processing of mail-in ballots.”
* In Georgia, elections officials “expect to release a report Thursday on a hand tally of the presidential race, and they have repeatedly said they expect it to affirm Democrat Joe Biden’s narrow lead over Republican President Donald Trump,” notes the AP. “The hand tally of about 5 million votes stemmed from an audit required by a new state law and wasn’t in response to any suspected problems with the state’s results or an official recount request. The state has until Friday to certify results that have been certified and submitted by the counties.”
* In Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey says he’ll only accept the outcome of the presidential race after all related lawsuits are resolved. As the Arizona Republic reports, “Ducey would not comment on the merits of the two legal challenges still pending in Arizona — one involving Maricopa County’s audit process and another involving the Election Day experiences of just two voters — despite their unlikeliness to affect election results. A judge already dismissed another suit brought by the president’s team last week because it would have no effect on the outcome.” All this while the state’s secretary of state, Katie Hobbs , reported receiving “escalating threats of violence in the wake of the presidential election,” notes the Republic, who also says that Hobbs “called out other officials, including the president and members of Congress, for perpetuating misinformation about the results.”
* And last but certainly not least, we bring you the goings-on the Silver State of Nevada, where a Trump attorney is claiming the president, you know, won the state, “despite results showing the Democratic former vice president drew 33,596 more votes in the battleground state. ‘Donald Trump won … after you account for the fraud and irregularities that occurred,” campaign attorney Jesse Binnall told reporters as he announced a new lawsuit asking a state judge to declare Trump the winner or to invalidate the presidential vote results. With lawsuits flying in Nevada, Binnall castigated Clark County election officials; declared the campaign and state Republican Party can prove 40,000 tainted votes….”
If it doesn’t seem like all of this is particularly positive for the president or speaks to a highly disciplined legal strategy, that’s because it is not positive, and because there is, in fact, no strategy. For evidence of this, one need not look much further than the truly nutbar press conference called by Trump’s legal team on Thursday, a gathering so bizarre that Rudy Giuliani’ s melting face was only the second-most daffy aspect of the production. The guess here is that you would need an overhead projector, a Cray supercomputer, the ghost of Richard Hofstadter and several shots of tequila to truly untangle the whole mess, but the Washington Post’s Dan Zak and Josh Dawsey do as good a job as any in explaining the gist: “China is in on it. Cuba is in on it. Antifa and George Soros are in on it. At least two presidents of Venezuela, one dead and one living, are in on it. Big Tech is in on it; a Web server from Germany is involved (there’s always a server involved). Multiple major U.S. cities are in on it, as are decent American citizens who volunteer at polling precincts. Argentina is in on it, too, sort of. … The ‘it’ is a massive, premeditated scheme to steal the election from Donald Trump, according to Giuliani, and it also involved corralling poll watchers at great distances from the ballot counting.”
All of which gives credence to the notion that Trump has apparently all but given up on the idea of winning the election, at least via his team’s original strategy disqualifying ballots in key states. Instead, as a phalanx of Washington Post writers explain, the Trump campaign’s new goal is one “that appears equally unattainable: delaying a final count long enough to cast doubt on Biden’s decisive victory. … Behind the thin legal gambit is what several Trump advisers say is his real goal: sowing doubt in Biden’s victory with the president’s most ardent supporters and keeping alive his prospects for another presidential run in 2024. The shift in strategy comes after the president has suffered defeat after defeat in courtrooms around the country. And it serves as a tacit acknowledgment that Trump has failed to muster evidence to support his unfounded claims about widespread fraud.”
Part of those efforts involves putting pressure on low-level election officials around the country to sow doubts about the results, explains the New York Times’ Nick Corasaniti, Jim Rutenberg and Kathleen Gray: “The effort has been joined by surrogates like [Sen. Lindsey] Graham , who has used his visibility as a senior United States senator to make false claims about vote processing in Nevada; forward disputed accusations about mail ballots in Pennsylvania to the Justice Department; and level unsubstantiated accusations about supposedly fraudulent votes for Mr. Biden.”
But none of this seems to be actually doing the president much good. In fact, as Axios’ Glen Johnson points out: “President Trump’s frantic post-election challenges are having the opposite effect of what he intended: He’s documenting his demise through a series of court fights and recounts showing Joe Biden’s victory to be all the more obvious and unassailable.”
And if all that wasn’t enough to make Trump want to hammer-throw a 4-iron through the Mar-a-Lago lobby, this surely will: “ Former President Barack Obama ’s ‘A Promised Land’ sold nearly 890,000 copies in the U.S. and Canada in its first 24 hours, putting it on track to be the best selling presidential memoir in modern history,” writes the AP’s Hillel Italie. “The only book by a former White House resident to come close to the early pace of ‘A Promised Land’ is the memoir by Obama’s wife, Michelle Obama , whose ‘Becoming’ sold 725,000 copies in North America its first day and has topped 10 million worldwide since its release in 2018.”
Into the Lightfoot
Let’s pause here to take a (very brief) break from politics in order about what happens when the gales of November come early. Last week was the 45th anniversary of the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald, which is as good a reason as any to go deep on the man who made sure we don’t forget it. And we do mean deep. For something called Talkhouse, musician Robbie Fulks chronicles his once dismissive attitude — and recent reappraisal — of golden-tressed Canadian folkie balladeer Gordon Lightfoot , whose “Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” is, of course, the single most haunting song in the English language (don’t @ me; that’s just a fact). As Fulks explains his assignment: “Here’s what I ended up doing: listening to every Gordon Lightfoot song on every Gordon Lightfoot release (236 songs, 21 albums not counting the anthologies). I also studied lyric sheets, listened a second and third time, took notes, and discussed my thoughts among friends. This of course was completely out of proportion to the money that Talkhouse pays its writers. I considered it an experiment in self-improvement, to see whether I might revise a set of prejudices to arrive at a clearer understanding, perhaps even empathy.”

Delegation station

So back to your regularly scheduled programming. Up next, a quick look at what some of Minnesota’s congressional delegation has been up to of late.
On Tuesday, 6th Congressional District Rep. Tom Emmer was re-elected chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans’ campaign arm, following the GOP’s strong showing in the Nov. 3 election. As the Star Tribune’s Torey Van Oot writes: “The vote came just weeks after Republicans exceeded political handicappers’ expectations, winning hotly-contested seats to narrow Democrats’ majority in the U.S. House even as Joe Biden won the presidency. House Republicans had a net gain of seven seats and are leading in several races that have yet to be called.”
On Wednesday, after Gov. Tim Walz announced further restrictions aimed at combating COVID-19 in Minnesota, Emmer joined fellow GOP Reps. Pete Stauber and Jim Hagedorn in writing a letter to the governor express their concerns over his decision. “Over the last several months, Minnesotans have worked tirelessly to save their businesses, reemploy staff, and restart our economy. Now, Minnesotans are scrambling for their livelihoods once more, even as funds sit idle that should provide them relief and security,” the trio wrote. “As you force Minnesotans to close their businesses, we request that you immediately use the CARES Act money to provide Minnesota’s small businesses financial relief. Small business owners bear the cost of your new restrictions and it is imperative that these funds are used to assist them in their most dire hour.”
Meanwhile, another group of Minnesota lawmakers — U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, 2nd Congressional District Rep. Angie Craig , 4th CD Rep. Betty McCollum and 7th CD Collin Peterson — wrote their own letter, this one calling on the leaders of four federal agencies to streamline the rules around hemp, which is currently subject to contradictory federal guidelines. “The bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp in order to create economic opportunities for farmers,” says the letter. “Minnesota farmers appreciate the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) efforts in implementing the Interim Rule on Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program. However, despite the Interim Rule there are still hurdles in place for Minnesota farmers to fully realize the economic benefits of growing hemp.” The letter was sent to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Office of Management and Budget, the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Speaking of Peterson, the Star Tribune has a nice look back at his career in Congress.
And, finally, Sen. Amy Klobuchar called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to address flu vaccine shortages. “If you don’t get the flu vaccine and you get the flu, we know there are less hospital beds right now,” she told WCCO-TV. “You don’t want to start getting symptoms of flu and not know if you have coronavirus or the flu. It’s just a mess. And there’s not enough beds as it is right now, so we’re just asking everyone to get their flu vaccine.”
ICYMI
If you’ve read this far, it means you probably read MinnPost religiously — and why wouldn’t you — but just in case you got distracted by a pandemic or two, here’s a look at some of our can’t miss stories from the past week:
* “The 2020 results are likely to keep Minnesota legislative elections highly competitive — for a long time to come,” by Peter Callaghan
* “Minnesota’s COVID-19 measures: too far, or not nearly far enough?” by Greta Kaul
* “Minneapolis Council President Lisa Bender on George Floyd, ‘defund the police,’ and her decision not to run for re-election,” by Solomon Gustavo
* “What the results from a seesaw political rivalry in Bemidji says about the 2020 election,” by Walker Orenstein
That’s all for this week. Thanks for sticking around. Until next week, feel free to send tips, suggestions, and sound advice to: aputz@minnpost.com. And don’t forget to become a MinnPost member.

Ivanka Trump fires back at New York Times report on her finances: 'Harassment' motivated by 'politics' and 'rage'

Texto completo: Ivanka Trump, adviser and daughter to President Trump, responded to a report that authorities are investigating her finances by calling it “harassment” motivated by “politics” and “rage.”
“This is harassment pure and simple,” the president’s oldest daughter tweeted Thursday. “This ‘inquiry’ by NYC democrats is 100% motivated by politics, publicity and rage. They know very well that there’s nothing here and that there was no tax benefit whatsoever. These politicians are simply ruthless.”
She then linked to a New York Times article from 2018 with the headline “N.Y.’s New Attorney General Is Targeting Trump. Will Judges See a ‘Political Vendetta?’”
Tweet
The president’s finances have been under investigation since 2019 by both a civil investigation led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and an investigation led by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.
Those investigations now include consulting fees that were used as deductions to lower the president’s taxable income, and some of those fees were allegedly sent to Ivanka Trump, according to the New York Times.
The president’s taxes have been a focus of his political enemies since his entrance into presidential politics, and he has vehemently denied wrongdoing on multiple occasions, tweeting in September, “The Fake News Media, just like Election time 2016, is bringing up my Taxes & all sorts of other nonsense with illegally obtained information & only bad intent.”

Vox co-founder Ezra Klein and others leaving news website

Texto completo: Two co-founders of Vox are leaving the website that promises to "explain the news."
Editor-at-large Ezra Klein, who founded Vox with Melissa Bell and Matt Yglesias in 2014, is headed for the New York Times. Klein announced on Twitter that he will have a "column on policy and the policymaking process, and hosting an interview podcast."
"We have had a very long run of a founding team at Vox — almost seven years," Bell, who is currently Vox Media's publisher, told Axios. "While it's great to have high retention rates, I do feel excited about this new transition period. It allows us to take a hard look at what Vox will be in the years ahead."
Earlier this week, Yglesias announced that he would be leaving his position as an editor and columnist to pursue his own newsletter.
Lauren Williams, editor-in-chief and senior vice president of Vox, is also departing and joining a nonprofit startup in the news industry. "I couldn’t be more excited for Lauren's ambitious next step. She's identified an urgently necessary publication, and we look forward to partnering with her new outlet," Bell said of Williams.
A search is now underway at Vox for a new senior vice president and editor-in-chief, among other positions.
Other news outlets have parted ways with long-standing talent in recent months.
Glenn Greenwald, a columnist at the Intercept, which he founded seven years ago, quit last month, claiming that the publication was attempting to "censor" articles critical of President-elect Joe Biden.
Bari Weiss, a columnist formerly of the New York Times, left the publication over the summer. She criticized the newspaper for what she described as its obsequious embrace of social media. Columnist and blogger Andrew Sullivan departed New York magazine, echoing similar sentiments.

Journalists still want you to know they're the real heroes of the Trump era

Autor: Adams, T.

Texto completo: The press’ post-Election Day self-worship continues apace.

CNN’s Abby Phillip is the subject of a glossy interview this week in Harper's Bazaar, which describes the cable news staffer as a “star” on account of her specific brand of commentary.
Oh, good. Just what we need right now. More coverage of reporters and how they feel about covering the news.
“Amid the flurry of coverage surrounding the 2020 presidential election, one voice cut through the rest,” the ego- and profile-boosting interview begins, “it belonged to 31-year-old CNN political correspondent Abby Phillip, who … patiently announced and analyzed election results as they trickled in over the course of five taxing days.”

It adds, “A Harvard graduate formerly of ABC and The Washington Post, Phillip was widely praised for her astute commentary, cool composure, and, yes, unfaltering glow, emerging from the election a star in her own right.”

For those who may not remember, Phillip’s big moment in the 2020 Democratic primary came when she ambushed independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont with an unverified anecdote alleging he had told Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts that a woman cannot win the White House.

“Why did you say that?” Phillip asked Sanders.

The senator responded flatly, “I didn’t say it.”

“Sen. Sanders,” Phillip pressed, “I do want to be clear here: You’re saying that you never told Sen. Warren that a woman could not win the election.”

“That is correct,” said Sanders.

Amazingly, Phillip then turned to Warren and asked, “What did you think when Sen. Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?”

A star in her own right indeed.

If you can believe it, the Harper’s Bazaar interview is not the only post-election Phillip puff piece (someone’s agent has been working hard). The New York Times on Nov. 13 published a glowing expose of its own titled “Abby Phillip Is Next-Gen CNN.” Its subhead adds, “In an election dominated by fast-talking policy dudes, her deliberate commentary and context stood out.” The article never mentions who the “fast-talking policy dudes” are. It just asserts they exist and leaves it at that.
These advertisements for Phillip’s career are not the only examples of media making the 2020 election about media. On the contrary, there has been an abundance of news coverage and commentary about journalists and the overall job they have done over the past four years covering the Trump White House. Unsurprisingly, high marks are rewarded all around.

Esquire published an article on Monday originally titled “‘An Endless Hell-Loop of Being On Air': The Oral History of CNN's Election Week.”

The entire article details how CNN's on-air talent had to do what literally everyone else in the news business had to do for election week, with the key difference being that CNN's on-air talent have more amenities and support staff.

Enjoy how anchor Wolf Blitzer explains how he felt getting through the day after the election: “I was hoping somebody would go to Starbucks. We do have an excellent coffee machine that makes Starbucks black coffee, and you put some milk in it with one Splenda, and it may not be a Venti Skim Latte, but it's very good.”

News you can use.

On Monday, Slate published an interview with a photojournalist who wishes now to impart on everyone the wisdom he has gleaned these past four years from taking pictures at Trump rallies.

Earlier, on Nov. 8, the New York Times published a post-election profile of one of its own reporters titled “Trump Presidency Is Ending. So Is Maggie Haberman’s Wild Ride.” The article’s subhead adds, “For the last four years, the Times reporter has been the human incarnation of a nation riveted, like it or not, by Donald Trump.”

This is good. We need to know what the reporters think of the news.

Lastly, on Nov. 8, the Washington Post published an opinion article titled “The media never fully learned how to cover Trump. But they still might have saved democracy.”

“Without the reality-based press,” writes Washington Post columnist and former New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan, “whatever its flaws and shortcomings, we would be utterly lost.”

Except for acting, is there a profession in the world with a bigger ego, a more overinflated sense of importance, than the news business? Who but the feted, gilded millionaires of Hollywood place themselves atop such high pedestals?

Emergency room doctors don’t talk about themselves like this, and they are in the business of saving lives.

Jamelle Bouie: If Biden wants to be FDR, he needs the left

Texto completo: Not long before Election Day, Joe Biden traveled to Warm Springs, Georgia, to deliver a speech on the healing of America: “This place, Warm Springs, is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healed. That as a people and a country, we can overcome a devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. That yes, we can restore our soul and save our country.”
The location was intentional. Warm Springs is where Franklin Delano Roosevelt went to rest and recover, beginning in 1924, after his polio diagnosis and subsequent paralysis in 1921. As president he made it, along with his home in Hyde Park, New York, a kind of winter White House. He died there in 1945, just a few months after taking the oath of office for a fourth time. The town remains a shrine to the 32nd president, an ideal stop for someone who hopes to channel Roosevelt’s ambition (and also saw electoral opportunity in the state).
We now know that Biden will be president, but he won’t have the votes for FDR-size legislation. This doesn’t mean he’s dead in the water, but it does mean that Biden will have to marshal every resource and rely on every possible ally to win whatever victories he can. And he should know, as Roosevelt did, that this means grappling with the left — all of the left, including its most radical edges.
The Social Security Act of 1935, which established the nation’s old age and unemployment insurance programs, as well as its first stab at maternal assistance, represents traditional Democratic Party liberalism at its best: simple, broad-based and pragmatic. The basis for the American welfare state — and derided by opponents at the time as an example of “creeping socialism” — it remains a potent example of the power of government to help ordinary people. What the public knows is that it was the product of Roosevelt and the New Deal. Missing from this story is how much the law owes to the activism and agitation of the American left.
On Feb. 10, 1931, four years before Sen. Robert Wagner of New York and Rep. David Lewis of Maryland introduced President Roosevelt’s social security legislation to Congress, tens of thousands of Americans nationwide took to the streets at the height of the Great Depression to march for unemployment assistance and food aid. Organized by a then-burgeoning Communist Party, demonstrations ranged from peaceful protests to tense confrontations with law enforcement. In Boston, noted The New York Times in a contemporaneous report, “Two hundred Communists and sympathizers and about as many police staged a series of fights and scuffles along the Boston Common.” In St. Paul, Minnesota, “Communist-led demonstrators jammed their way into the House chamber of the Minnesota Legislature and held possession for more than two hours while they demanded relief for the unemployed.”
In New York City, similarly, “nearly 4,000 men, women and children heard half a dozen speakers call upon the government to grant unemployment insurance, stop evictions and to furnish free food, heat and light to the unemployed.”
These demonstrations weren’t just for the idea of unemployment insurance. The Communists had a particular bill in mind: the Workers’ Unemployment Insurance Bill, which the party had drafted the previous year. The Workers’ Bill, as it was called, promised generous assistance for the unemployed, for the sick and the old, and for new mothers, all financed by taxes on corporate income and inheritances.
With ongoing activism and agitation came greater support; rank-and-file pressure from within the American Federation of Labor, for example, led to the creation of the AFL Trade Union Committee for Unemployment Insurance and Relief, headed by Louis Weinstock of the New York Painters’ Union, himself a Communist. The committee endorsed the bill, which was later introduced to Congress by the Minnesota Farmer-Labor congressman Ernest Lundeen on the urging of Herbert Benjamin of CPUSA, who led the party’s effort to organize the unemployed.
Lundeen’s version of the “Worker’s Bill” quickly became a rallying point for unions and associations of the unemployed across the country. Here is the historian James J. Lorence in “Organizing the Unemployed: Community and Union Activists in the Industrial Heartland”: “Although the Lundeen Bill drew only lukewarm congressional backing, its strong rank-and-file support helped shape the debate that ended in the creation of the American unemployment insurance system.”
Over the course of 1934, grassroots organizers arranged marches, letter-writing campaigns and conferences in support of the bill. “The popular pressure crested in January 1935 with a major national demonstration to support the Lundeen Bill,” Lorence writes. “Among the groups endorsing the legislation were MESA (Mechanics Educational Society of America); AWU (Auto Workers Union); Railway Carmen; Machinists; Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers; the rebel AFL unions; and a large number of ethnic and fraternal organizations.”
Concurrent with the demonstration was a Communist-organized National Congress for Unemployment and Social Insurance. There, thousands of delegates from dozens of states agitated for its passage. Proponents of the Lundeen bill, like Thomas Arnold Hill of the National Urban League, urged its passage: “There must come before the Congress of the United States, legislation that will guarantee, for all workers regardless of age, occupation, color, sex, or political belief, full compensation for all loss of time occasioned by involuntary unemployment, industrial accident, and sickness. Minimum standards must be set below which this compensation must not fall. Costs must be placed not upon workers, but upon Government and capital; and workers must not be excluded from administering the benefits of such a plan.”
Aware of the Roosevelt proposal, which had been percolating within the administration for most of the previous year, proponents held out the Workers’ Bill as the only viable solution to the unemployment crisis.
“It is the position of the Communist Party that it is the responsibility of the national government to provide, against all those vicissitudes of life which are beyond individual or group control, a guarantee of a minimum standard of decent livelihood equal to the average of the individual or group when normally employed,” declared Earl Browder, the leader of CPUSA, in a statement made at Senate Finance Committee hearings on the Wagner-Lewis Bill. “The Communist Party opposes the administration bill because it violates each and every one of these conditions for real social insurance.”
On March 9, 1935, the House Committee on Labor, following hours of testimony from a cross-section of Americans, voted to send the Lundeen bill to the House floor, where it was promptly defeated by an overwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans. In death, however, the Lundeen bill, as well as the activism that brought it to Congress, helped clear the way for Wagner-Lewis, a proposal which even in its modesty redefined the relationship between state and citizen.
Paul H. Douglas, a University of Chicago economist and future senator from Illinois, made this clear in his 1936 book on the Social Security Act (as quoted in the essay “A Decade of Dissent: The New Deal and Popular Movements,” by Gertrude Schaffner Goldberg): “The radical and sweeping nature of its proposals enabled the administration forces to say to the indifferent and to the conservative that unless the latter accepted the moderate program put forward by the administration they might later be forced to accept the radical and far-reaching provisions of the Lundeen bill.”
From roughly 1930 to 1935, an amalgamation of leftists and laborers — employed or otherwise — made social insurance an urgent priority for the federal government. It is possible that something like the Social Security Act would have passed without this agitation, but knowing how difficult it is to move the U.S. government in any direction without the pressure of organized public opinion, I doubt it.
Let’s return to the present. The conditions of January 2021 will be very different from those of January 1935. The situation isn’t as dire and the left isn’t as strong. Neither is the Democratic Party. What, then, can Democrats take from this story?
Simply put, an ambitious, active left is one that widens the scope of reform. It’s a left that, even if you disagree with it, helps clear the pathways for action. It brings energy and urgency to liberal politics. And if nothing else, it’s a foil against which moderates can triangulate and make the case for more than marginal change, should they want it. Roosevelt was often frustrated with the left, but recognized its power and the importance of its vitality to his own cause.
There was no building the American welfare state without the left, and if it’s to be rebuilt, the left will have to be part of it. Democrats, especially would-be heirs to FDR, should take care to remember that fact.

DETROIT — The idea that the Nov. 3 election in this city was so flawed and corrupt that it could simply be overruled by state officials was “outrageous,” according to President-elect Joe Biden. “Very dangerous for our democracy,” said Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.
To Dale Rich, a 72-year-old genealogist and photographer in Detroit, it was even worse than that: unsurprising.
“It’s just an extension of what’s been going on for many, many years to Blacks and Black communities,” he said. “They wouldn’t have pulled this stunt with a white community, but they’ve gotten away with so much with us for so long.”
The decentralized nature of American elections means that any efforts to overturn a national vote, as President Donald Trump is trying to do, would come down to a handful of states, then to a few counties and cities within those states. For now, one of the states in the president’s sights is Michigan, which is apparently why he summoned a delegation of Republican lawmakers from the state to the White House on Friday.
Within Michigan, the place in the bull’s-eye is Wayne County, home of Detroit.
“It changes the result of the election in Michigan,” said Rudy Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, speaking at a news conference on Thursday, “if you take out Wayne County.”
This is true. And to many residents of Detroit, which is around 80% Black, the largest share of any major U.S. city, it is a familiar sort of math.
“This is not broken history, this is consistent,” said Lawrence Hightower, 69, a retired accountant who has been active in Detroit municipal politics for years. He acknowledged that some figures in Detroit, like the scandal-plagued former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, had not done the city’s reputation any favors. But he talked of a long line of attempts by white state leaders to take control of various city assets by citing mismanagement and abuse. He saw the latest election fraud allegations as all but predictable.
“In this super-polarized environment in an all-Black city, when you know doggone well that Republicans have been intimidated by Trump’s 70 million votes, not surprising in the least,” Hightower said.
Trump has been clear about what he thinks of voting in Detroit, a suspicion shared at least to some degree by two members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, who earlier this week initially declined to certify Detroit’s votes before changing their minds — and then trying to change their position again.
“It was obviously, you know, a pretext to try to cancel the Detroit votes,” Mike Duggan, the Detroit mayor, said in an interview, explaining that the precinct irregularities cited by the board members were, in fact, far fewer in number this year than in 2016, when Trump won Michigan.
“He is on this racial appeal that says to people, ‘You know, it’s the Black vote, that there’s something wrong with it,’ and yet, if you look at the analysis, he lost far more ground in suburban Detroit, suburban Atlanta, suburban Milwaukee and suburban Philadelphia,” Duggan said. “But he doesn’t want to talk about the fact that the huge shift in suburban women is the biggest factor in him losing those states. He goes to the same kind of us-versus-them appeal that has, you know, fueled his last four years.”
Jacque Hazard, 40, a barber who on Friday was casting a fishing line into the calm waters of the Detroit River, thinks Trump — “the most dangerous president we’ve had” — risks igniting racial unrest with his efforts to change the election.
“He can’t even lose right,” Hazard said, talking of how scary it was that crowds of Trump supporters were shouting “Stop the Vote” recently in downtown Detroit. “It’s a mess.”
It is unclear exactly what motivated the Michigan lawmakers to go to Washington to meet with the president on Friday. When asked by a reporter whether Trump should concede the election, Mike Shirkey, the state Senate majority leader and one of the legislators invited to the meeting, responded by singing a hymn.
On Friday evening, after the meeting, Shirkey and Lee Chatfield, the Speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, who had also met with the president, said in a statement that they had “not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan, and as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan’s electors.”
They said they used their time with the president to ask for additional federal funds to fight the coronavirus.
Still, given the president’s focus on election fraud, some Detroit residents assumed the worst about the meeting.
“Why would they do this, when people have voted?” said Darla Marineau, who was standing behind the register of her boutique. “It’s absurd and ridiculous.” Trump, she said, was “trying to destroy everything in his wake on the way out.”
Though the nation is focused on what could happen to the presidential election results, there are more local but no less urgent realities for state politicians: constituents to reassure, future primaries to navigate, fractious parties to hold together. In an era of unpredictable partisan realignment, most Republicans still can agree on measures like voter ID requirements and on where they believe those measures are most warranted.
“Every part of the party believes that we should clean up the voting process,” said Douglas Koopman, a political-science professor at Calvin University in Grand Rapids. “Particularly in Detroit.”
Back home in Shirkey’s district, about an hour west of Detroit, his constituents were not entirely sure about the purpose of his White House meeting. In Jackson, Michigan, some shared the skepticism or disgust voiced in Detroit about the claims of a tainted election and Trump’s attempt to overturn the result.
“Why put yourself in a position to get strong-armed by the president?” Roger Auwers, a school district finance manager, said of Shirkey. As for Trump, he said: “He’s trying to do as much damage as he can as he’s heading out the door.”
But more common seemed to be support for digging deeper into Trump’s allegations.
Andrew Alexander, 32, a gas construction worker who was eating a burger outside with a co-worker, said if Shirkey and the president were sharing doubts about the election results, that was perfectly justified. “There is a right to due process, and that should be sought out.”
David Hardie, 27, an insurance broker who was helping his mother file paperwork on a new house, agreed and then some. “It’s just a fact that with all mail-in voting, there will be a level of fraud,” he said. “They should let people get to the bottom of this.”
That’s what the president had been saying, Hardie said. And as for his own state senator: “I’d be more than thrilled if Shirkey supports him.”
Back in Detroit, Rich was resigned, seeing the attempts to cast doubt on his city’s votes as a reflection of the president’s audacity and the increasingly nasty environment of the country.
“Whether anyone likes it, the Black vote is powerful,” he said. “Otherwise, why would they go out of their way to try to suppress it? Such efforts used to be more subtle. Now? Anything goes.
“In the larger picture,” he continued, “I think it will get worse.”

The illicit drug operation between a Nebraska pharmacist and a dark web dealer from Maryland was going so well that the pair was running out of drugs to sell, according to federal prosecutors.
They said the pharmacist, Hyrum T. Wilson, 41, of Auburn, Nebraska, sent more than 19,000 doses of prescription drugs from Hyrum’s Family Value Pharmacy in Auburn to William Anderson Burgamy IV, 33, of Hanover, Maryland, from August 2019 to April 2020.
But when Wilson hit limits set by a distributor, capping the amount of drugs he could obtain and send to Burgamy, the two came up with a plan.
The gains would have been twofold, prosecutors said: Wilson and Burgamy planned to raid a rival pharmacy, scooping up a supply of drugs to sell. Then, after burning down the pharmacy, business would be booming at Hyrum’s, increasing the amount of drugs Wilson could send to Burgamy to sell on his site on the dark web, NeverPressedRx.
On Friday, in a U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, Burgamy was sentenced to 14 years in prison and Wilson to nine years. Burgamy had earlier pleaded guilty to four felony counts of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, money laundering and firearms conspiracy and conspiracy to use explosives. Wilson had pleaded guilty to three felony counts, similar to Burgamy’s, though without the firearms count.
The plot, which the pair had dubbed “Operation Firewood,” involved skull masks, duffel bags, Molotov cocktails and a rental car, with the supplies list jotted into a black leather-bound notebook. Wilson crafted a “getaway” map with escape routes for Burgamy to use after the attack, the Justice Department said.
But the plot was never carried out. It began to unfold in December, when the FBI, along with agents from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration, began investigating NeverPressedRx, Burgamy’s site, as part of an international investigation into trafficking on the dark web, according to the Justice Department.
Starting in January, investigators placed and received nine undercover purchases of oxycodone and Adderall from NeverPressedRx. During the investigation, law enforcement identified Burgamy as the site’s operator; surveillance was conducted on Burgamy “on several occasions as he placed packages” from NeverPressedRx into the mail, court documents said.
The site, which proclaimed that “all of our stock comes directly from a US Pharmacy,” had a stellar reputation: 99.95% of its reviews were positive, investigators found in April.
On April 9, federal law enforcement arrested Burgamy at his home before raiding it. They found eight firearms, all loaded, including two AR-15 assault rifles, as well as “thousands of prescription opioid pills,” according to court documents.
Federal law enforcement agents executed search warrants at Wilson’s home and at his pharmacy on the same day. He was arrested a week later.
The Justice Department said that Burgamy gave a cut of the profits from the drug sales to Wilson through Bitcoin payments, wire transfers and bundles of cash sent through the mail. Burgamy claimed that he made nearly $1 million through the operation.
While the pair was waiting for coronavirus restrictions to be lifted before they carried out the plan to bomb the rival pharmacy, the virus offered another opportunity, the department said: Wilson and Burgamy discussed selling hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to profit from the pandemic.
Wilson’s lawyer, Joseph Howard, said in a phone interview Friday evening that his client was coaxed into the drug dealing and the firebomb plot by Burgamy after the two had met online playing the “War Dragons” video game.
Wilson is on the autism spectrum, Howard said, and “just can’t function socially.” He was happy to have found a friend in Burgamy, Howard said. When he realized he was “trapped,” Wilson tried selling the pharmacy in an effort to escape the operation, Howard said.
Burgamy’s lawyer, Elizabeth Ann Mullin, a public defender, declined to comment Friday night.
Hyrum’s Family Value Pharmacy was one of three pharmacies in Nebraska chosen in December for a state health department pilot program to distribute free naloxone nasal spray kits to prevent opioid overdoses.

NEW YORK — It was 2 p.m. Tuesday, on what would have normally been a busy weekday as the Thanksgiving holiday neared. Alex Weisman, a stage and television actor, stepped off a train at a subway station on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and was punched twice in the face by a man who fled.
The assault broke Weisman’s skull in two places and tore one of his retinas.
“There was nothing else I could have done to protect myself,” Weisman, 33, said Friday. “I am shaken by this.”
The day after Weisman was attacked, a man was shoved onto the tracks at the Bryant Park subway station after arguing with a man believed to be a panhandler. On Thursday, a 40-year-old woman was shoved off the platform at the Union Square station by an emotionally disturbed man who appeared to be homeless. She lay between the tracks and avoided serious injuries as a train passed over her.
The trio of violent attacks on the subway is part of a worrying trend: After overall crime on the system dropped significantly during the citywide lockdown this spring, violent crimes, like assaults, started to surge.
There were arrests in the two shoving episodes. None of the attacks were related, police said.
Now, as the financially battered public transit agency warns of major service cuts and fare hikes if federal aid does not arrive, the increase in crime has stoked fears among riders and complicated the transit agency’s effort to coax people back to the system.
Police and transit officials have cautioned that the system remains overwhelmingly safe and that the crime spike does not come close to resembling the dark days of the 1970s and 1980s, when trains were splashed with graffiti and rampant violence was a source of constant dread for riders.
Still, videos of violent attacks like those this week have circulated on social media and shocked riders, many of whom already harbor public health concerns about using public transportation during a pandemic.
“I think people are a lot more short-fused now,” said Sharleen Saunders, 38, as she stood on the platform at the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays station. “And I think they’re acting out when they are upset.”
A video of the attack at Union Square station Thursday, which was shared widely on Twitter, showed many riders’ worst fear playing out in real time. Moments before a northbound No. 5 train arrived at the station, a man lunged at a woman standing across from him, sending her flying onto the tracks. Seconds later, the incoming train sped over her as another rider held his head and dropped to the floor in disbelief.
The woman, 40, landed in a small space between the tracks that prevented her from being hit by the train’s wheels and avoiding serious injuries, police said.
“It was by the grace of God that she sustained only minor injuries,” Kathleen O’Reilly, the transit police chief, told reporters Thursday. “We see him waiting and calculating when the train comes into the station, and at the opportune moment, he pushed her to the tracks.”
The rise in serious crimes is a stark turnabout from the spring, when the citywide shutdown drained the subway of 90% of its riders and overall crime in the system plunged.
Police officials attributed that drop-off to fewer riders presenting targets for pickpockets and other relatively minor crimes.
But the emptiness in stations may have emboldened people who were looking to commit more serious crimes and who felt more confident doing so with fewer possible witnesses, police officials have said.
“Less riders can certainly give way to certain crimes,” the former transit police chief, Edward Delatorre, said in an interview last month. “A barren station or a shutdown could be inviting for certain crimes.”
The only subway crime that has decreased in 2020 is grand larceny, a trend that may reflect lower ridership. In 2019, police recorded nearly 1,400 incidents of grand larceny, while as of Sunday only 716 had been recorded.
But other serious crimes have increased in 2020 despite a subway ridership that remains at about 30% of pre-pandemic levels. As of Sunday, there had been 514 robberies recorded compared with 455 in the same period last year. Through the end of October, there had been 294 reports of felony assault compared with 289 in the same period last year.
So far this year, there have also been six homicides, compared with three in the same period last year, and five reports of rape, up from three last year.

NEW YORK — It was 2 p.m. Tuesday, what would normally have been a busy weekday as Thanksgiving neared. Alex Weisman, a stage and television actor, stepped off a train at a subway station on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and was punched twice in the face by a man who then fled.
The assault injured Weisman’s skull in two places and tore one of his retinas.
“There was nothing else I could have done to protect myself,” Weisman, 33, said Friday. “I am shaken by this.”
The day after Weisman was attacked, a man was shoved onto the tracks at the Bryant Park station after arguing with another man who police believe was a panhandler. On Thursday, a woman was pushed off the platform at the Union Square station by an emotionally disturbed man who appeared to be homeless. She lay between the tracks and avoided serious injuries as a train passed over her.
The three attacks were part of a worrying trend: After overall crime on the subway dropped significantly during the citywide lockdown this spring, violent crimes have started to increase. So far this year, incidents of felony assault, rape, homicide and robbery on the subway have surpassed the number of those crimes committed in the same period last year.
Now, as the financially battered transit agency that runs the system warns of major service cuts and fare hikes if it does not get substantial federal aid, the rise in crime has stirred fears among riders and complicated officials’ efforts to coax people back to the subway.
In recent months, the agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo controls, has criticized the New York Police Department for not deploying more uniformed officers to the system.
But the recent rash of attacks has also led transit officials to press the city to provide more support for mentally ill people who seek shelter on the subway.
“This city has a mental health crisis right now,” Sarah Feinberg, New York City Transit’s interim president, said at a news conference Thursday. “We have got folks in this city who desperately need mental health care. I’m desperate for this mayor or the next mayor to take it on because we’ve got a long way to go.”
Police and transit officials say the subway remains overwhelmingly safe and that the latest spike in crime pales next to the dark days of the 1970s and ’80s, when trains were splashed with graffiti and rampant violence was a steady source of dread among riders.
There were arrests in both of the shoving incidents this week, and both suspects appeared to be homeless and mentally ill, police said. Neither those attacks nor the one involving Weisman were related, police said.
Videos of some attacks have circulated on social media and alarmed riders, many of whom are already anxious about using public transportation during a pandemic because of health concerns.
“I think at this time it’s bad to be standing over there,” said Senance Johnson, 37, nodding toward the platform’s edge at an L line stop in Brooklyn on Friday, “because a lot of people are getting pushed.”
A video of the Union Square attack shows many riders’ worst fear playing out in real time. Moments before a train arrives at the station, a man lunges at a woman standing near him, sending her flying onto the tracks. Seconds later, the incoming train speeds over her as another rider holds his head and drops to the floor in disbelief.
The woman, 40, landed in a small space between the tracks that kept her from being hit by the train’s wheels, police said. The man who attacked her, Aditya Vemulapati, 24, surrendered to a transit worker and was taken into custody, officials said. He was charged with attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment, police said.
“It was by the grace of God that she sustained only minor injuries,” Kathleen O’Reilly, the transit police chief, told reporters Thursday. “We see him waiting and calculating when the train comes into the station, and at the opportune moment, he pushed her to the tracks.”
Police arrested a second man, Justin Pena, in the shoving incident at the Bryant Park station and charged him with attempted murder and reckless endangerment, officials said.
Hector Gonzalez, a maintenance technician from Manhattan who has lived in the city since 1983, said he worried that New Yorkers with mental illness had been forced to seek refuge on the subway.
“I don’t think it has to do with violence, random violence,” Gonzalez said Friday as he waited for a train at the Jay Street-MetroTech station in Brooklyn. “I think it has to do with people who are not being taken care of.”
City officials say they have provided more housing for those in need during the pandemic, which resulted in the subway being shut down overnight for deep cleaning; 1,200 beds were added for homeless people and others who typically seek shelter in the system, and hundreds of outreach workers were deployed to offer services.
So far, nearly 600 people who were effectively living on the subway have been provided with shelter, said Steven Banks, the city’s social services commissioner.
“Anybody who looks at the situation would say there are the lowest number of people experiencing homeless in the subway system than in any point in decades,” he said.
The rise in serious crimes is a stark turnabout from the spring, when a citywide shutdown that was put in place to stem the spread of the coronavirus drained the subway of 90% of its riders and overall crime in the system plunged.
Police officials attributed the drop-off to fewer riders presenting targets for thieves and other relatively minor crimes. But the emptiness in stations may have emboldened people who were intent on committing more serious crimes and who felt more confident doing so with fewer possible witnesses, police officials have said.
“Less riders can certainly give way to certain crimes,” Edward Delatorre, a former transit police chief, said in an interview last month. “A barren station or a shutdown could be inviting for certain crimes.”
The only subway crime that has decreased is grand larceny, a trend that may reflect the reduced ridership. In 2019, police recorded nearly 1,400 incidents of grand larceny, while only 716 had been recorded in 2020 as of Sunday.
But other serious crimes have increased this year despite subway ridership remaining at about 30% of pre-pandemic levels.
As of Sunday, there had been 514 robberies recorded, compared with 455 in the same period last year. Through the end of October, there had been 294 reports of felony assault, compared with 289 in the same period last year.
So far this year, there have also been six homicides, compared with three in the same period last year, and five reports of rape, up from three last year.
In response to safety concerns, the transportation authority hired 85 uniformed and unarmed security guards to patrol the subway and call police in response to violent incidents as necessary. In addition, up to 60 authority police officers and 300 city police officers are on duty in the subway per shift, according to the authority.
Still, in recent months, many transit workers and riders worried that they were seeing fewer offices in the subway.
O’Reilly said the system was the subject of renewed focus in recent weeks.
Before the presidential election, “a lot of our transit resources were used topside to help with demonstrations and protests,” she said at an authority board meeting Wednesday. “I can let you all know, as of today, 99% of those resources are now back in transit.”

Republicans in Congress Stay Largely in Line Behind Trump

Nearly two weeks after President-elect Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election, leading congressional Republicans remain unwilling to recognize his victory, keeping silent Friday even in the face of President Donald Trump’s increasingly brazen attempts to subvert the results.
As Trump met at the White House with Michigan lawmakers in hopes of overturning that state’s popular vote, a few additional fissures emerged in the otherwise solid wall of Republican support for his tactics. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the retiring chair of the Senate’s health committee, became the most senior Republican to call for Trump to begin the transition process. And the party’s top House appropriator, Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, said it was time for the president and Republicans to “move on.”
“If there is any chance whatsoever that Joe Biden will be the next president, and it looks like he has a very good chance, the Trump administration should provide the Biden team with all transition materials, resources and meetings necessary to ensure a smooth transition so that both sides are ready on day one,” said Alexander, a three-term senator, former governor and former education secretary. “That especially should be true, for example, on vaccine distribution.”
But by and large, those notes of dissent and others came from Republicans who are already retiring at year’s end or have no immediate plans to face voters, like Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska.
As Trump mounts perhaps the most audacious challenge to the democratic process in recent memory, the critical mass of the Republican Party has raised nary a concern about his behavior, appearing to have bowed to fears of angering him and the conservative base on which he holds a firm grip. While publicly silent, they privately worry that speaking out could invite a primary challenge, squander party enthusiasm before a pair of crucial Georgia Senate runoffs and undermine their message as they embark on a wholesale effort to undercut Biden’s presidency from the start.
And having defied the predictions of a down-ballot bloodbath at the hands of voters fed up with Trump, congressional Republicans have seen there is little political cost for their quiet support.
“The House Republican Conference is really the party of Trump,” said Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, a newly elected member of party leadership, even as he implicitly acknowledged Biden’s victory. “I’m skeptical that Joe Biden will be anything but a lame duck from day one.”
For his part, Biden has largely tried to position himself above the political fray and his 306-vote Electoral College victory as beyond dispute. He plunged forward Friday, meeting in Wilmington, Delaware, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrats in Congress, for the first time since his victory to discuss an approach to a year-end government spending package and how to provide additional coronavirus relief.
The statements by Alexander stood out not just because other congressional leaders have held their tongues but because Alexander is extremely close to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. and the majority leader, and often consults with him on delicate issues.
Aides for McConnell and Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican, did not respond to requests for comment Friday.
McConnell, seeking to avoid a messy dispute with a president more popular with their party’s base than he is, has repeatedly sought to divert questions about Trump’s refusal to concede by pointing to the procedural details of the country’s election system. It is a way of avoiding an overt challenge to the president and buying time until state election authorities essentially render his claims moot by officially certifying the results.
“We’re going to have an orderly transfer from this administration to the next one,” McConnell said this week. “What we all say about it is, frankly, irrelevant.”
Many of his colleagues have adopted the same approach, playing down the significance of Trump’s language by focusing on the courts.
“It’s working its way through the court system, and I don’t have any independent way to assess it,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Pressed by a reporter in the Capitol on whether he thought Trump could prevail, Hawley, a former state attorney general, said, “Anything’s possible.”
Julian E. Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University who has studied the modern Republican Party, argued that history would not look at the finale of Trump’s presidency — which he called a “radical act” — as narrowly as McConnell might like.
“It will not just be about messy and contested elections,” he said. “It will be about presidential power, and the nature of the Republican Party in modern times, and what happens when there is no one to say ‘Stop’ anymore.”
Some who have challenged Trump from within his party have also scolded their colleagues in recent days, urging them to set political expediency aside for the good of the country.
“While the president has the right to legitimate legal challenges, responsible citizens cannot let the reckless actions by him and his legal team stand,” Bob Corker, a former Republican senator from Tennessee who retired in 2018, wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Republicans have an obligation when the subject is of such importance to challenge demagoguery and patently false statements.”
Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida, a Republican who is retiring this year, lamented in an interview how many of his colleagues were “just hiding out” rather than speaking out against Trump.
“What about self-esteem or respect?” Rooney said. “What are these people going to do in the long run when they look back at how they just sort of slavishly devoted themselves to this guy?”
A handful of Republicans appeared to heed those calls by Friday, or at least to lose patience with some of the more outlandish claims by Trump’s team.
Sasse said it was telling that the legal team had declined to “actually allege grand fraud” in court, where, unlike in the news media, there is a consequence for lying. Romney said late Thursday that it was “difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American president” than Trump’s apparent attempt to pressure officials from Michigan and elsewhere.
And Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who was among the first Republicans to recognize Biden’s victory, said in a statement Friday that there was “a right way and a wrong way for the incumbent president to pursue his rights to contest what he perceives as election irregularities.”
“The wrong way is to attempt to pressure state election officials,” she said. “That undermines the public’s faith in our election results without evidence and court rulings to support the allegations.”
The criticism also came from other Republicans not known for challenging Trump. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, a member of McConnell’s leadership team, on Thursday called some of the election fraud claims “absolutely outrageous,” though she did not fault the president.
Granger, who was reelected to represent a conservative district based in Fort Worth, Texas, was more direct: She told CNN that she had “great concerns” about what Trump was doing.
“I think that it’s time to move on,” she said.
But the most scathing criticism came from lawmakers who had no voter backlash to fear. Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan, who is retiring, wrote in an op-ed in The Detroit News that Trump’s “continued refusal to acknowledge the election results risks corroding our democracy by literally hollowing it out.”
“If we no longer believe in our own system — with our local elected clerks following the laws — then our ability to choose our leaders is at fundamental risk, as is our system of governing,” he wrote in the piece, which was co-signed by Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.
Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., suggested that many in his party were torn between the facts and the views of their constituents who believe Trump’s assertions that he was defrauded of victory.
“There are millions of Americans that are represented by those folks that are very frustrated,” said Reed, who has congratulated Biden. “Maybe there’s a response to them that they feel an obligation to represent as they go forward.”

Kiera Allen makes her feature debut this week, playing opposite Sarah Paulson in the Hulu suspense film “Run.” It is a rare instance of a wheelchair user starring in a thriller.
In a recent Zoom interview, Allen, 22, discussed playing Chloe, a home-schooled teenager with an overprotective single mother, and how the movie upends typical narratives about people with disabilities. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: We don’t often see an actor who uses a wheelchair in real life in this type of role — in a major thriller.
A: It feels like it’s going to be the first time a lot of people in my generation ever see a real wheelchair user onscreen playing a wheelchair user. That’s a huge honor.
There is so little media representation of people with disabilities that I feel like I’m representing an entire community because of this lack of visibility. I’m really hoping that this movie brings down some barriers and that more disabled people are cast in major movies.
Q: What did you think of the movie’s portrayal of disability?
A: This film is unusual in the way it portrays disability, not only in the authenticity of casting, but in the story: This is not a girl who’s made to be a victim or who’s only there to inform another character’s journey. She defines her own journey. Her disability is a part of that, but it doesn’t define who she is. It’s similar to the way I view myself.
Q: What was it like to be on set? Was it different from past experiences?
A: Everyone listened. They wanted to know how best to accommodate me and how to make everything comfortable and accessible. There were things that they thought of that I hadn’t even thought of. So we had great communication throughout. They approached me about sending a memo to the crew, just being like, Here are a few things about working with a person with a disability to make everything go smoothly: For instance, don’t push my chair; don’t come behind me and push my chair without asking first. Just putting out one small page of information made a huge difference.
Q: How did your real-life experience or the nuances of your life get translated into or help shape the role?
A: The script was already written so beautifully in this way — as soon as I read it, I emailed the director [Aneesh Chaganty] and was like: This is one of the best representations of a disabled character I’ve ever seen. And regardless of if I’m right for the role or not, I cannot wait for people to see this.
And so even though it was already so compelling to me, when we got onto set, they made space for me to say things like, “This is how it would be most comfortable for me to do this” or “I would use this word and not this word,” like very small things, because the script was already so good, but things that did make a difference to me.
Q: Have you discussed the film with anyone who is disabled?
A: I’ve had some really great conversations about accessibility, about Chloe, and how she flips the narrative of abuse of disabled people. She’s not a victim. She’s a hero. And the mother, the abuser, is not portrayed as someone who’s doing her best in trying to care for a disabled child and it’s just too much for her and she has no other choice. The film doesn’t sympathize with her in that way. That’s something that I’ve talked about with some disabled folks who’ve seen the film and find that perspective refreshing.
Q: There is one scene where a broken escalator foils an escape. Did you have any input in that?
A: That was all the writers. They wrote this wonderful representation of disability. They did a lot of homework. One of the things I love so much about this film, and that’s so unique, is its representation of accessibility. It is in so many ways a scary story of accessibility and inaccessibility. Chloe gets trapped in a basement and can’t get out because her mother has weaponized inaccessibility against her.
It’s a terrifying thing, inaccessibility, being trapped somewhere, being unable to get out, having to rely on people who may or may not have your best interests at heart, people who you may not even know, when a space is inaccessible. That stuff is really scary. And I’ve never, ever seen any art in any form that represents that terror. And it is terrifying.
People often see it is as unfortunate or sad or something to be pitied. But it’s not that; it’s much more visceral. It’s a threat and it’s a terror.
Q: What has it been like to see disabled characters portrayed by nondisabled actors?
A: There have been films that represent disability using able-bodied actors that have been important to me, and I felt seen and I felt like this was a representation of disability that was really true to my life. But that was also all I had. I didn’t have a lot of pieces of entertainment — films, TV, plays — where I could see a genuinely disabled person in that role. I’m just so excited for young people to see that now.
Q: What would you like to do next? Where do you see your career going?
A: I’m in college, so I’m just thinking about the present moment of getting through the semester and this film release. I absolutely want to continue acting. I love to write as well. I would love to make that a part of my acting career. It’s exciting to be a part of this big moment for representation, but I do hope it’s a lasting change.
There is a bit of a history of disabled actors being celebrated for one role and then not having opportunities on that same level again. That scares me. But as long as I’m doing work that’s good, with good people, and that’s rewarding, that’s something I’m really happy to do.

WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden on Friday announced new staff appointments and met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, maintaining his focus on the economy and the coronavirus pandemic while ignoring President Donald Trump’s continued efforts to subvert the election results.
The Democratic leaders gathered in Wilmington, Delaware, for their first in-person meeting since the election to “discuss their shared priorities to provide immediate help to struggling working families and small businesses,” they said in a joint statement.
In a brief photo opportunity with reporters, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris were seated with Pelosi and Schumer at a large rectangular table, all wearing masks and distanced several feet from one another.
“In my Oval Office, me casa, you casa,” Biden joked, drawing chuckles from the others. “I hope we’re going to spend a lot of time together.”
Friday was Biden’s 78th birthday, and Pelosi gave the president-elect a white orchid in celebration, according to an aide.
None of the Democrats said anything more of substance to reporters, but in a joint statement afterward they said they “agreed that Congress needed to pass a bipartisan emergency aid package in the lame duck session,” including money to fight the coronavirus and to support struggling families, businesses and state and local governments.
Biden had discussed his agenda for the first 100 days of his presidency, including to “contain” the coronavirus and restore the economy, in what the statement called “the American people’s mandate for action.”
The statement made no reference to Trump’s false claims about the election, a day after Biden called them “totally irresponsible.” Jen Psaki and Yohannes Abraham, speaking for the Biden-Harris transition, were measured on the subject during a briefing for reporters, saying that they were “moving full speed ahead” but avoiding provocative language that would escalate tensions.
The message of discipline appeared in keeping with the Biden campaign’s winning strategy of declining to engage with Trump’s theatrics and presenting the president-elect as a steady figure focused on the pandemic.
But underscoring the strange limbo Trump has created, Biden on Friday posted on Twitter a plea for private donations to fund his transition activities. “Here’s the deal: Because President Trump refuses to concede and is delaying the transition, we have to fund it ourselves and need your help,” he wrote. Clicking the link leads to a form hosted by ActBlue, a Democratic network, which suggests donations of $15 to $5,000, though users can give any amount.
Psaki and Abraham reiterated calls for the head of the General Services Administration, Emily W. Murphy, to approve paperwork that would begin an official presidential transition and provide Biden and his staff members with access to federal resources, data and personnel.
“This isn’t a game,” Abraham said, noting that a growing number of business groups and leaders, such as the heads of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, had recently called for the transition process to begin.
Asked whether the Biden team has had contact with Trump administration officials, as some reports have indicated, Psaki said, “We certainly would love to have that engagement.”
But, she added, the transition team “has been very careful, of course, about following those rules and guidelines, and we’ll have to abide by that until ascertainment happens.”
Ascertainment is the term for when the General Services Administration concludes that the election has produced a winner and a transition can begin.
Biden has spoken repeatedly in recent days about the urgent need for Congress to agree on a new stimulus spending package, saying that Senate Republicans should drop their opposition to a measure that House Democrats passed last month. He has made no public suggestion that Democrats should change their position and offer new compromise legislation.
Psaki said that Biden had also spoken with “elected officials from both sides of the aisle.” When asked whether that included congressional Republicans, whom Biden has said he hopes will break ranks to challenge Trump’s election claims and compromise on stimulus spending, she did not offer more specifics.
Biden also announced four more appointments to his White House staff.
Catherine M. Russell will be the director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. During the Obama administration, Russell served as the chief of staff to Jill Biden, then the second lady, and was U.S. ambassador for global women’s issues at the State Department. She is married to former President Barack Obama’s former national security adviser, Tom Donilon, who is the brother of Biden’s chief political strategist, Mike Donilon, and who may also land a big administration job.
Taking over the White House Office of Legislative Affairs will be Louisa Terrell, a former special assistant for legislative affairs to Obama and a former Capitol Hill aide whose jobs included chief of staff to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.
The policy director for Jill Biden will be Mala Adiga, a lawyer who served in a similar role in the Biden-Harris campaign and handled women’s and human rights issues at the State Department and National Security Council under Obama.
The White House’s social secretary will be Carlos Elizondo, who was the social secretary to the Bidens during the Obama administration and the first Hispanic American to hold that job. The position involves planning and managing official White House events, including state dinners.
Transition officials offered no specifics about when the team might announce further personnel appointments, including Biden’s first Cabinet nominees.

A Cal Football Player Opted Out Because of the Virus. Then Came the Tuition Bill.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Henry Bazakas embodied everything the University of California wants in a football player.
A third-generation Cal student who grew up in Berkeley, Bazakas arrived on campus five years ago as a walk-on offensive lineman. Three times he earned an award for having the team’s highest grade-point average. He and a teammate spearheaded a summer reading program at local elementary schools. He won another award, for his commitment to strength and conditioning while recovering from a torn knee ligament. And last season, after he finally earned an athletic scholarship, he started three games at left tackle.
But none of that counted for much in June, when Bazakas called the Cal football coach, Justin Wilcox, to say that he was opting out of his final season because of health concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic.
The call was the beginning of an odyssey that illustrates the normally unseen, cutthroat side of the business of college football, with tensions that have been magnified for athletes by the determined push to play during the pandemic.
Nine days later, Bazakas found his scholarship had been cut off, and he was then billed more than $24,000 halfway through his summer term because the athletic department had revoked the financial aid that it had already paid.
The summer school aid was ultimately reinstated by a university appeals committee, which said the school had violated NCAA rules by abruptly pulling Bazakas’ aid before giving him an opportunity for a hearing.
Bazakas also asked for his scholarship back for the fall semester, but the appeals panel sided with the athletic department’s decision to not renew it. While most of his teammates arrived at Cal with scholarships pledged for four years, walk-ons like Bazakas, who eventually earn scholarships, may not get them in subsequent years, and Cal had met an NCAA deadline in July not to renew his.
“It feels like the second I was done playing football, the program was done with me,” said Bazakas, who waited nearly three months for his summer aid to be restored through appeal.
Wilcox, the football coach, and Jay Larson, the senior associate athletic director who administers the football program and directed its arguments against Bazakas’ appeal, declined interview requests about the case. Herb Benenson, an athletic department spokesperson, said Bazakas knew that he had not been offered a scholarship for the 2020-21 academic year when he left the team.
This is true, but only partly so. Bazakas had asked his coach several times over six months whether the scholarship would be renewed. He got no firm answer. Wilcox’s decision came through an email from the financial aid office on June 25.
Benenson said the athletic department, even though it argued against Bazakas, agreed with the university’s decision to restore the player’s summer aid. Benenson said the aid was mistakenly canceled because of a clerical error that did not come to light until an inquiry by The New York Times in mid-October, a month after the committee’s ruling.
Bazakas said neither Wilcox nor Larson, nor anyone else from Cal, had contacted him to acknowledge what Benenson characterized as “an honest mistake.”
‘All the power is in the coach’s hands; you can’t negotiate,’ a former teammate said.
As major college football has lurched through the pandemic in pursuit of billions in television revenue — Cal had its first two scheduled games canceled, then lost Sunday to UCLA in a game arranged two days before kickoff — not even mandated protections for players have been ironclad.
In August, Washington State receiver Kassidy Woods, who opted out because he has the sickle cell trait, was allowed to keep his scholarship but removed from the team when coach Nick Rolovich told Woods it would be “an issue” that he was aligned with a player rights’ movement. Utah State coach Gary Andersen, before he was fired after an 0-3 start, said there was a reason none of his players had opted out. “It’s not an option,” he told reporters. “If you opt out, you’re not with us.”
As players weigh their health risks, an unstated pressure urges them to continue competing to maintain their places in the pecking order for playing time. For those who arrived as walk-ons, a missed season heightens the uncertainty about whether a scholarship will be renewed.
“The way we use our voice, how we play or practice — that’s what determines if we keep our scholarship,” said Gabe Siemieniec, a former walk-on kicker at Cal who transferred to Louisiana Tech before the season, in part because he was not sure whether his scholarship would be renewed. “It’s kind of interesting. All the power is in the coach’s hands; you can’t negotiate.”
Programs at the top level of college football may offer up to 85 football scholarships each year, with the remainder of a 120-player roster filled by nonscholarship players, or walk-ons.
Walk-ons can be indispensable to even the best programs. In practices, they mimic opposing players to help the starters prepare for the next game. They often lift the team grade-point average and sometimes compensate for recruiting mistakes when they blossom into contributors. The patron saint of walk-ons is Hunter Renfrow, who caught a last-second touchdown to win the national championship for Clemson in 2017.
For walk-ons, a scholarship is not just a financial reward.
It is a stamp of legitimacy earned through sweat and sacrifice in the weight room, on the practice field, and through their play on Saturdays. Scholarships are often conferred in front of teammates in elaborate presentations, which the schools happily promote on social media.
‘You’re supposed to make every decision for the team.’
Bazakas recalled the immense pride he felt when Wilcox informed him that he would be on scholarship last year. Bazakas grew up sitting in the stands at Memorial Stadium rooting for Cal. His late grandfather, a Cal graduate, was a season-ticket holder. His father, a financial officer at a tech company, and his mother, an educator, graduated from Cal. His affinity runs so deep that he rejected his mother’s suggestion that he apply to Cal’s archrival, Stanford.
Although Bazakas — who started playing football in high school — drew interest from Ivy League schools and Weber State, he jumped at an offer from Sonny Dykes, then the coach at Cal, to join the Golden Bears as a walk-on.
“That was a dream come true,” Bazakas said.
Bazakas quickly realized how far he was from playing in a game. But he got stronger and improved his technique. By his third season, he had worked his way up to the 70-player travel squad. The next season was cut short by a torn knee ligament.
Last year, after being awarded a scholarship, Bazakas was thrust into the conference opener because of a teammate’s injury and helped the team drive the length of the field for a late field goal to beat Washington. He started three games and also played in a victory over Stanford that ended Cal’s eight-game losing streak in the rivalry.
“It was my proudest moment,” Bazakas said.
Bazakas had hoped for more highlights this season. He wanted to compete for a starting position. But he is grateful for the experiences he has had.
“I didn’t want it to end the way it did, but in the scale of 2020, most things aren’t going the way people wanted them to go,” Bazakas said.
Bazakas opted out at a moment of great uncertainty for college football players. Some schools were requiring athletes to sign liability waivers upon returning to campus for summer workouts, and it was weeks before conferences like the Big Ten, the Pac-12 and the Southeastern conferences said they would honor scholarships for athletes who opted out. The NCAA did not make it a blanket policy until August. (The standard scholarship agreement says that athletes can have their aid canceled if they withdraw from a team.)
“You’re supposed to make every decision for the team, and that’s what you want, but at some point, you’re an individual,” Bazakas said. “You’re not really allowed to advocate for yourself. You don’t realize you can until you’re out of the system.”
Around the time Bazakas opted out, two close friends on the team — offensive linemen Valentino Daltoso and Jake Curhan — were at the center of a movement by Pac-12 players that pushed for more rights for players, including say on health protocols and protections for athletes who chose to sit out a season.
Andrew Cooper, who ran cross-country at Washington State and Cal and has been an organizer in the athletes’ rights movement, said Bazakas’ case was one of many that were discussed as hundreds of players around the country had group conversations over the summer through videoconferencing. (Daltoso and Curhan did not respond to interview requests.)
“Ninety-nine percent of college athletes stay silent about the injustices they experience,” Cooper said. “We’re told, ‘Just be grateful.’” He added, “When it comes down to it, no one is there to protect us, because athletic departments’ financial interests do not align with athletes’ interests.”
The pandemic upended the best chance for walk-ons to earn their scholarships anew.
Bazakas was among six walk-ons who received scholarships last season and were eligible to return in 2020. Wilcox made it clear that the aid was for one year and that subsequent years could be awarded if Cal had scholarships available.
Two of those players were certain to have their scholarships renewed because of their strong play. Shortly after last season ended, the four others were called into Wilcox’s office, one by one, and left with a similar impression: that their aid was very much uncertain for the next season. Some of their spots, for example, could be taken by transfers who would fill more urgent needs.
The former walk-ons viewed spring practices as their best chance to prove to the coaches they deserved to have their scholarships renewed. But after four sessions, football was shut down because of the virus.
“Everything was up in the air,” Siemieniec said.
The three other players besides Bazakas entered the transfer portal to seek scholarship offers elsewhere. Two transferred, and one, tight end Collin Moore, had his scholarship renewed.
Bazakas, though, was already deep into a master’s program for information and data science, so leaving did not make sense.
But by June, as teams planned for summer workouts, Bazakas began to question whether returning to campus was a good idea.
Bazakas, who stands 6-foot-6, weighed 330 pounds at the time, putting him in a high-risk category if he contracted the virus. His parents are in their 50s, so they could be vulnerable, too. He worried about catching the virus while working out with his teammates, then bringing it home or to people in his neighborhood.
“The thought of going back scared me a lot,” said Bazakas, who had repeated conversations with his teammates, his girlfriend and his family over several months.
Finally, on June 16, the day before Cal announced players could return to campus to prepare for voluntary workouts, Bazakas called Wilcox.
“He was pretty understanding,” Bazakas said. “He said the world is crazy and everyone has to make a choice. He asked, ‘Is there a chance I can talk you out of this, or have you made up your mind?’ I told him I had made up my mind. He said, ‘OK, I respect that.’ It wasn’t a long conversation.”
Bazakas said his scholarship was not discussed.
‘Man, I’m going to have to explain this to my parents.’
When he called his coach, Bazakas did not know about the key date of July 1, when the NCAA requires schools to notify athletes of any roster reduction for the next academic year. The date was not mentioned in the financial aid agreement that Bazakas signed for 2019-20. Benenson, the athletic department spokesperson, acknowledged that Bazakas had not been notified of Cal’s deadline, but he said Wilcox had told the player not to expect a renewal.
As for summer aid, each school makes its own decisions. This summer Cal tightened its financial belt. The athletic department, which was facing a $55 million deficit if there were no fall sports, largely restricted athletes to one summer class because of virus-related budget constraints, Benenson said.
Bazakas appeared to be an exception. He received a text May 18 from Joel Derechinsky, the team’s academic coordinator, who asked if Bazakas needed to take all three classes he had registered for during the summer semester.
Bazakas, who earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration, replied that he wanted to leave his final two classes for the fall semester during the season. Derechinsky said that would be OK. (Derechinsky declined to be interviewed.)
A month later, Bazakas received notice that he would no longer be on scholarship. One night, as he considered whether to appeal, Bazakas checked his student account portal before he went to bed.
He blinked.
It carried two new charges on July 1: $23,506 for summer fees and $631 for the summer stipend. “I was pretty shook,” Bazakas said. “I thought, ‘Man, I’m going to have to explain this to my parents.’”
As September approached, Bazakas filed the final paperwork in his appeal with the help of several family friends, including a lawyer.
The athletic department countered Bazakas’ plea for restoring his summer aid by offering part of it back. Larson, in a Sept. 3 letter to the appeals committee, wrote, “Although we are not required to do so by NCAA rules, we have decided to provide summer aid to cover tuition and fees for one of Mr. Bazakas’ courses.”
The three-person committee sided with Bazakas. It said the athletic department failed to provide a hearing before his aid was revoked, which is required by NCAA rules.
But Bob Jacobsen, an undergraduate dean who was on the committee, said Bazakas’ summer aid was restored because Cal’s policy does not allow aid to be revoked during a term. When asked why that was not written in the ruling, he said, “This is not a Supreme Court decision where we have to cite it. If the document doesn’t make sense as a public relations document, so be it.” He added, “We didn’t expect anybody would be reading it.”
Benenson said the athletic department learned more recently that its error occurred because Bazakas’ courses were incorrectly classified as beginning in late July rather than in May.
The case for a fall scholarship, Bazakas knew, was more difficult to make. He is spending $15,000 to take his last two classes, and he will graduate in December.
“I understand the business of football — if you don’t need a lineman as bad as you need a receiver and you take it away,” Bazakas said of the scholarship. “But I never got an answer. I never heard a yes or no. When I talked to Coach Wilcox the last time, I said if I hadn’t stepped away, would I have still gotten my aid? He didn’t answer.”
He added, “That’s the biggest what-if. If I hadn’t opted out, what would have happened?”
Bazakas — who signed off on his appeal letters with “Go Bears!” — said his experience had not soured him on Cal. He has followed the myriad twists his old teammates have endured; in August the Pac-12 postponed football, only to later decide to play after all, albeit with a truncated schedule. Practices have been interrupted and schedules upended. He feels for his teammates.
Last weekend Bazakas — 50 pounds lighter, having shed some of his football girth — sat in front of the TV and did what he had always done. He rooted for the Bears to win.

A tight House rematch in central New York between a first-term Democrat and an outspoken Republican supporter of President Donald Trump has gone to the courts, with only 100 or so votes separating the two after a prolonged absentee ballot count.
The contest between Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a moderate Democrat, and Claudia Tenney, a former Republican congresswoman seeking to recapture her seat, has crystallized the extraordinary nature of this year’s pandemic-era election cycle.
Tenney had amassed a formidable 28,422-vote lead based on in-person ballots received during early voting and on Election Day. But, because of the pandemic, nearly 60,000 mail-in ballots were cast. The last of them were counted Thursday, more than two weeks after the polls closed.
The results have not been released or finalized, but both campaigns agreed Friday that Tenney’s lead over Brindisi has shrunk to around 100 votes. It was unclear whether there was a small number of affidavit ballots elsewhere in the district yet to be counted.
The race is likely to be decided by a judge, as both camps gear up for a protracted legal fight over an unknown number of contested ballots that could determine the victor. Neither candidate has conceded, and The Associated Press has not called the race.
A victory for Tenney, whose staunch support of Trump made her a polarizing figure in the Republican-leaning district, would underscore the president’s lasting popularity in more rural parts of the nation. For House Democrats, losing the seat could mark the latest setback in an already disappointing year.
“Now that every vote has been counted, we have maintained the vote lead and are poised to come out victorious,” Tenney said in a statement on Thursday night. “This process has been long, but it is critical that every legal vote be counted and accounted for.”
The race in the 22nd District, one of the most competitive and expensive in the nation, is one of the few remaining congressional races in New York and the country without a clear winner.
The contest is a rematch from 2018, when Brindisi narrowly unseated Tenney, defeating her by just 4,473 votes in a Republican-leaning district that Trump carried by 15 percentage points in 2016.
That election also came down to about 15,000 absentee and affidavit ballots that allowed Brindisi to grow his narrow Election Day lead and declare victory about a week after voters had gone to the polls. Tenney formally conceded more than a week later, losing by about 1 percentage point.
This time around, the outcome will depend on a greater number of absentee ballots among the more than 300,000 votes in the district, which stretches from the southeastern shores of Lake Ontario to the northern Pennsylvania border.
Brindisi has been able to cut Tenney’s lead by winning about three-fourths of all mail-in ballots. Most of the absentee ballots that remained to be counted, about 5,000 of them, were in Chenango County, which began and finished its count on Thursday.
“As today’s numbers show, Congressman Brindisi continues to gain meaningful ground,” Luke Jackson, a spokesman for the Brindisi campaign, said in a statement on Thursday. “With a margin this close, New York voters deserve to have their voices heard. The stakes are too high and the margin too close to rush to judgment.”
Earlier this month, the beginning of the counting process was slightly delayed after the Tenney campaign filed a lawsuit asking for absentee ballots to be impounded or secured, a common tactic in very tight races.
Justice Scott DelConte of the New York state Supreme Court allowed the ballots to be impounded, and established rules for how to handle ballots the campaigns objected to. It is unclear exactly how many ballots those were, but the judge is expected to ultimately rule on their validity.
“Our team is simply asking the court to preserve our right to object to ballots that were not legally or properly cast,” Sean Kennedy, a spokesman for Tenney, said at the time. “We are fighting to ensure that all ballots are accounted for, and only legal votes are counted.”
He added, “We are highly confident that we will prevail after all the votes are counted.”
After meeting with the parties on Friday, DelConte said all eight counties should report the final vote totals to him on Monday in order to address ballots contested for technical errors.
There are more registered Republicans than registered Democrats in the district, as well as a sizable chunk of independent voters. But Brindisi was able to upset Tenney in 2018 by highlighting his moderate credentials to appeal to moderates and Republicans upset with Tenney, a Tea Party favorite whose divisive rhetoric has paralleled Trump’s.
Following the 2018 shooting in Parkland, Florida, for example, she said that “so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats.” Those remarks, and others throughout the years, have drawn rebuke from liberals as well as members of her own party.

Texto completo: The claim: Joe Biden underperformed Hillary Clinton in every major metro area except four in swing states run by Democrats, where the vote exceeded the number of registered voters
As states work to certify their vote counts, some are still searching for ways that President-elect Joe Biden’s win might not be legitimate. Claims that vote counts could not be accurate due to the sheer number of votes Biden received are circulating online.
Rasmussen Reports, a conservative-leaning pollster, shared an article by right-wing media group Gateway Pundit on Twitter, which was screenshotted and shared to Instagram and Facebook. Rasmussen’s tweet pulls a quote from the article.
“Biden underperformed Hillary Clinton in every major metro area around the country, save for Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta and Philadelphia ... in these big cities in swing states run by Democrats ... the vote even exceeded the number of registered voters,” the tweet reads.
The Gateway Pundit story is based on an article in conservative publication Townhall.
Erika Haas, a spokesperson for Townhall Media, told USA TODAY its story “jumped the gun” and has since been corrected.
Neither social media user who shared the screenshot nor Gateway Pundit responded to USA TODAY’s request for comment.
Biden received more votes than Clinton in most major metro areas
Biden received significantly more votes than Clinton in most major metro areas.
USA TODAY aggregated official 2016 voting data and unofficial 2020 voting data from the country’s 10 largest cities — or the counties in which they’re located, if data by city was not available — plus Detroit, Milwaukee and Fulton County, where Atlanta is located. Biden received more votes than Clinton in 10 of those 13 locations. All data was aggregated Nov. 18.
According to unofficial counts, Biden outperformed Clinton in:
Chicago by 19,613 votes,
Philadelphia by 20,150 votes
Milwaukee by 6,004 votes.
He also outperformed the 2016 presidential candidate in the counties that include:
Houston (+210,279 votes)
San Antonio (+128,902 votes)
San Diego (+226,849 votes)
Dallas (+137,496 votes)
San Jose (+103,574 votes)
Phoenix (+337,867 votes)
and Atlanta (+84,093 votes) are located, according to their unofficial counts.
The three cities where Biden appears to have underperformed Clinton are New York, Los Angeles and Detroit, one of the cities in which the post lists Biden as allegedly overperforming.
It’s worth noting, though, that two of those states are still counting ballots. The New York Times reported that New York state could have roughly 2 million ballots left to count. In Los Angeles County, roughly 66,245 ballots remained to be counted as of Nov. 17, the last time the county updated the Secretary of State. It’s too early to determine whether Clinton truly outperformed Biden in those locations.
A similar finding
National Review, a conservative magazine, reached the same conclusion. It analyzed the 36 largest cities where Biden beat Trump by at least 10,000 votes, as measured by countywide votes, excluding California and New York because the states are “counting votes so slowly” they could not yet be compared.
National Review cited data from uselectionatlas.org, which aggregates official election results, and determined that Biden improved his margin of victory compared to Clinton in 31 of 36 urban counties.
“If you are still looking for proof that Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election, nearly two weeks after Election Day, you will need to do better than this,” National Review wrote.
Who runs those states?
And, the swing states referenced in the post are not all run by Democrats.
Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania have Democrat governors, but Republican state legislatures, according to Ballotpedia.
Georgia has a Republican governor and state legislature.
No evidence votes exceeded number of registered voters in swing states
There’s no evidence that swing states had more than 100% voter turnout.
USA TODAY debunked that claim after determining that it originated from outdated data on the website World Population Review. Prior to Nov. 4, World Population Review’s data showed voter registration figures that had not been updated since at least Aug. 7.
More: Fact check: States don't have more than 100% voter turnout in an election
A search of key states’ reported registration data found that swing states’ voter turnout did not exceed registration. World Population Review updated its data Nov. 4, which approximately mirrors each state’s actual registration totals, USA TODAY reported. It is unclear from where the table’s creators pulled the projected vote totals, which are higher than several states’ Nov. 6 reports of ballots cast.
A Georgia county was thrust into the spotlight for similar accusations, but USA TODAY determined the discrepancy in votes were not due to extra votes but rather a number of ballots being printed twice, in English and Spanish, for language minority groups. The bilingual ballots are required under law.
Our rating: False
We rate the claim that Biden underperformed Hillary Clinton in the country's major metro areas as FALSE because it was not supported by our research. The claims that the four swing states listed are led by Democrats and that votes exceeded the number of voters registered in those states are also false.

Who Postpones Black Friday? This Year, the French

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
PARIS — The French government on Friday declared it was postponing Black Friday as it moved to quell a nationwide rebellion by shopkeepers who say that Amazon has been stealing business from them during France’s coronavirus lockdown.
Black Friday, the U.S. import that has been embraced by European retailers as the quasi-official kickoff to the Christmas shopping season, will be delayed by a week in France, to Dec. 4, after the government wrested an agreement from Amazon and the country’s biggest retailers to delay their discounts.
The move is intended to level the playing field for booksellers, clothing shops and “nonessential” businesses that were forced to close their doors Oct. 30 after a second national lockdown was imposed, propelling consumers to online sites, including Amazon.
Under the accord, big retailers agreed to put off their Black Friday sales promotions on the condition that the government reauthorizes the reopening of small retailers by then. Shopkeepers have agitated since the new lockdown orders took effect to be able to restart business.
“Let us open or we will die,” Yohann Petiot, director general of France’s Alliance du Commerce, a trade group for businesses, told government officials this week.
But the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, did not say Friday when shops and other nonessential businesses would be allowed to resume operations. While the current lockdown has helped curb an alarming new outbreak of coronavirus cases, French health authorities have cautioned that any reopenings must meet strict safety protocols.
Stores “will be able to open as soon as health indicators improve,” Prime Minister Jean Castex said Friday.
The spectacle of one of Europe’s most powerful countries scrambling to protect its retailers from Amazon highlights the difficulties governments are facing as they try to strike a balance between enforcing a second round of shutdowns amid pandemic fatigue and preventing businesses that don’t have the same deep pockets as big corporations from collapsing into mass bankruptcies.
In France, the episode has ignited a fresh backlash against the U.S. online giant. Since it arrived in 2000, Amazon has become a favorite in France, capturing nearly half of online spending in 2019. During the most recent lockdown, sales in France jumped nearly 50% from a year ago, the company said.
But rapid growth has turned Amazon into a symbol of a dominant multinational that detractors say is importing unwanted American-style consumerism as well as job instability and environmental degradation to the eurozone’s second-largest economy.
In the lead-up to the announcement, Le Maire and other politicians urged shoppers not to give Amazon their business.
The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, and environmental organizations and trade groups, circulated an online petition titled “Noël Sans Amazon” (“An Amazon-free Christmas”). Addressed to Santa Claus, it commits signatories to a “#ChristmasWithoutAmazon,” which is described as a tax-dodging Grinch that destroys small businesses, jobs and the environment in France.
The virtual call to arms, however, quickly fell victim to an online hack that overloaded the website with fake signatures sent from more than 200 different servers, including hundreds in the name of Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, with the comment, “Sorry, not sorry, Jeff.”
But Amazon’s influence in France — it holds around 20% of the French e-commerce market — is such that other big retailers held back from agreeing to postpone their Black Friday sales until Amazon did.
After Le Maire told the French Senate on Wednesday that it made sense to help small retailers by postponing Black Friday, Frédéric Duval, general manager of Amazon France, told a French radio station Thursday that Amazon was “listening to the recommendations of the government” and would put off its online sales until Dec. 4, paving the way for a broad accord.
Still, the scramble by French politicians to soothe the ire of small businesses has reopened a broader controversy over Black Friday itself, which wasn’t even an event in Europe until a few years ago. It was ushered in mainly by Amazon, which began promoting major sales in lockstep with those in the United States.
While the American Thanksgiving is just another Thursday in Europe, Black Friday has thrived. In Britain, Spain and other countries, Amazon and other big retailers already started offering Black Friday discounts online earlier this month.
France has been slower than other European countries to join the trend, and politicians have discouraged shoppers from participating, warning of “a frenzy of consumption” in which people are encouraged to buy products they don’t need. The fact that Amazon is not a French company did not help, either.
Yet Black Friday has been a crucial tool for retailers to top up sales. Last year, retailers in France raked in an estimated 6 billion euros in revenue around Black Friday.
Those sales are more critical than ever this year as retailers faced unprecedented losses from lockdowns linked to the coronavirus pandemic. Although stores reopened from June through September, it was not enough to fully compensate for France’s first lockdown; year-to-date sales are still, on average, 10% below their 2019 levels, according to an analysis by German bank Allianz.
Restrictions on nonessential stores in France have already cast a shadow over the nearly 18 billion euros in retail sales that retailers normally make in November and December, Allianz said.
Whether pushing back Black Friday will help small retailers remains to be seen. The pandemic has rocked the economy, and the government is spending billions of euros to keep small businesses afloat, offering cheap state-backed loans and government subsidies for payrolls.
In one sense, the Black Friday delay has given small retailers a leg up. Several big chains that were allowed to remain open, including supermarkets like Carrefour and electronics giants including Fnac and Darty, had already printed promotional materials that may now have to be discarded.
Some bigger retailers had started offering discounts this week. Others have contracts with suppliers for deliveries in time for Nov. 27 promotions that may now need to be delayed.
Small retailers have used the lockdown to speed up the creation of websites and infrastructure to enable online ordering. The government has tried to encourage a transition to online sales, pushing “click and collect” activity, where customers can order online and come collect their own package.
Many shops, though, still don’t have the resources to compete with organized bigger retailers that have pickup and delivery infrastructures in place. In some cases, the government has stepped in with even more subsidies: Recently, it announced it would pay postage for booksellers to send orders through the mail as a way of encouraging the French to buy locally rather than on Amazon.
The online giant, however, will likely continue to be a big winner in the pandemic. Global sales surged 35% in the first nine months of the year, to $260 billion.
It is expected to rake in billions more with global Black Friday sales, which are now being carried out Nov. 27 everywhere in the world where it operates — except France.

After a ‘COVID Semester,’ the University of Michigan Gets Tougher on the Virus

The University of Michigan’s flagship campus in Ann Arbor opened the fall semester with great expectations. Thousands of students were welcomed back to the dorms in August. Nearly 1 in 3 classes offered in-person instruction. Even Big Ten football eventually kicked off its season after some early doubts.
Pessimists were asked to reserve judgment. But hundreds of faculty members and graduate assistants protested the level of face-to-face interaction. Several prominent public health experts scorned the school’s lack of mandatory coronavirus testing. Parents worried that students would not be safe.
Sure enough, by midsemester, coronavirus clusters were erupting on and off campus: 11 positive tests in a week in the athletic department; 13 more tied to two restaurants near campus; 17 in one dormitory. In October, county health authorities ordered the campus to shelter in place, citing “social gatherings” on or near campus as a major source of infections.
Now, after more than 2,540 COVID-19 cases among students and staff, the university is shifting course drastically. It has asked students not to come back to campus in January unless they have to. Each dorm room will hold only one person, forcing thousands of students to stay home or find off-campus housing. Instruction will be remote in 90% of classes. Students who violate certain health rules will face tougher sanctions, including automatic probation, and coronavirus tests will be mandatory for anyone coming to campus.
“One thing I’ve learned in this COVID semester is that every decision you make that makes one subset of people happy will make a different subset of people unhappy,” said the school’s president, Mark Schlissel, a physician, who has been a focus of criticism all year and is being pummeled again with complaints about the school’s new policies.
“What’s changed is the national context,” he said. “The outbreak is blossoming again all over the country, including in our state.”
The University of Michigan’s about-face comes as the nation is recording more than 162,000 new virus cases a day and many states are imposing tougher health restrictions. In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, has suspended in-person classes in high schools and colleges, and shut down bars, indoor dining, bowling alleys and other businesses for three weeks despite intense opposition from many Republicans, including members of the Trump administration.
In many ways, the school’s chaotic fall has typified the struggles of big state universities that tried to maintain some semblance of normalcy amid contagion, allowing intercollegiate sports, Greek life and off-campus housing — often without the kind of mandatory coronavirus testing considered crucial to containing outbreaks.
And like Michigan, many of those universities are now looking to batten down their hatches for the winter and spring semesters. Virtually all classes at the university pivoted this week to remote instruction, and students will be sent home until the Jan. 19 start of the winter semester.
The State University of New York has delayed 2021 classes until Feb. 1 across its 64-campus system, requiring all students to be tested upon their return and throughout the semester. Dozens of campuses — the University of Arizona, the University of Wyoming, Cornell University, the University of Kentucky and many others — have canceled spring break, while the Ivy League has ended intercollegiate athletic competition at least through February.
There are some schools looking to open up their campuses. At the behest of its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, Florida’s public universities plan to offer even more face-to-face classes next year. But they seem to be outliers.
Although the virus has proved to be less lethal among young people, it has also spread like wildfire on many campuses. A New York Times survey has revealed at least 321,000 cases at 1,700 colleges across the country. Among the hardest hit: Clemson University in South Carolina with more than 5,080 cases; the University of Florida with more than 5,000; and the University of Georgia with more than 4,380.
The prospect of a vaccine, while encouraging, is not likely to make campuses safer in the short term, said Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington evolutionary biologist who has been tracking the pandemic.
“I don’t think there’s anybody now who thinks this will be gone by January,” Bergstrom said. “It’s clear that we have to hunker down.”
That assumption was less clear this summer, when Michigan decided to bring some 6,400 students back to campus housing. Students relished the prospect of college-town life in Ann Arbor. Regents welcomed the revenue from housing.
Health experts were cautiously optimistic, too, including Schlissel, who earned his M.D. and Ph.D. at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and is an immunologist.
He was especially hopeful that campus rules would influence the behavior of students who planned to rent apartments in Ann Arbor — typically two-thirds of the school’s 48,000 undergraduate and graduate students live off-campus — because they could not break a lease or because “they’d rather live with their friends than in mom’s basement.”
In an August message to campus, he wrote that off-campus students might even end up safer than if they had chosen to study remotely from home.
But Michigan did not mandate weekly or biweekly coronavirus tests as a condition of coming onto campus, as did some universities, including Duke University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Beyond an initial pre-entry test that students were instructed to take before the fall semester started, testing was limited to people who had been exposed to the virus, who had symptoms or who opted in to a weekly surveillance sample of about 3,000 volunteers.
At that time, the commercial labs working with the university could not process tens of thousands of tests fast enough to effectively contain outbreaks, Schlissel said; the university’s own hospital worried that it could not help without undermining care for patients.
Ann Arbor had a relatively low infection rate, he told university employees, and a lot of risk could be mitigated with masks and social distance. But faculty members were not reassured.
“Show us the science,” more than 830 faculty members and graduate instructors demanded in an Aug. 7 letter, citing an influential study on campus reopening that suggested the University of Michigan needed to do much more testing. In an online town hall, Schlissel tried to explain that testing had limits, even at places like the University of Illinois, which had invested heavily in testing and tracing. But his choice of words inflamed the situation.
“Sometimes testing can give you a false sense of security,” he told the faculty, repeating a Trump administration argument against testing. And universal testing at an institution of Michigan’s size was, he said, “science fiction.” Without evidence, he added that the HIV epidemic had spread as “people got a negative test and they presented it to their sex partners.”
Schlissel quickly walked back the HIV remark and apologized, saying he only meant to question the effectiveness of universal testing. But the video was on YouTube. Gregg Gonsalves, professor of epidemiology at Yale University and co-director of the Global Health Justice Partnership, called his stance “egregious” in The Nation, and other epidemiologists, including Bergstrom and one of the authors of the study on safe reopening, Yale’s A. David Paltiel, blasted him on Twitter.
By the time fall classes started Aug. 31, graduate students were preparing to strike rather than teach face-to-face, and undergraduates, parents and faculty were petitioning for expanded testing. Two and a half weeks later — on the same day the Big Ten announced it had found a way to test athletes daily and therefore would go ahead with football season — Schlissel’s faculty narrowly passed a vote of no confidence in him.
The faculty relationship has since improved, but the virus has whipsawed the campus. Schlissel said outbreaks have been traced almost entirely to undergraduate gatherings. In late October, after health authorities in surrounding Washtenaw County slapped the campus with an emergency stay-in-place order, the faculty petitioned the president for a winter semester with fewer students in dorms, fewer in-person classes and much more mandatory testing. It had more than 1,100 signatures.
Schlissel still talks about testing as just one key tool in a combination of actions necessary to control the virus, but he has come around, he said, to seeing its importance in “reassuring” the community. When classes resume in 2021, the university will de-densify the dorms and ramp up testing. Only about 3,000 students will be allowed back into university housing, and anyone who comes onto campus, symptomatic or not, will have to be cleared via a saliva-based test processed by a faculty-founded startup in Ann Arbor.
“If they don’t,” Schlissel said, “we’ll inactivate their ID cards.”
The retrenchment has pleased faculty but upset undergraduates and their parents. More than 1,500 angry parents have signed a petition protesting the short notice with which the university canceled spring housing contracts. If the university doesn’t “reverse its drastic decision to close the dorms,” it says, the parents want a discount.
“He should say, ‘Listen, we screwed up,’ and apologize to all of us,” said Amy Tara Koch, a Chicago writer and Michigan alumna whose daughter, a freshman, scrambled last week to find an apartment for the spring in Ann Arbor. “And then give a tuition abatement. Out-of-state tuition there is, like, $50,000.”
The disappointment has been particularly keen, other parents said, because Michigan’s reputation for academic excellence had led them to expect a state-of-the-art response to the crisis.
“It’s all too little, too late,” said Sherry Levine, a teacher from Rye Brook, New York, whose son, a junior, lives in a fraternity house in Ann Arbor and who feels the university’s pandemic response all year has been merely “reactive.”
Schlissel said the university had refunded housing deposits for the spring, offered lower double-room rates to students who’ll spend the spring in a single and already “apologized profusely.” And, he noted, not all of the fall semester lessons were negative.
“Students continued in their studies, they’ll get credit for the semester, they’re going to head toward being Michigan graduates and they’re doing so in an environment that is really challenging,” he said. “Everyone is doing their best.”

BRUSSELS — Simon Gronowski had committed many acts of bravery and generosity in his 89 years of life, and opening a window in April wouldn’t ordinarily have counted among them, but this was no ordinary April.
It was the height of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, which hit Belgium as hard as anyplace in the world. But as a Holocaust survivor, Gronowski had faced death more intimately before.
The diminutive lawyer summoned his courage, moved his electric piano to beneath a windowsill and flung the window open, letting in spring sunshine along with the thick, wary quiet of a city terrified of the virus. And he began to tap out a jazz tune.
“I was afraid,” he said. “It’s not normal to just open the window and play.”
But soon, his neighbors popped their heads out of their windows, some even donning masks and walking up to his house to hear better.
One took a black-and-white picture of him playing, printed it and slipped it in his mailbox later, writing, simply, “Merci.”
He began to play regularly, filling the leafy streets with jazz notes and bringing relief to his besieged neighbors throughout the lockdown that lasted into late May.
Amy Edwards Anderson, an English teacher from the United States who has lived in Brussels for 22 years, first heard Gronowski play while sitting in her backyard with her husband and three children. She was surprised, she said, because it quickly became clear this wasn’t someone practicing the piano. It was someone performing for the block.
The short window concerts burst into her family’s confinement and lifted them up.
“Here was someone who was amplifying music to share with neighbors for no other reason than to make people feel good during a difficult time,” she said. “A kind of unsolicited gift to the neighborhood.”
Gronowski had meant for his impromptu concerts to make people happy, but playing for others has also had intrinsic value for him his entire life.
“Music is a means of communication, of connection,” he said on a recent afternoon in his home office, surrounded by piles of documents.
Gronowski taught himself how to play the piano as a teenager because he, too, was seeking to communicate, to connect — first and foremost with his older sister, Ita, who had perished in Auschwitz in 1943 at age 19.
“I adored her,” he said. “She was a brilliant pianist.”
Gronowski’s first act of bravery took place many Aprils ago, when an altogether different kind of calamity was gripping Europe.
On April 19, 1943, when he was 11, Gronowski jumped out of a speeding train.
He and his mother were packed with dozens of others in a cattle wagon on the deadly route from Mechelen, a town where Belgian Jews were rounded up, to Auschwitz.
Of all the trains to doom, Gronowski’s became especially etched in Holocaust history. Known as “Convoy 20,” it was disrupted by three resistance fighters soon after departing Mechelen. In the commotion, dozens got a chance to escape into the farmlands of Flanders.
Soon after the train started accelerating again, Gronowski’s mother, perhaps emboldened by the incident and the glimmer of hope, urged him to jump off.
“I jumped because I listened to my mother’s orders,” Gronowski said. He leapt for his life. His mother did not follow.
“If I had known she was not going to jump, I would have stayed on the train,” he said, resting his cheek in his palm as if his head was suddenly too heavy.
For the next 17 months, the boy was hidden in the attics of some Catholic families. After Brussels was liberated in September 1944, he reunited with his ailing father, who had been in and out of the hospital for years, and eventually succumbed — to a broken heart, Gronowski believes — leaving the boy an orphan the following year.
Gronowski drew on the memories of prolonged confinement, the fear and desperate sadness of the 1940s, in a newspaper column he wrote as encouragement for fellow Belgians in late March as they struggled to settle into lockdown.
“Currently reduced to forced idleness, conducive to reflection, my thinking wanders and rejoins the confinements that I suffered 75 years ago, from 1942 to 1944, when I was 10-12 years old,” he wrote.
“Today, we can stay with our family or be helped by it, keep in touch, we can do our shopping, stock up on provisions, read the newspapers, watch television, but then we lived in terror, we lacked everything, we were cold, hungry and our families were separated, dislocated,” he added.
The pluckiness on display today was already burning inside the boy who had lost everything by the end of World War II.
After spending three years in foster care, he moved back into the empty family home on his own and took in lodgers to raise funds for his life and schooling.
By the time Gronowski had turned 23, he held a doctorate in law. He became a lawyer, married Marie-Claire Huybrechs, and had two daughters, Katia and Isabelle. And for six decades he said little about his perished parents, his beloved sister, Ita, or that day he jumped off a moving train on its way to Auschwitz.
“It was not a secret, but I did not talk about it,” he said, his upbeat mood momentarily darkening. “Why? Because I was feeling guilty. Why are they dead, and I am alive?”
All that changed in 2002, when, pressured by friends who knew his story, he decided to take on the past.
“I needed to bear witness and write my story, so I wrote my first book,” another act of bravery, one that gave Gronowski an unexpected new life of media appearances and a higher profile to advance progressive goals.
After “L’Enfant du XXe Convoi” (“ The Child of the 20th Convoy”) was published and Gronowski’s story became more widely known in Belgium and beyond, he started giving lectures, especially at schools.
“It was very painful to stir it all up again,” he said. “But now I feel that I am bringing something positive to young people, and it makes me happy. I am liberated.”
His newfound fame led him to another act of bravery and generosity.
A student who listened to him speak at a Belgian school in 2012 called him soon after with a stunning proposal.
A Belgian man named Koenraad Tinel, an artist of similar age to Gronowski, had written about the guilt of being born into a Nazi family. His brother had been a guard at the Mechelen camp where Gronowski and his mother had been held before being placed on Convoy 20. Would Gronowski meet with him?
The two men, both more than 80 years old at the time, met at the humble offices of the Belgian Union of Progressive Jews.
“This is how our friendship was born,” said Gronowski. “And now Koenraad is more than a friend. He is a brother.”
The two wrote a book, “Finally, Liberated,” and gave lectures together.
When the older Tinel brother, Walter, the camp guard, was on his deathbed, he asked to meet Gronowski and plead for forgiveness.
“I took him in my arms, and I forgave him,” he said. “This forgiveness was a relief for him, but it was an even bigger relief for me.”
As Belgium battles a second coronavirus wave with another lockdown, Gronowski plays his piano with the windows shut this time (“It’s a bit too cold now”) and plots future adventures. “I want to play with this band from New Orleans,” he said, brimming with boyish enthusiasm. “They’re called Tuba Skinny. They’re great!”
Most of his school lectures have been put on hold because of the pandemic, but they’ll restart soon enough, he said, and that’s what he looks forward to the most.
“When I tell my story at schools, I always finish with a message of hope. I always tell them one important thing: I tell them that life is beautiful,” he said. “But it is also a daily struggle.”

What 635 Epidemiologists Are Doing for Thanksgiving

The family of one epidemiologist plans to celebrate Thanksgiving in a garage, with tables 10 feet apart and the doors rolled up. Another epidemiologist’s family is forgoing a traditional meal for an outdoor hot cider toast with neighbors. A third is dining in an outdoor tent, with a heater, humidifier and air purifier running.
And, according to an informal survey of 635 epidemiologists by The New York Times, the large majority are not celebrating with people outside their household. Public health experts from a range of backgrounds answered our questionnaire. Not all of them study COVID-19, but all have professional training about how to think about disease spread and risk.
Seventy-nine percent said they were having Thanksgiving dinner with members of their household or not at all. Just 21% said they would be dining with people outside their household — and in most cases, they described going to great lengths to do so in a safe way. Their answers were similar for the other winter holidays, like Christmas and Hanukkah.
About 8,000 epidemiologists were invited to participate in our survey, which was circulated by email to the membership of the Society for Epidemiologic Research and to individual scientists.
The holiday season is arriving as the coronavirus spreads with renewed strength across the United States, with cases up 77% and deaths up 52% in the last 14 days. On Thursday, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to avoid travel and celebrate the holiday only with members of their household. Epidemiologists are making these same personal decisions, with added expertise.
“As difficult as it is not to be together for such occasions, we respect the virus and know that no system or level of personal protection is perfect,” said Bruce Copley, an epidemiologist who works as a private consultant and is not celebrating with anyone outside his household.
Another epidemiologist, Kendra Sims, a doctoral student at Oregon State University, is eschewing any special Thanksgiving dinner this year. “Nothing tastes as good as safety feels,” she said.
Some have coordinated with family or friends to cook side dishes, then exchange them and return home to dine alone. Some are quarantining, having no contact with others, for two or more weeks before the holiday, and getting multiple tests. Others are inviting only members of their quarantine pods — one said her pod had written “a constitution of allowable activities” to ensure they all followed the same rules. Many are resorting to a Zoom-giving.
“It’s just me, and while I usually have a place to go, this year I intend to stay home and just Skype or Zoom with family and friends instead,” said Bill Strohsnitter, an affiliate associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. “I guess that’s why the NFL gave us Turkey Day football.”
Epidemiologists stressed that their decisions depended on many factors, including the level of virus spread in their area; the degree of isolation of the people they may join; and whether they’re able to have the meal in safer ways, like outdoors.
“We will be celebrating Thanksgiving outside, using portable tables and heaters,” said Erin C. Dunn, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. “In Maine. Enough said.”
Epidemiologists are also considering personal circumstances. Several said they were inviting people who were single for dinner, or including college students returning home or relatives who were recently widowed. Some said they were trying to find a safe way to gather for their own mental health.
“Ph.D.s are lonely,” said Nina Masters, a doctoral student at the University of Michigan, who plans to travel from Ann Arbor to New York to see her parents. “I will quarantine for three full weeks — an extra, for good measure.”
In other cases, they said their own health concerns or their relatives’ age or underlying conditions were driving their decision.
“Seeing family is restorative and a source of joy,” said Danielle Gartner, a research associate at Michigan State University. But she is pregnant and said she was also weighing the risks to her health and her baby’s. “Given the spikes in cases in Michigan, we decided it best to cancel our plans to gather in person. The same is true for the Christmas holiday.”
Jennifer Kelsey, an emeritus professor of epidemiology at Stanford University, who is 78, does not plan to have a special dinner: “There is no way I would attend a holiday gathering, as I am not suicidal.”
Some said that instead of trying to recreate a traditional Thanksgiving or mourning the loss of it, they planned to do something entirely different.
“I live alone with my 5-year-old,” said Alicia Allen, an assistant professor at the University of Arizona. “We’re going to skip the normal Thanksgiving plans, which for us means a road trip, and go on a hike and picnic locally instead, just the two of us.”
Hannah Maier, a doctoral student at the University of Michigan, has devised an alternate meal. She is having a few friends over outside, and serving fall cocktails and individual savory and sweet mini pies: “Maybe we’ll incorporate some hopscotch or sprints down the block to stay warm.”
Others said that as experts in public health, with deep knowledge of how an individual’s actions can put the broader community at risk, they felt it was their responsibility to cancel plans, or else they never made them in the first place.
“Each individual has to do their part for the greater good and public health of our family, neighbors, strangers and, most importantly, the health care workers and first responders who must continue to care for the public,” said Anna Gorczyca, an assistant research professor at the University of Kansas Medical Center.
Several are focusing on the fact that it’s a short-term sacrifice, because the recent news about highly effective vaccines suggests it will be safe to gather next holiday season, if not sooner.
Mollie Wood, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Cincinnati, considered driving nine hours to see her mother, but decided to wait.
“I miss her so much, but I just couldn’t convince myself there was a safe way to do it,” she said. “So we’re going to have a video chat on the holiday this year, and plan for a big party next year.”
Other Notable Comments
Celebrating with their household:
“I would like to see my family. Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays. It’s my birthday and my dad’s, too. But I’d also really like to celebrate many future Thanksgivings with my family and birthdays with my dad. I assume others would appreciate the same. So we have absolutely no holiday celebrations with people from outside our household this year.”
— Rachel Widome, associate professor, University of Minnesota
“We were planning to celebrate with my parents, as usual, but my mother phoned last night and said that because Dr. Fauci was canceling Thanksgiving dinner with his daughters, she was canceling ours.”
— Linda Kahn, postdoctoral fellow, New York University
“Thanksgiving has the strong potential to be the start of a period of bleakness around COVID-19 the likes of which we haven’t seen yet, and we have seen some really grim times already. I am terrified of the ramifications of decisions the population as a whole is making around Thanksgiving.”
— Sarah Cohen, senior managing epidemiologist, EpidStrategies
“I feel incredibly depressed to not see my extended family this year. My newborn won’t get to see his grandparents for his first Thanksgiving. At this stage, he will spend his entire life without knowing other family members. Even as a professional, I sometimes find it hard to take. Given that as an epidemiologist, I understand the need for social distancing, I can only imagine how the general public feels.”
— Annette Regan, assistant professor, University of San Francisco
Celebrating with others:
“My elderly mother lives alone in isolation. The rest of my household will isolate for about two weeks before and be tested directly before getting together. The total number of people is six.”
— Jennifer Albrecht, associate professor, University of Maryland
“We formed a pod with another family several months ago after writing up a ‘constitution’ of allowable activities. We are all working from home and limit in-person shopping or visits with others outside the pod.”
— Christine Gille Kunitz, doctoral student, University of Minnesota
No Thanksgiving plans:
“My husband and I are welcoming a new puppy into our household over Thanksgiving weekend! With no family close to us, this is a different but a great way for our family to celebrate Thanksgiving this year.”
— Taylor Etzel, doctoral student, Johns Hopkins University
“Planning to go camping and fishing with my partner.”
— Linda Titus, adjunct professor of public health, University of Southern Maine; and professor emeritus, Dartmouth
Winter holidays:
“My household has strict quarantine plans in place and will be tested multiple times before driving to our families’ homes, where we will quarantine and test again.”
— Ruby Barnard-Mayers, doctoral student, Boston University
“Santa had better wear a mask.”
— Theodore Brasky, assistant professor, Ohio State University
“Children will interact with other neighborhood children, but adults will not interact outside the household.”
— Jay Kaufman, professor, McGill University
“It will be a tough year, but my household will not be spending it indoors with family or friends, since the worst gift we could give would be to spread COVID-19.”
— Laura Anderson, assistant professor, McMaster University

With Christmas arriving in the middle of a surging pandemic, it may not be the most wonderful time of the year for an in-person visit with Santa Claus.
And yet shopping malls, hospitals and other venues where Mr. Claus traditionally dispenses holiday cheer are scrambling to find creative ways of preserving some version of this cherished — and lucrative — holiday tradition.
It will be anything but the typical Santa experience.
Sitting on laps is out. Wish lists, once whispered into Santa’s ear, are going online. In some places, burly Santas will greet children from inside structures resembling giant snow globes. Lines of families will stretch even longer to accommodate social distancing.
Santa Claus is not just the stuff of childhood dreams. He is also big business. Visits with Santa drive traffic to shopping malls and stores that were already struggling to compete with online retailers before the arrival of a pandemic that has sickened more than 11 million Americans.
At least 134 of the more than 150 malls and shopping centers operated by Brookfield Properties are hosting Santa this holiday season, the same as last year, the company said. But the North Pole is getting an overhaul. There will be hand sanitizer stations. Santa’s elves will take on added work as cleaners. Santa himself will be available by appointment only, and from a distance.
The SoNo Collection in Norwalk, Connecticut, will plant Santa inside a snow globe. At the Park Meadows mall outside Denver, he will be perched on a raised seat in the back of his grand sleigh. Other Brookfield centers will station Santa behind a large frame or position gift boxes as a festive barrier to keep eager children at a safe distance.
At the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, children will need an appointment to visit Santa, who will interact with them from behind the window of a specially built cabin. The mall, America’s largest, will also offer online tours of Santa’s workshop.
Bass Pro Shops is erecting “Magic Santa Shields,” or transparent barriers, in its stores to separate Santa from his admirers. Elves will be mobilized as “Santa’s Sanitation Squad” to disinfect surfaces and objects, the company said, and families will have their temperatures checked. Customers are being told to follow local public health guidelines when it comes to mask use.
Santa Claus will not appear in person at Macy’s stores this year, breaking a tradition that dates to 1861. Instead, the company said it would host interactive online visits with Santa from Nov. 27 through Dec. 24. Elves will lead children on a digital journey through Santa’s North Pole village and workshop that ends with an online visit with Santa in which families can take and download a photograph, the company said.
It’s not only retailers and families who are making adjustments. Professional Santas who can earn up to $1,800 for an eight-hour peak-season commitment, according to Real Santas, a booking agency, are adapting to health restrictions to avoid the risk of infection.
“We all check most of the boxes,” said Stephen Arnold, 70, who lives in Memphis, Tennessee, but claims to be “based in the North Pole,” and has worked as a Santa Claus for decades. “We are almost all elderly, we are almost all obese and almost all have some kind of health condition. Diabetes, breathing problems, you name it.”
“So we all have to exercise an abundance of caution,” he said. “And to do that, we are joining with our previous clients and trying to get creative.”
Many Santas will still make live appearances, but the pandemic has introduced new props into their role playing. Santa hats customized with face shields, listed at $75, are going fast on the Planet Santa website, which sells gear to professional Santas.
Arnold said he planned to keep a safe distance from children at three scheduled engagements by sitting in a snow-globe-like structure, an oversize sleigh and a fire truck. He will also wear a handmade mask voluminous enough to contain his mustache and 8-inch-long beard. (Arnold, who said he earns up to $250 an hour by wrapping his 255-pound, 6-foot frame into his Santa get-up for public appearances, is a proud member of the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas.)
“We want to emphasize Christmas is going to come regardless of the current health situation,” he said. “Don’t be anxious about it; Santa is going to find a way.”
Arnold is one of the fortunate ones. With the virus raging, many Santas are finding themselves out of work this season.
Timothy Connaghan conducted a “Red Suit Survey” of many of the 4,500 or so graduates of his International University of Santa Claus and found that about 20% of the 361 Santas who replied did not expect to work at all this year.
“Because of their own health concerns they are not going to go out, or there is no work for them because everything has been curtailed,” Connaghan said.
Of the Santas who are working, many are playing it safe by going online.
One is Steve Gillham, a professional Santa who in previous years visited children in hospitals. This year he has transformed a guest room in his Chapel Hill, North Carolina, home into a studio for virtual visits.
Gillham, 65, will sit on a “Santa chair” — actually a century-old hall tree, or bench attached to a coat rack — facing an array of computer screens. When the children appear online, his wife, Debra Gillham, will be offscreen, secretly feeding him cues so he can talk to them as if he knows them, chatting about their age, hobbies and toy preferences using information provided by their parents. He will also tell stories and pull surprises out of a bag.
These Santa “smart visits” cost $75 for 15 minutes or $200 for an hour, Gillham said.
True to his Santa persona, Gillham sees a silver lining in the remote visits. Grandparents, many of whom have been separated from their grandchildren because of the risk of infection, can be invited to watch.
For many children who have accepted masks and social distancing as part of their daily lives, the prospect of a masked Santa, or a virtual visit with him, may not be surprising.
That was the case with Tammie Burdick of Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina, who in previous years had taken her children, Harper Mae, 9, and Asher, 5, to see Santa at the Umstead Hotel and Spa in nearby Cary, outside Raleigh. After months of remote schooling, she said, they understood why they will be on a Zoom call with Santa this year.
But there is still room for a little magic. The children have been told that Santa will be able to drop by their home at Christmas while they are sleeping, using fairy dust to transform their gas fireplace into one with a regular chimney.
“They ask if Santa is going to come,” Burdick said, “and I say, ‘Yes, he will be here.’”

PARIS — The French government on Friday declared it was postponing Black Friday as it moved to quell a nationwide rebellion by shopkeepers who say that Amazon has been stealing business from them during France’s coronavirus lockdown.
Black Friday, the quasi-official kickoff to the Christmas shopping season, will be delayed by a week in France, to Dec. 4, after the government wrested an agreement from Amazon and the country’s biggest retailers to delay their discounts in the country.
The move is intended to level the playing field for booksellers, clothing shops and “nonessential” businesses that were forced to close their doors Oct. 30 after a second national lockdown was imposed, propelling consumers to online sites, including Amazon.
Under the accord, big retailers agreed not to offer Black Friday sales promotions until Dec. 4 on the condition that the government permits small retailers — which have agitated since the confinement orders to be able to reopen — to resume operating before then. That would allow the smaller stores time to prepare to offer their own discounts when big competitors do.
“Let us open or let us die,” Yohann Petiot, director general of France’s Alliance du Commerce, a trade group for businesses, told government officials this week.
The spectacle of one of Europe’s largest countries scrambling to protect its retailers from Amazon highlights the difficulties governments are facing as they try to strike a balance between enforcing a second round of shutdowns amid pandemic fatigue and preventing retailers that don’t have the same deep pockets as big corporations from collapsing into mass bankruptcies.
In France, the episode has ignited a fresh backlash against the U.S. online giant. Since it arrived in 2000, Amazon has become a favorite in France, capturing nearly half of online spending in 2019. Sales in France jumped nearly 50% from a year ago during the most recent lockdown, the company said.
But rapid growth has turned Amazon into a symbol of a dominant multinational that detractors say is importing unwanted American-style consumerism as well as job instability and environmental degradation to the eurozone’s second-largest economy.
In the lead-up to the announcement Friday, the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, and other politicians urged shoppers not to give Amazon their business.
The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, circulated an online petition titled “Noël Sans Amazon” (“An Amazon-free Christmas”). Addressed to Santa Claus, it commits signatories to a “#ChristmasWithoutAmazon,” which is described as a tax-dodging Grinch that destroys small businesses, jobs and the environment in France.
The virtual call to arms, however, quickly fell victim to an online hack that overloaded the website with fake signatures sent from more than 200 different servers, including hundreds in the name of Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, with the comment, “Sorry, not sorry, Jeff.”
The scramble by French politicians to sooth the ire of small businesses reopened a broader controversy over Black Friday itself, which wasn’t even an event in Europe until a few years ago when it was ushered in mainly by Amazon, which began promoting major sales in lockstep with those in the United States.
While the American Thanksgiving is just another Thursday in Europe, Black Friday has thrived. In Britain, Spain and other countries, Amazon and other big retailers already started offering Black Friday discounts online earlier this month.
France has been slower than other European countries to join the trend, and politicians have discouraged shoppers from participating, warning of “a frenzy of consumption” in which people are encouraged to buy products they don’t need. The fact that Amazon is not a French company did not help, either.
Yet Black Friday has been a crucial tool for retailers to top up sales. Last year, retailers in France raked in an estimated 6 billion euros in revenue around Black Friday.
Those sales are more crucial than ever this year as retailers faced unprecedented losses from lockdowns linked to the coronavirus pandemic. Although stores reopened from June through September, that was not enough to fully compensate for France’s first lockdown; year-to-date sales are still, on average, 10% below their 2019 levels, according to an analysis by German bank Allianz.

Climate Change Is Making Winter Ice More Dangerous

New research on the connection between climate change and winter drownings has found that reported drowning deaths are increasing exponentially in areas with warmer winters.
The study, published Wednesday in the journal PLoS One, looked at drownings in 10 countries in the Northern Hemisphere. The largest number of drownings occurred when air temperatures were just below the freezing point, between minus 5 degrees Celsius and 0 Celsius (between 23 degrees Fahrenheit and 32 Fahrenheit).
Some of the sharpest increases were in areas where Indigenous customs and livelihood require extended time on ice. Across the countries studied, children under the age of 9 and teenagers and adults between 15 and 39 were the most vulnerable to winter drowning accidents.
Sapna Sharma, an associate professor of biology at York University in Toronto and a lead author of the study, said people did not always realize how global warming is increasing the risks that come with winter traditions like skating, ice fishing and snowmobiling.
“I think there’s a disconnect between climate change and the local, everyday impacts,” Sharma said. “If you think about climate change in winter, you’re thinking about polar bears and ice sheets, but not about these activities that are just ingrained in our culture.”
Those ingrained habits can lead to a false sense of security, Sharma said.
“It might be minus 20 Celsius today and tomorrow and the weekend, but last week it was 15 Celsius,” she said. “Well, we might have forgotten as individuals that it was warm and sunny last week on a Tuesday, but the ice didn’t forget.”
The lack of sustained cold, which leads to more freeze-thaw events, is crucial. Each time ice thaws and refreezes, it gets a little weaker — and it can stay that way for the remainder of the cold season.
“Milder temperatures mean that the ice is not as thick, or not as solid as it would otherwise be,” said Robert McLeman, a professor of geography and environmental studies at Wilfrid Laurier University who was not involved in the study. “And so people are going out onto it and not realizing that the ice is rotten.”
The authors compared death records and temperature data in Canada, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Finland, Russia, Sweden, Italy, Japan and the northern United States. They analyzed about 4,000 total records over a span of 26 years, though the time period varied depending on the available data in each country.
The researchers found that more cold-weather drownings occur in spring, when daily low temperatures increase too much to support stable ice structures. At the same time, those warmer temperatures make it more enjoyable to spend time outdoors, meaning more people are spending time on ice.
Northern Canada and Alaska have higher rates of drowning, even in very cold temperatures. Sharma said that is probably because people there simply spend more time on the ice. Indigenous communities close to the Arctic rely on waterways for food and transportation, which means more time on the ice in winter and an increased risk of drowning.
The coronavirus pandemic could also put more people at risk.
“If this winter is anything like this summer was,” Sharma said, “a lot of people spent time in cottage country in Ontario because we just can’t go anywhere.”
She said that ice with sitting water, slush or holes in the surface was generally unsafe.
“Snow cover is when it gets tricky,” Sharma said. “People think there’s so much snow on the ice, the ice must be thick,” but snow can also act as insulation, melting the ice more quickly.
“We need to, as individuals, adapt our decision-making,” she added, and focus on how changing winters affect rivers, lakes and streams. “It may not be as safe now as it was 30 years or 40 years ago.”

Texto completo: The claim: Sen. Lindsey Graham reached out to officials in Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, and 'tried to manipulate vote counts'
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a prominent ally of President Donald Trump, made headlines this week after a series of phone calls to elections officials in three pivotal states: Georgia, Nevada and Arizona.
His actions prompted indignant posts on Facebook from the left-leaning page Occupy Democrats.
"In addition to Georgia, Lindsey Graham admits he also tried to manipulate vote counts in Nevada and Arizona to help Trump," its post reads. "Just another member of the self-proclaimed Party of Law and Order proving he really has no respect for Law and Order."
Occupy Democrats has not responded to a request from USA TODAY for comment.
Georgia secretary of state said Graham asked him to 'see how many ballots you could throw out'
On Monday, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told the Washington Post that he spoke with Graham onNov. 13 about the state's signature-matching laws.
Raffensperger said Graham asked him if political bias might have influenced poll workers to accept ballots with nonmatching signatures. Graham also inquired as to whether Raffensperger had the power to toss mail-in ballots in counties with high rates of nonmatching signatures.
To Raffensperger, it appeared that Graham was suggesting he find a method to throw out ballots that had been lawfully cast.
“It sure looked like he was wanting to go down that road,” Raffensperger told the Post.
That night on CNN Politics, Raffensperger provided more details about the call.
"He asked if the ballots could be matched back to the voters," he said. "I got the sense it implied that then you could throw those out for any, if you look at the counties with the highest frequent error of signatures. So that's the impression that I got.
"It was just an implication of, 'Look hard and see how many ballots you could throw out,'" Raffensperger added.
Graham pushed back, said he just wanted to understand state laws
Graham said it was "ridiculous" to claim that he suggested Raffensperger should toss legal ballots. He said he simply wanted to understand the state’s signature-matching requirements, per the Washington Post.
“The main issue for me is: How do you protect the integrity of mail-in voting, and how does signature verification work?” Graham said. “If he feels threatened by that conversation, he’s got a problem. I actually thought it was a good conversation.”
He also said on CNN Politics that he was "surprised" to hear how Raffensperger interpreted their conversation.
"What I'm trying to find out was how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention?" Graham said. "So like when you mail in a ballot, you got to have some way to verify that the signature on the envelope actually matches the person who requested the ballot."
"It seems to me that Georgia has some protections that maybe other states don't have, where you go into the portal to get your ballot," he added.

A witness to the conversation backs Georgia secretary of state
On Tuesday, Gabriel Sterling — the election implementation manager in Georgia, who works under Raffensperger and participated in the call — told CNN Politics that he heard Graham ask about the possibility of tossing ballots, too.
"What I heard was basically discussions about absentee ballots and if a potentially ... if there was a percentage of signatures that weren’t really, truly matching, is there some point we could get to, we could say somebody went to a courtroom could say well, let’s throw (out) all these ballots because we have no way of knowing because the ballots are separated," Sterling said.
Sterling said the comments "might have gone a little to the edge of" what others deem acceptable, but said he understood why Raffensperger and Graham had different interpretations of their conversation.
Legal experts told The New York Times that it was doubtful that Graham’s actions could lead to criminal charges or represented a violation of the ethics rules that govern the Senate.
Still, three attorneys filed a complaint about the matter to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press.
The complaint was filed by Walter Shaub, a former top ethics watchdog for the federal government under President Barack Obama; Richard Painter, the top ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush; and Claire Finkelstein, who heads the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law.
What about Nevada and Arizona?
On Tuesday, while speaking with reporters in the U.S. Capitol, Graham said he had also spoken with officials from Nevada and Arizona.
“Yeah, I talked to Arizona, I talked to Nevada,” he said, per Politico.
Graham said he was speaking with the officials in his capacity “as a United States senator who is worried about the integrity of the election process nationally, when it comes to vote by mail.”
"If we're going to expand voting by mail, which we probably will, I want to make sure that we're taking the precautions necessary to validate signatures like we do if you show up on Election Day," he said.
Graham said his central question was who verifies the signatures, per USA TODAY.
He also defended his right to ask for more information on state laws, per CNN Politics.
"What I'm very concerned about is that if you're going to continue to vote by mail that we need to know what systems work and what don't," Graham said. "It's up to the people of Georgia. I think I have every right in the world to reach out and say how does it work? And that's what I did."
Unlike Georgia, it was not immediately clear to whom Graham had spoken in Arizona and Nevada.
Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs tweeted that she had not spoken with him, and Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske released a similar statement.
Graham later clarified that he spoke with Arizona’s Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, not Hobbs. As for Nevada, he said he had been and had been "briefed about what they do in Nevada" but could not "remember by who."
Patrick Ptak, a spokesman for Ducey, told the Arizona Republic that the call with Graham was simply to learn more about the state's process.
“He was calling about the certification process for ballots and Arizona’s system. Senator Graham has been praiseworthy of Arizona and our process," Ptak said in a phone interview. "He did not ask for anything, to my knowledge. It was a call about how Arizona does things."
Our rating: Partly false
Based on our research, the claim that Sen. Lindsey Graham "tried to manipulate vote counts" in Georgia, Arizona and Nevada is PARTLY FALSE. It's true that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Graham appeared to suggest he find a method to throw out ballots that had been lawfully cast, though Graham disputes that characterization. It's also true Graham also made calls to officials in Arizona and Nevada, but no one — including one of the officials he spoke with — suggested that he "tried to manipulate vote counts" in either state.

Texto completo: When grad students of the future write dissertations on the worst presidential transitions in American history, I have a feeling 2020 will get a lot of attention.
True, nobody seceded from the union. But it's a bad sign when the president refuses to admit he's lost reelection, then abruptly fires the defense secretary and a top cybersecurity official.
The incoming Biden administration has been frozen out of ... just about everything. Most of the top guys on the Trump team are keeping a low profile. Those who aren't remind us every day why we should be very, very worried about who's in charge.
Rudy Giuliani is supposed to be leading the fight to keep Donald Trump in office despite the minor detail of his having lost the election. Challenging the vote count in Pennsylvania, Giuliani told a judge that the plaintiffs were "denied the opportunity to have an unobstructed observation and ensure opacity."
Tick tock.
"I'm not quite sure I know what opacity means," the president's top lawyer continued. "It probably means you can see, right?"
"It means you can't," the judge responded.
Details, details. "Big words, Your Honor," Giuliani said.
Sounds like a Worst winner, right? Actually, few of the more than 3,000 voters picked Rudy as the Worst member of the Trump orbit despite his very high entertainment quotient. Our discerning readers are less disturbed by the incompetent fools Trump surrounds himself with than the thin line of appointees efficient enough to actually do some damage.
And the winner is ...
Attorney General Bill Barr!
"Didn't Barr win this last time?" wrote Terence, a reader in Portland.
Well, actually his other victories were in the Worst Cabinet Member competitions. But there's definitely something that distinguishes Barr from the rest of the pack. "Although not the craziest, he is definitely the most dangerous," as Terence put it.
Barr is a big, big advocate of presidential authority. (Perhaps you remember his efforts to undermine the Mueller report.) His first response to Trump's suggestion that he hadn't really lost the election was to call on his own department to investigate claims of voter fraud. The underling given the job quit immediately.
Second Worst place went to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who got particular mention for his response to a question about whether State is preparing to work with the Biden transition team. "There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration," Pompeo said, grinning, during a briefing last week. "All right? We're ready."
"Ordinarily I would go with Barr," wrote Carole from Lake Worth, Florida. "But I am switching my vote to Pompeo this time. Just because of that stupid smirk. And the destroying democracy thing."
Emily Murphy, the head of the General Services Administration, is most definitely a new face in the Worst Olympics, but she won a place in the finale by refusing to sign the required paperwork that Joe Biden had won the election.
Without her cooperation, the incoming administration can't get funds for transition or access to federal agencies where it will work.
Murphy came in third, a stellar achievement for a federal official who's never been in contention for Top Awful before. Michael McAllister of New York felt Murphy was mainly an example of missed opportunity. "Unencumbered by any adolescent male macho thought disorder and lacking the public notice the others have accrued, she could have quietly done the right thing. It would be a welcome irony to have the only woman in the list show some courage and integrity."
The Trump team does not do irony. "It is always nice to see a Cinderella story of a scrappy newcomer rocketing to the top of the corruption heap," mused Dan from Madison.
Following Murphy - by write-in vote! - was Mitch McConnell. There's something about the Senate majority leader that drives a lot of people crazy, and I'd be willing to predict that if the Republicans maintain a tiny majority in the Senate, McConnell will be the obsession of every American who voted for Biden.
Giuliani came in only fifth. But canny Times readers are aware that his awfulness is matched only by his ineptitude. The fact that Trump has put him in charge of his fight against the election results is ... very good news for people who want to keep the election results.
Rudy is reportedly asking for $20,000 a day for his efforts, which is quite a hunk of money for a guy whose highest-profile recent business venture was pushing a brand of cigars. Seeing him fight with Trump over the bill would make the president's retirement extra satisfying.
Mike Pence came in way down at the bottom with only 5% of the votes. But he still has his advocates. "For his rictus smile, his wax museum poses, his performance at the solo debate, his LEADERSHIP of the COVID task force, his 20% approval rating in Indiana before the election, his Baghdad Bob imitation, and for just being Mike Pence," wrote Johnnyd from Pennsylvania.
And finally, thanks to all the readers who wrote in to say that picking the Worst of the Trump gang was impossible. "This is like trying to pick the best Beatles song," protested a voter in Phoenix.

Texto completo: Friday's episode of "The New York Times Presents" is different: It was conceived, produced and edited entirely during the pandemic.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It's weird living in a box. But for many of us, that's how we've spent this year. We Zoom. We FaceTime. We tweet. I went for a walk the other day and realized that I have largely stopped using my peripheral vision. Is there even a world outside the glowing rectangle?
I'm a producer/director for our FX and Hulu documentary series "The New York Times Presents," and Friday's episode, which I directed, is the first one that our team conceived, produced and edited entirely during the pandemic (that was not about the pandemic itself). The show profiles Graham Ivan Clark, a 17-year-old from Tampa, Fla., who is accused of carrying out this summer's high-profile hack of Twitter.
To pull it off, we needed, well, boxes. Shedding the long-held tradition of loading several hundred pounds of equipment onto a plane and jetting across the country to interview sources, we commissioned local cinematographers who lived near our subjects. We sent them a kit that included a teleprompter and an iPad. Once affixed to the front of the camera, the image on the iPad would be displayed in front of the camera lens. That meant this handy contraption would allow an interviewee to look directly into the lens and, instead of seeing a dark void, they would see me. In my living room. In a box.
It was basically a 4K broadcast-quality video chat.
And so we dispatched the cinematographers -- sometimes with a single assistant -- to locations around the country, where they did the job of a typical five-person crew. But even with such a small crew, protocols were necessary to avoid exposing anyone on set to the virus. That meant simple things like wearing masks and washing hands. It also meant airflow, which posed a new challenge.
Any sound recordist will tell you that airflow is the enemy of quality sound. Fans, HVACs, even refrigerators -- the cardinal rule of sound is to turn them off and shut them out. Otherwise, those noises are amplified and delivered to a viewer's living room when they watch the final product. But in this case, our specific protocols required us to film outdoors or in a well-ventilated room with windows open. In one location, that meant hearing the constant buzz of highway traffic. Fortunately, sound mixing technology has also improved, allowing the mixer to isolate and reduce these noises without losing the overall fidelity of the interviewee's voice. What a world.
But perhaps most befitting of this year was the day disasters collided. We had booked a studio in Oakland, Calif., but learned that the interview subject had been near someone who had been exposed to someone else who had tested positive for the coronavirus. The interviewee scheduled a coronavirus screening to be sure he wasn't infected, but it was unclear whether the test results would come back in time for the shoot. And so we switched to an outdoor location nearby.
But on the morning of the shoot, Oakland awoke to an air quality index rated "unhealthy" by the Environmental Protection Agency. Record-setting wildfires were tearing their way through California and the American West, sending towering plumes of smoke into Oakland and the surrounding area.
After an agonizing couple of hours overthinking which option was less dangerous -- prolonged smoke inhalation or potential coronavirus exposure -- we got the news: Our subject had tested negative. We were clear to move back inside. But with all the smoke floating around the studio, we had to crank the fans -- audio be damned.
For the remainder of the interviews, we benefited from the fact that the film focuses on the online world of teenage hackers. After first making contact with members of this community on apps like Discord or Signal, we scheduled interviews with them over voice chat. We disguised their identities by using facial recognition technology -- the same kind of thing you use to put rabbit ears on yourself when recording selfies on Snapchat.
As this endless year drones on, we all continue to reinvent how we work. And while we have learned some new tricks and gotten creative with emerging technologies, I for one am counting down the days until I can get out of this box.

250,000 Deaths, and Still Zero Teamwork

Texto completo: Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died. Coronavirus cases are surging again. There's still no federal plan.
Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.
Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.
The United States passed another grim milestone on Wednesday, when the coronavirus death toll topped 250,000.
Cases of the virus are rising in every state but Hawaii. Hospital conditions are worsening by the day, with patients cramming into cafeterias and parking garages. It's likely that every American will soon know someone who has been infected.
Our graphics department even debuted a new color -- a dark purplish red -- on The New York Times's online coronavirus case map to capture the record rates of infection.
Yet, in the face of this entirely anticipated crisis, Washington is doing very little. After so many months of this tragedy, there is still no coordinated federal response to the virus.
"The general strategy is abdication," said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with Georgetown University, who says it's possible that as many as 300,000 more Americans could die of the virus before Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. "There are going to be a lot of unnecessary deaths, a lot of unnecessary cases of Covid that didn't need to happen."
There are no signs of any change in strategy coming from the current administration.
President Trump is more focused on litigating a settled election than combating the virus. Since Election Day, he's held one public event -- an update on his administration's effort to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine. Other than traveling to his golf course, the president has remained holed up inside the White House.
At the same time, the government he leads has been offering mixed messages.
On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that Americans avoid traveling and gathering with relatives for the Thanksgiving holiday. And later in the day the White House coronavirus task force held its first news conference in months, urging Americans to remain vigilant as they wait for a vaccine. But on Wednesday, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, called some local guidelines limiting Thanksgiving gatherings "Orwellian." (States that have imposed fewer virus containment measures now have the worst outbreaks, according to a New York Times analysis.)
And Congress once again left town this week without any kind of economic relief deal. Politico reported that Senate Republicans did not even discuss a stimulus package at their weekly lunch.
The lack of federal coordination has left state and local governments to pursue a patchwork of measures, while public health officials face continued skepticism from some Americans who still doubt the severity of the virus -- some even from their hospital beds.
Europe provides an alternative vision: After several weeks of lockdowns, new cases seem to be slowing in Germany and France. (Both countries kept schools open.)
A number of public health experts have said that another round of temporary shutdowns will be the only way to slow the spread of the virus in the United States, too. Without economic relief from Congress, though, new restrictions could plunge millions of Americans and small businesses into even more financial peril.
None of this should come as a surprise. Throughout the summer and fall, experts repeatedly warned that the colder months would bring worsening conditions as people were forced indoors. "Winter is coming," they practically shouted.
Of course, change is also coming in Washington. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s transition team is developing plans to deal with the virus. But Inauguration Day is nearly nine weeks from now.
"People need to really manage their expectations about this because without question, he has a tremendous challenge," Ms. Rasmussen said of Mr. Biden. "There will be some things he can do on Day 1, but they're not necessarily going to make an immediate impact."
Mr. Biden has promised an aggressive national approach that includes pushing for mask mandates, providing economic aid to local governments, helping to manage the distribution of a vaccine, expanding testing and rebuilding support for public health agencies. "There is a real desire for a real partnership between the states and the federal government," Mr. Biden said Thursday after meeting with a bipartisan group of governors.
But his ability to plan those steps is already being hampered by the refusal of a Trump administration appointee to sign the paperwork that would grant Mr. Biden's transition team access to funds, equipment and government data.
Once Mr. Biden is in office, his effectiveness will greatly depend on the relationships he can build with Republican governors and a closely divided Senate -- a task that he has already admitted will be a challenge.
The sad reality is that the mounting death toll could help Mr. Biden's efforts, Ms. Rasmussen said. Those grim numbers could finally change attitudes toward the virus, prompting more Americans to adopt measures like mask wearing and social distancing.
"I like to think that most people presumably don't want Americans to be dying en masse, or have seen how it has affected their own families," she said. "It's very grim and horrible, but if anything good can come out of it, it might be that when Biden is sworn into office people are more willing to take the pandemic seriously."

From Opinion: A casualty of 'Trump Derangement Syndrome'?
Early in President Barack Obama's first term, it became clear that run-of-the-mill partisan suspicion of Democrats expressed by Republican voters and politicians had morphed into a more severe state: Obamacare wasn't just bad, it was going to bring about death panels; Mr. Obama wasn't just misguided in wanting a more generous welfare state, he was secretly shuffling "Obama phones" to the undeserving poor.
In response, the 44th president's defenders coined the term Obama Derangement Syndrome -- which at times felt a bit over the top until poll after poll showed that many Republicans believed numerous conspiracies about the first Black president.
Figures like Tucker Carlson on the political right have since counterpunched by accusing Democrats of Trump Derangement Syndrome, a condition best explained by this view in The Wall Street Journal: "In Stage Three, one is ready to believe anything -- anything pernicious or salacious, that is -- about Mr. Trump and to reject anything he has done that might be good for the country." Symptoms also apparently include "obsession with the president's hair and comparing him to Mao."
While four years of reporting has shown that many of the pernicious and salacious acts Mr. Trump has been accused of are indeed true, it is also true that he has garnered such disdain from the left that opposition to him can sometimes be reactionary and not entirely based in fact.
On Wednesday, the Times Opinion columnist Nicholas Kristof took stock of the harm this dynamic has wrought on the issue of school reopenings in blue cities and states across the country.
"Some things are true even though President Trump says them," he wrote. "Trump has been demanding for months that schools reopen, and on that he seems to have been largely right. Schools, especially elementary schools, do not appear to have been major sources of coronavirus transmission, and remote learning is proving to be a catastrophe for many low-income children."

... Seriously
Former Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin turned 79 today, which prompted him to crush a birthday cake with a bowling ball. (To promote coronavirus testing, of course.)

Texto completo: " Belushi " is a documentary portrait of actor John Belushi: essentially an oral history - including never-before-heard clips from audio interviews with the comedian by Tanner Colby, co-author of the book "Belushi," and selections from Belushi's letters, read by Bill Hader. Supplemented by a trove of archival photos and footage and some animated reenactments, the film, written and directed by R.J. Cutler ("A Perfect Candidate"), tracks Belushi's life and career, from his youth in Chicago and early work with the Second City comedy troupe to his work on "Saturday Night Live," subsequent films and 1982 death, at age 33, from a drug overdose. This is all well-covered ground, but the film does offer, for fans of the performer, some insights into what Belushi himself refers to as his "occasional melancholy despair." As expressed by his friend Carrie Fisher, who also struggled with addiction and mental illness, for the both of them - and perhaps many others - "drugs aren't the problem; sobriety is the problem." TV-MA. Available Sunday on Showtime. Contains strong language, nudity and drug material. 108 minutes.
- Michael O'Sullivan


The ever-prolific, ever-curious Alex Gibney has another new documentary: " Crazy, Not Insane " is structured around a long conversation - or, more likely, several long conversations pieced together - with Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a forensic psychiatrist with a focus on murderers. In his fascinating discussions with Lewis, author of the book "Guilty by Reason of Insanity: A Psychiatrist Probes the Minds of Killers," Gibney doesn't merely revisit the circumstances of grisly killings perpetrated by such people as Ted Bundy - although he does do that - but he interrogates the very notion of legal insanity (which, as the film's title suggests, is not the same thing as being crazy.) To its credit, the film also goes much further, examining the putative deterrence of the death penalty and, most intriguingly, the psychology of one person whose job it is to perform executions. As always, Gibney raises some excellent, troubling questions, not all of which can easily be answered. Unrated. Available on HBO and HBO Max. Contains strong language, bloody crime scene photos and discussion of violence. 114 minutes.
- M.O.


" Leap of Faith: William Friedkin on 'The Exorcist' " is a real treat for fans of the Oscar-winning 1973 horror film about demonic possession. Clearly a fan himself, director Alexandre O. Philippe sat down with Friedkin for a chat about the film. And Friedkin, as it turns out, has much to say about the making and meaning of it. He offers the kind of insights - it's a movie about the "mystery of faith," he says - and the kind of behind-the-scenes details one typically finds on a DVD commentary track, but with much more thoughtfulness: Friedkin says he was guided by a strange mix of unconscious intuition and supreme confidence in making "The Exorcist" - what he calls a kind of "sleepwalker's security," borrowing a phrase from filmmaker Fritz Lang. After watching this film-school chat, some may want to revisit "The Exorcist" with fresh eyes. Unrated. Available on Shudder. Contains strong language, scary images, blood and violence. 103 minutes.
- M.O.

" Coded Bias " is a documentary about racial bias in facial recognition software.

Contains violence, strong language, sexuality and nudity. 98 minutes.

Mel Gibson plays Santa Claus - you read that right - in " Fatman ," an action comedy in which Gibson's Chris Cringle faces off against a deadly assassin (Walton Goggins).

Available on various streaming platforms; also playing at the CMX Cinemas Village 14. Contains bloody violence and strong language. 99 minutes.

Jackie Chan plays a prisoner trying to escape from the jailer of the Tower of London (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in " Iron Mask ."

Jude Law plays an English businessman whose life takes a disturbing turn when he moves to a country manor with his American wife (Carrie Coon) and family in " The Nest ." Law and Coon aren't the only reason to see the film, writes Rolling Stone, "but they are the main reason to see it, and both of them give these characters so much shared history communicated without saying a word." R. Available on various streaming platforms. Contains crude language throughout, some sexuality, nudity and teen partying. 107 minutes.

The controversial billionaire activist George Soros is the subject of the sympathetic documentary " Soros ." According to Variety, "For somebody who's seen by many as being in line to ace the Antichrist primaries, Soros comes off as nearly as much of a regular guy as someone could who still has a Hungarian accent and may rank among the 1-percent's top 1 percent."

" The Twentieth Century " is a twisted take on Canadian history that mixes fictional elements with actual historical figures. "The jokes are often ridiculous, as is pretty much everything else that happens," according to the Hollywood Reporter, "but there's a palpable energy and visual inventiveness on display that keeps things watchable." Unrated. Available at afisilver.afi.com. 90 minutes.

Good wine can be balm for this Thanksgiving

Texto completo: In this strange and disquieting year, Thanksgiving planning begins with the question of whether to have any sort of gathering at all. Which wines to drink with the meal will be the least of your worries.
That's as it should be. Selecting wines may cause a mild quiver of anxiety, but it's never really a problem.
Even in the best of times, when you're embracing aunts, third cousins and your best friend's sister's daughter, the joy of the feast and the renewal of ties go a long way toward mitigating the quality of whatever happens to be in your glass.
Still, good wine can be a significant asset. It can compel guests to take notice, to pause and ponder rather than gulp and disregard. If bottles are to be opened, why not select them with the same diligence you apply to choosing the perfect recipe for mashed potatoes?
Thanksgiving comes as COVID-19 cases are spiking nationwide. Every family will decide how to approach this often joyously rambunctious holiday. Many gatherings will be diminished as people, protecting their loved ones and themselves, decide not to travel or entertain. Thanksgivings for four, or two or even one will not be unusual.
Somehow, families will manage to bridge the distance. Whether through Zoom or the phone, people will find a way to share their blessings, maybe through a prayer or a toast. Wine can help forge these links, possibly by opening the same bottles from afar.
Our wine panel was not immune to the 2020 winnowing. Typically, we assemble monthly in a room at The New York Times building, where we consider and discuss a range of bottles. In deference to the pandemic, we have not gathered since February.
Still, we did not want to let Thanksgiving pass, so we got together outdoors, in the rooftop space of the NoMad restaurant in Manhattan. Even so, we were not entirely whole. Bernard Kirsch, our tasting coordinator, always joins us, but this year he opted out. Our colleague Pete Wells, like so many parents dealing with home-schooling, faced a last-minute child-care issue and could not attend.
That left Florence Fabricant, Julia Moskin and me, so we invited Thomas Pastuszak, NoMad's wine director, to contribute a couple of bottles. We would be tasting eight wines in all.
We stuck with our usual ground rules: Each of us would bring two wines, one white and one red. None would retail for more than $25. We adopted these guidelines years ago, believing that for big gatherings, nobody wants to spend a lot of money on wine.
Smaller gatherings offer different opportunities. You don't need as much wine, so if you like you can open your finest bottles.
Dinner for four, for example could begin with hors d'oeuvres and sparkling wine.
It could be Champagne. But if you want to emphasize American wines, I have found wonderful choices from the West Coast: Blue Ox, Cruse, Schramsberg, Iron Horse, Soter and Under the Wire are a few names worth knowing about.
Follow that with a good white wine, whatever strikes your fancy. Chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, riesling, all will be great, but don't stop there. You might like an assyrtiko, or maybe a carricante. Maybe you're beginning with a creamy soup? Any of these wines will work, as long as they are not too oaky.
I would follow up with a red - a pinot noir or syrah, or maybe a Barolo or a Beaujolais. Whether serving turkey, or downsizing to a duck or chicken, these are all flexible with wine, so match the bottle to your sense of the occasion rather than with the food.
Maybe you would prefer two whites, or no whites at all. Why not? This is the year to eliminate rigid constraints.
Even so, the wine panel stayed with its philosophy of seeking out lithe, agile wines. If you have followed us over the years, you will have seen the recommendations for many different specific bottles - Beaujolais, Loire reds, Italian reds, Oregon pinot noirs, rosés, sparklers and even ciders.
These all continue to be great choices. But we have come to realize that the specifics don't matter nearly so much as the character and energy of the wines. Acidity, balance and relatively low alcohol are the watchwords.
We have gotten good at finding bottles that fit these criteria, and this year was no exception. In fact, all eight bottles earned three stars, the equivalent of excellent choices. What separates them are scant degrees of preference. They were all that good.
For her white, Julia brought a Côtes du Rhône blanc, a 2019 Clémentia from Domaine les Aphillanthes, made from biodynamically farmed viognier, roussanne and clairette.
This was a counterintuitive wine, as viognier in particular can be overbearing, but this was well-focused and lively, a "sunny wine," Julia said, that offered its tropical fruit flavors without being too heavy.
Her red was our favorite, a 2018 Verduno Basadone from Castello di Verduno, made of pelaverga piccolo grapes organically farmed in the Langhe region of Italy.
While the area is best known for its Barolo and Barbaresco, Langhe also grows pelaverga piccolo, one of a group of lesser-known grapes that offer excellent values. It was fresh, bright, spicy and intriguing.
Florence, too, went against the grain with her white, selecting a so-called orange wine, a white with some of the characteristics of a red.
Many orange wines can seem idiosyncratic, and I often wonder whether people will want to drink them over the course of a long meal. This would be a good candidate to try.
Her red was a nonvintage pinot noir, the High Wire from Hound's Tree on the North Fork of Long Island - fresh, lively and refreshing.
I loved Thomas' white, a 2018 Mosel riesling from Julian Haart that was textured and rich with floral and stony mineral flavors. I called it a wake-up wine for the way it snapped me to attention, though Julia suggested it was maybe too bold.
Thomas' red came from Franck Balthazar, one of my favorite Cornas producers, who also has a small négociant operation. This 2018 Côtes du Rhône is 60% syrah and 40% grenache, farmed organically. It was spicy, earthy and complex, a lovely wine.
I stuck with American wines for my picks. My white, a 2018 Sonoma County chardonnay from Lioco, was tangy, textured and balanced, the sort of white wine that will go with almost anything.
My red was the 2017 Queen of the Sierra from Forlorn Hope, a blend of trousseau noir, mondeuse, zinfandel and a few other grapes, all organically grown in Calaveras County in the Sierra Foothills.

GOP women brought the energy to congressional races

Texto completo: A week before Election Day on Nov. 3, the New York Times offered a grim preview of the fate of Republicans in House races. Democrats had “fortified their grip on hard-fought seats won in 2018 that allowed them to seize control of House,” the outlet said. And that freed them to concentrate on Republican incumbents in “once-solid foothills in suburban districts, where many voters have become disillusioned with Mr. Trump.”
Democrats were rolling in money. In highly competitive races, they were “sitting on a 5-to-1 cash-on-hand cash advantage” over their Republican opponents and “overall were poised to spend nearly twice as much on television ads from Labor Day to Election Day.” They even had spare cash to use against Republicans in Alaska and Montana.
Republican strategists didn’t bother to deny how bad things looked. “The Democrats’ green wave in 2018 has turned into a green tsunami in 2020,” Corry Bliss told the New York Times. GOP advisers, who are supposed to know how to win elections, “privately forecast losing anywhere from a handful of seats to as many as 20.”
That was a very big mistake, since Republicans flipped 12 Democratic House seats and maybe a few more once vote counting is finished. How could this happen? The wise strategists and the media missed what became obvious late in the final weeks of the campaign. They were dumbstruck. They might as well have blamed the weather.
The focus of the election had changed. Democratic leftists eager to “defund the police” and impose socialism had become their party’s voice. They were front and center. As their further-to-the-left allies rioted, Democratic “leaders” stood by passively. And the press remained fixated on President Trump.
I have two explanations for what caused the collapse by the Democrats. One was human nature. Everything was going their way. They could get the best advice. They hired the top ad men and campaign experts. They had money to burn.
This is, as God warns, exactly when you let up and money takes control. You lose your edge. Democrats have long complained about the evil of money in politics. Now, they can fund every cause and candidate. And the complaints about money have stopped. With money in charge, the body and mind relax. You get lazy.
The second explanation is like a great rookie on a declining sports team who stirs and inspires, almost like magic. Republicans in the House have been rejuvenated by a group of female candidates. They are responsible for flipping nine of the 12 Democrats ousted by Republicans. They aren’t lazy.
As the House Democratic caucus began filling up with women, Republicans got in the game. Winning for Women was formed in 2017 to counter EMILY’s List, the pro-abortion Democratic group. Rep. Elise Stefanik, elected from upstate New York in 2014, set up a PAC to elect Republican women. With Tom Emmer of Minnesota as chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee, the effort has taken off. The push for women candidates is no longer ignored by the press.
Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is an advocate. “We had challenges with women,” he told the New York Times’s Jonathan Martin. “We had a low number of women in Congress. It’s not just getting women to run; you’ve got to get through the primaries … I spent more effort on recruitment.”
McCarthy engaged “early in the races. Because it’s harder for women and minorities to win in a primary than in a general election.” The party, he insists, “is going to be more diverse. We’re not more diverse today, but we are going to be. We’re on the path.”
It helps to be a tough breed, and the rookies who won on Nov. 3 are. They aren’t neophytes. Maria Elvira Salazar, a former broadcast journalist for Telemundo, beat Democrat Donna Shalala, an ex-secretary of Health and Human Services. She has a Cuban background, as does Carlos Gimenez. Both won House seats in Miami.
Victoria Spartz, an immigrant from Ukraine, ran for an open seat in the ritzy suburbs of Indianapolis. An Indiana state senator since 2017, she was a long shot. The New York Times story touted her Democratic opponent Charlotte Hale, endorsed by Planned Parenthood and EMILY’s List. Spartz has a 100% pro-life voting record, like nearly all the Republican winners. She won by 4 percentage points.
Michelle Steel and Young Kim booted Democrats from their seats in Orange County, California. Both are Korean Americans. And Nancy Mace, the first female graduate of The Citadel, the military college in
South Carolina, unseated the favored incumbent Democrat, John Cunningham.
Republicans are a half-dozen or so short of a House majority. With a few more women on board, Republicans can watch Nancy Pelosi exit the floor for the last time. No tears from Republican women will drop.

Bipartisan push to strip the names of Confederate leaders from Army bases imperils critical defense policy bill

Texto completo: TRUMP’S VETO THREAT LOOMS LARGE: It was a scene that was all mask-covered smiles and bonhomie at yesterday’s traditional “pass the gavel” ceremony on Capitol Hill, as the bipartisan leadership of the Senate and House Armed Services committees met with conferees who will iron out differences in the two versions National Defense Authorization Act for the current fiscal year.
Each year the gavel is rotated between the House and Senate, with this year Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, chairman of the HASC, handing over the gavel to Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe, chairman of the SASC.
“The ‘pass the gavel’ meeting continues the bipartisan, bicameral spirit that has long been a trademark of the NDAA,” said Inhofe, predicting the defense policy bill will pass for the 60th year in a row.
“The Armed Services Committees represent one of the last true bastions of bipartisanship, and our ability to produce legislation each and every year is proof that the legislative process still works,” said Smith.
INHOFE PUSHES TO DROP BASE NAME PROVISION: But behind the scenes, Inhofe is pressing for the conference committee to strip the final bill of a provision that passed both chambers with wide bipartisan support, a requirement that the Army rename 10 domestic bases that honor Confederate leaders from the Civil War.
Inhofe reportedly issued an ultimatum Monday night, telling lawmakers that the requirement would have to be stripped from the bill to avoid a veto by President Trump, who has vowed to never allow the bases to be renamed.
The New York Times reports Inhofe has privately promised the president that he would get the provision scrapped, citing “two people familiar with the private discussion.”
SPOILING FOR A FIGHT: Democrats are not in the mood to give in to the lame-duck president over an issue that easily won approval on both sides of the aisle on both sides of the Capitol.
“This summer, the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis passed NDAAs with provisions to begin the process of changing the names of military bases and infrastructure named after individuals who served in the Confederacy,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. “It is imperative that the conference report include provisions that secure this essential priority. Our bases should reflect our highest ideals as Americans.”
“I don’t think we should back away from our values and what we stand for,” Maryland Democratic Rep. Anthony Brown, an Army veteran, told the New York Times. “I don’t think we should turn a blind eye to what would be viewed by many as a perpetuation of a racist symbol in a name, simply because he threatens to veto the Defense Authorization Act.”
BIDEN COULD CHANGE THE NAMES ANYWAY: The provisions were designed to force the hand of Trump, who believes the names are part of America’s heritage and that renaming the bases would erase history.
But should the language be stripped from the final bill, nothing would prevent President Biden, once he takes office, from ordering the Army to rename the bases. It’s also possible that the final passage of the NDAA could be delayed until after Biden is president.

HAPPENING TODAY: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will meet behind closed doors to hear testimony about the Trump administration’s proposed $23 billion weapons sale to the United Arab Emirates, including 50 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets and 18 Reaper drones.
Testifying in a closed session will be R. Clarke Cooper, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs; Timothy Alan Betts, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs; Joey Hood, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; and Joel Starr, deputy assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.
Democratic Sens. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, along with Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, are seeking to block the sale, introducing four separate resolutions of disapproval.
“Congress must strongly assert its statutory authority over our nation’s foreign arms sales,” said Menendez in a statement. “As I tried to warn the Trump administration, circumventing deliberative processes for considering a massive infusion of weapons to a country in a volatile region with multiple ongoing conflicts is downright irresponsible.”
ELEVATION OF SOCOM: Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller announced yesterday that he is elevating special operations forces to the same level as other military departments under authority granted by the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act.
In remarks at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Miller directed the assistant secretary of defense for special operations/low-intensity conflict to begin reporting directly to him. The position is currently filled on an acting basis by Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a former aide to Trump’s first national security adviser Michael Flynn.
“For nearly four years, the Department of Defense has planned and prepared to implement this important legislation,” Miller said. “It not only strengthens the role of the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict as a senior civilian for special operations within the department, but it also reinforces the partnership with the commander of the United States Special Operations Command.”
ARMY LOSING BATTLE AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT: In a video statement released yesterday, a contrite Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy admitted the Army’s SHARP program has been a failure.
SHARP, an acronym for Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention, is the Army’s effort to end sexual harassment and sexual assault within its ranks.
“I am deeply saddened and concerned by the recent news reports of how sexual assault and sexual harassment have plagued our force and brought harm to our Soldiers,” said McCarthy, citing but not revealing the results of an investigation of the climate at Fort Hood, Texas.
“My preliminary review of the report, recent cases, and recent media coverage have hardened my belief that the Army’s SHARP program hasn’t achieved its mandate to eliminate sexual assaults and sexual harassment by creating a climate that respects the dignity of every member of the Army family,” said McCarthy. “On Dec. 8, we plan to release the findings with an action plan to address the recommendations.”
“It is abundantly clear, we must do better,” he said, “It is clear we have significant work to do to regain our soldiers’ trust.”
MILITARY POISED TO DISTRIBUTE VACCINE: As COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. passed a quarter million yesterday, Army Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operations officer of Operation Warp Speed, promised that as soon as vaccines are approved, the military will ensure its quick delivery to “the whole of America.”
“Our experts that know how to distribute vaccine, as they do every year annually for influenza, as they've done for H1N1,” Perna said at a briefing, promising “fair and equitable distribution of the vaccine throughout the country simultaneously.”
“There is no haves and have nots. It is an equitable distribution, and we are driving hard to make sure that that happens,” Perna said. “We are working with commercial industry, the experts in this field, those that know how to produce, store, distribute, and administer the vaccine accordingly. They do this every day. This is the United States of America.”
“We now have two safe and highly effective vaccines that could be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and ready to distribute within weeks,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. “By the end of December, we expect to have about 40 million doses of these two vaccines available for distribution pending FDA authorization, enough to vaccinate about 20 million of our most vulnerable Americans, and production, of course, would continue to ramp up after that.”

Texto completo: (JNS) Israeli operatives shot al-Qaeda’s second in command on the streets of Tehran on behalf of the United States, intelligence officials told The New York Times in a report published on November 13th.
Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, who went by the nom de guerre Abu Muhammad al-Masri, was one of the planners of the 1998 attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was shot in his car, together with his daughter Miriam, by two people on a motorcycle on Aug. 7, the anniversary of the attacks. His daughter was the widow of one of the sons of Osama bin Laden.
Al-Masri was on the F.B.I.’s Most Wanted Terrorist List and had been indicted in the United States for the embassy attacks. The Times quoted a former Israeli intelligence official as saying that al-Masri had continued to oversee Africa operations, and had ordered the 2002 attack in Mombasa, Kenya that killed 13 Kenyans and three Israelis.
Iran denied the report on November 14th.
“From time to time, Washington and Tel Aviv try to tie Iran to such groups by lying and leaking false information to the media in order to avoid responsibility for the criminal activities of this group and other terrorist groups in the region,” said the Iranian foreign ministry, according to Reuters.
American intelligence officials say that al-Masri had been living in an upscale suburb of Tehran since 2015, according to The New York Times.

Gail Collins: Barr the bad or Rudy the ridiculous?

Texto completo: When grad students of the future write dissertations on the worst presidential transitions in American history, I have a feeling 2020 will get a lot of attention.
True, nobody seceded from the union. But it’s a bad sign when the president refuses to admit he’s lost reelection, then abruptly fires the defense secretary and a top cybersecurity official.
The incoming Biden administration has been frozen out of ... just about everything. Most of the top guys on the Trump team are keeping a low profile. Those who aren’t remind us every day why we should be very, very worried about who’s in charge.
Rudy Giuliani is supposed to be leading the fight to keep Donald Trump in office despite the minor detail of his having lost the election. Challenging the vote count in Pennsylvania, Giuliani told a judge that the plaintiffs were “denied the opportunity to have an unobstructed observation and ensure opacity.”
Tick tock.
“I’m not quite sure I know what opacity means,” the president’s top lawyer continued. “It probably means you can see, right?”
“It means you can’t,” the judge responded.
Details, details. “Big words, Your Honor,” Giuliani said.
Sounds like a Worst winner, right? Actually, few of the more than 3,000 voters picked Rudy as the Worst member of the Trump orbit despite his very high entertainment quotient. Our discerning readers are less disturbed by the incompetent fools Trump surrounds himself with than the thin line of appointees efficient enough to actually do some damage.
And the winner is ...
Attorney General Bill Barr!
“Didn’t Barr win this last time?” wrote Terence, a reader in Portland.
Well, actually his other victories were in the Worst Cabinet Member competitions. But there’s definitely something that distinguishes Barr from the rest of the pack. “Although not the craziest, he is definitely the most dangerous,” as Terence put it.
Barr is a big, big advocate of presidential authority. (Perhaps you remember his efforts to undermine the Mueller report.) His first response to Trump’s suggestion that he hadn’t really lost the election was to call on his own department to investigate claims of voter fraud. The underling given the job quit immediately.
Second Worst place went to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who got particular mention for his response to a question about whether State is preparing to work with the Biden transition team. “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,” Pompeo said, grinning, during a briefing last week. “All right? We’re ready.”
“Ordinarily I would go with Barr,” wrote Carole from Lake Worth, Florida. “But I am switching my vote to Pompeo this time. Just because of that stupid smirk. And the destroying democracy thing.”
Emily Murphy, the head of the General Services Administration, is most definitely a new face in the Worst Olympics, but she won a place in the finale by refusing to sign the required paperwork that Joe Biden had won the election. Without her cooperation, the incoming administration can’t get funds for transition or access to federal agencies where it will work.
Murphy came in third, a stellar achievement for a federal official who’s never been in contention for Top Awful before. Michael McAllister of New York felt Murphy was mainly an example of missed opportunity. “Unencumbered by any adolescent male macho thought disorder and lacking the public notice the others have accrued, she could have quietly done the right thing. It would be a welcome irony to have the only woman in the list show some courage and integrity.”
The Trump team does not do irony. “It is always nice to see a Cinderella story of a scrappy newcomer rocketing to the top of the corruption heap,” mused Dan from Madison.
Following Murphy — by write-in vote! — was Mitch McConnell. There’s something about the Senate majority leader that drives a lot of people crazy, and I’d be willing to predict that if the Republicans maintain a tiny majority in the Senate, McConnell will be the obsession of every American who voted for Biden.
Giuliani came in only fifth. But canny Times readers are aware that his awfulness is matched only by his ineptitude. The fact that Trump has put him in charge of his fight against the election results is ... very good news for people who want to keep the election results.
Rudy is reportedly asking for $20,000 a day for his efforts, which is quite a hunk of money for a guy whose highest-profile recent business venture was pushing a brand of cigars. Seeing him fight with Trump over the bill would make the president’s retirement extra satisfying.
Mike Pence came in way down at the bottom with only 5% of the votes. But he still has his advocates. “For his rictus smile, his wax museum poses, his performance at the solo debate, his LEADERSHIP of the COVID task force, his 20% approval rating in Indiana before the election, his Baghdad Bob imitation, and for just being Mike Pence,” wrote Johnnyd from Pennsylvania.
And finally, thanks to all the readers who wrote in to say that picking the Worst of the Trump gang was impossible. “This is like trying to pick the best Beatles song,” protested a voter in Phoenix.

Nicholas Kristof: When Trump was right and many Democrats were wrong

Texto completo: Some things are true even though President Donald Trump says them.
Trump has been demanding for months that schools reopen, and on that he seems to have been largely right. Schools, especially elementary schools, do not appear to have been major sources of coronavirus transmission, and remote learning is proving to be a catastrophe for many low-income children.
Yet America is shutting schools — New York City announced Wednesday that it was closing schools in the nation’s largest school district — even as it allows businesses like restaurants and bars to operate. What are our priorities?
“I have taught at the same low-income school for the last 25 years, and, truly, I can attest that remote schooling is failing our children,” said LaShondra Taylor, an English teacher in Broward County, Florida.
Some students don’t have a computer or don’t have Wi-Fi, Taylor said. Kids regularly miss classes because they have to babysit, or run errands, or earn money for their struggling families.
“The amount of absences is mind-blowing,” she said.
Adeola Whitney, chief executive of Reading Partners, an outstanding early literacy program, referred to the traditional “summer slide” in which low-income students lose ground during the summer months and told me: “The ‘summer slide’ is now being dwarfed by ‘COVID slide’ projections.”
Granted, the United States has done such a poor job of controlling the virus that as the pandemic rages across the country it may be necessary to shut some schools. But that should be the last resort.
I’ve been writing since May about the importance of keeping schools open, and initially the debate wasn’t so politicized. But after Trump, trying to project normalcy, blustered in July about schools needing to open, Republicans backed him, and too many Democrats instinctively lined up on the other side. Joe Biden echoed their extreme caution, as did many Democratic mayors and governors.
So Democrats helped preside over school closures that have devastated millions of families and damaged children’s futures. Cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., have closed schools while allowing restaurants to operate.
It’s true that Trump was simply trying to downplay the virus. If he wanted schools open, he should have fought the pandemic more seriously and invested federal money to help make school buildings safer against the virus’s spread.
Yet today, while we all want in-classroom instruction, the practical question is whether to operate schools that don’t have optimal ventilation and other protections. The United States has answered by shuttering many schools and turning to remote learning even as many businesses have stayed open or reopened. Much of Europe pursued the opposite route, closing pubs and restaurants but doing everything possible to keep schools operating — and the evidence suggests that Europe has the smarter approach.
In both Europe and the United States, schools have not been linked to substantial transmission, and teachers and family members have not been shown to be at extra risk (this is more clear of elementary schools than of high schools). Meanwhile, the evidence has mounted of the human cost of school closures.
“Children learn best when physically present in the classroom,” notes the American Academy of Pediatrics. “But children get much more than academics at school. They also learn social and emotional skills at school, get healthy meals and exercise, mental health support and other services that cannot be easily replicated online.”
One child in eight in America lives with a parent with an addiction — a reflection of America’s other pandemic. I’ve seen kids living in chaotic homes, and for them the school building is a refuge and a lifeline.
America’s education system already transmits advantage and disadvantage from one generation to the next: Rich kids attend rich schools that propel them forward, and low-income children attend struggling schools that hold them back.
School closures magnify these inequities, as many private schools remain open and affluent parents are better able to help kids adjust to remote learning. At the same time, low-income children fall even further behind.
“Students are struggling,” Austin Beutner, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, where more than four-fifths of students live below the poverty line, told me. “And if you’re not becoming proficient in reading in first, second, third grade, you may face a lifetime of consequences.”
Research from Argentina and Belgium on school strikes indicates that missing school inflicts long-term damage on students (boys seem particularly affected, with higher dropout rates and lower incomes as adults). McKinsey & Co. has estimated that in this pandemic, school closures may lead to 1 million additional high school dropouts.
Dropouts live shorter lives, so while the virus kills, so do school closures. One study this month estimated that closures of primary schools in the United States will cause many more years of life lost, because of increasing numbers of dropouts, than could be saved even if schools did spread the virus freely.
Across the country from Taylor’s classroom in Florida, Lauren Berg is an elementary school principal in McMinnville, Oregon. Berg said some students flourish with distance learning, but three or four students in each class struggle to attend regularly.
The school tries everything: It gives out Chromebooks, hot spots, headphones, even personal timers with meeting times prescheduled with alarms. Teachers drop off food and school supplies, or sit in driveways to try to get pupils to log in to the system. “Even with all of this,” Berg said, “we are still missing some students.”
Let’s follow Europe: Close bars, and try harder to keep schools open.

Millions of people have spent far more time at home than they expected to this year. It’s made many of them daydream about what it might be like to live somewhere else, often while scrolling through listings on Zillow.
“I go into neighborhoods that obviously I can’t afford as a college student and look at my ideal house and fantasize about when this is all over,” said Crystal Silva, 20, who lives in North Carolina. She spends hours at a time surfing the app, touring homes she’ll never buy.
She’s likely not alone in that. Zillow usage has climbed since March, with online visitors to for-sale listings up more than 50% year-over-year in the early months of the pandemic.
People bond over listings on Discord servers, group chats and “Zillow Twitter,” and their obsession has made many strange and obscure listings go viral. Curbed, a website covering city life, real estate and design, recently started a column called My Week in Zillow Saves, in which people (myself included) share the homes they’ve admired on the site.
What many are contemplating when they browse Zillow and similar home buying sites — like Redfin, Trulia and Realtor.com — is not necessarily a purchase, but an alternate life. Zillow surfing has become a primary form of escapism for those who want to flee not just their homes but the reality of 2020.
Ione Damasco, 45, an academic librarian in Ohio, said that she started to open up Zillow every day on her lunch break not long ago. “It’s a really personal thing,” she said. “It’s me daydreaming about what’s possible down the road. Right now I feel like the future is so uncertain, there’s something therapeutic about searching houses and starting to make plans for something with a positive outcome. It makes me think there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and someday I’ll be at my dream house.”
The amount of data Zillow provides, some say, is key in aiding their fantasies. While platforms like Pinterest and Instagram offer an endless stream of beautiful interiors, Zillow provides images, data, video tours and highly detailed information on each house. It’s easier to picture your future when you have access to the floor plan of the space or know which school your children would attend if you lived there.
Some will go to great lengths to find new and interesting houses. “I’ll see a house on Instagram then go to Google Maps to try to find the house using street view, then go to Zillow to look up what it’s currently worth, who bought it and historical price data,” said Kelsey Steele Cooper, 24, a hotel manager in Arkansas. “I’d like to think that hasn’t become my hobby, but I’ll use three different apps to take a look at this house that’s 1,000 miles away from me. That’s how much time we have on our hands in 2020.”
The pandemic has also upended many people’s priorities when it comes to housing; even those who’d never thought about moving now dream of more space or a backyard. Jenny Xie, an editor at Curbed, said many people who weren’t previously looking for a home are now considering moving or have broadened their housing searches.
“You hear about friends or friends of friends moving,” Xie said. “If your friend recently bought something it’s like, ‘Oh, let me see what I can get two hours outside of New York.’ Suddenly you’re exploring possibilities.”
Houston, Dallas and Atlanta are now hot housing markets, according to data provided by Zillow. Traffic to listings in those cities has jumped 88% from last year.
That said, most Zillow surfers simply enjoy the hunt.
Tucker Boner, 27, began streaming Zillow hunts on Twitch nearly three years ago, and has seen a bump in interest since the pandemic. He said the majority of his viewers are young millennials or members of Gen Z, people who may never have the independent means to purchase a home. “This isn’t a 9-to-5-job-and-everyone-gets-a-home kind of economy,” he said.
The sheer absurdity of listings also makes for engaging content. “It’s really fun to have a virtually unending supply of very interesting things to look at,” Boner said. “There’s always going to be someone with too much money and too much creativity that results in some Frankenstein of a home.”
Zillow surfing is especially popular among teenagers. A TikTok meme over the summer consisted of users talking about knowing where the bathrooms were in their friend’s or crush’s house before ever visiting it because they had toured all of their classmates’ homes on Zillow. Many young people have extensive lists of saved homes and discuss and share listings with friends.
“We don’t have control over where we live because most of us live in our parents’ home,” Silva said, “so being able to create this world where I pick where I live and what house I live in regardless of price is fun.”
After Ariel Norling, 29, a designer in Oakland, California, made a name for herself on Zillow Twitter by identifying unique, enviable listings around the country, she started a weekly house-hunting newsletter on Substack called I Know A Spot. “I’ve always been a Zillow scroller,” she said, “but it’s been a big activity for me as a part of quarantine. I felt like I was running out of things to do, Zillow felt like a different kind of outlet.”
Ali Zaidi, 40, an attorney in Boston, prefers Redfin over Zillow, and has made checking the site part of his morning routine, despite the fact that he has no plans to buy a house. “It’s part of my morning,” he said. “I log into my work email, check different media outlets, then one of the websites I open up is always Redfin.”
He compared the serotonin rush of seeing beautifully staged homes to checking social media and seeing pictures of people’s private lives. “I get the same sort of joy from looking into Redfin as I do on Facebook or Instagram,” he said. “I find it interesting and almost voyeuristic.”
What makes Zillow different from those social networks, though, is the absence of people, writer Brian Feldman noted in his newsletter, BNet, this summer. “It has no engagement loop, no social interactions, no real network effects to speak of,” he wrote. “It is a giant canvas onto which people project their desires and insecurities, and a constantly evolving document not just of the housing market, but of how people lived.”
Though the site hasn’t delved into social networking yet, many users have begged Zillow to add a comment section where surfers can connect and bond over listings.
“I think for a lot of people, Zillow feels like the opposite of doomscrolling,” Norling said. “You’re stuck in your apartment, maybe you can’t move, but it’s easy to look at listings and imagine yourself in a different life. And maybe in that life COVID isn’t happening.”

The Trump administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, appearing at the White House with other top federal health officials for the first time in months, issued a dire assessment of the pandemic Thursday, along with an urgent warning for Americans to “increase their vigilance” as they await the approval of a vaccine.
Dr. Deborah L. Birx made the remarks after the White House coronavirus task force met with Vice President Mike Pence — who offered a far rosier assessment as he defended the administration’s handling of a pandemic that has now claimed more than 250,000 lives in the United States, and killed nearly 2,000 Americans on Wednesday alone.
“America has never been more prepared to combat this virus than we are today,” Pence declared, adding: “We approach this moment with the confidence of experience. We know the American people know what to do.”
The late-afternoon news conference, in the White House briefing room, came after President-elect Joe Biden denounced President Donald Trump’s “incredible irresponsibility” in contesting the results of the presidential election and delaying the beginning of a transition process. Biden singled out the administration’s refusal to grant his team access to its planning for vaccine distribution.
Calling the vaccine distribution effort “one of the greatest operational challenges we will have faced as a nation,” Biden said, “There is no excuse not to share the data and let us begin to plan.”
The White House briefing offered a stark reminder of the toll the pandemic has taken on the nation and of vast disconnect between Trump and Pence and the federal health officials who advise them. Even as Birx implored Americans to wear masks — and stood at the lectern wearing one as she spoke — Pence greeted reporters with his face uncovered.
Birx, who has a penchant for data, came armed with sobering statistics. Flipping through a series of charts, she displayed a map of the United States that was a vast expanse of bright red — a signal that the entire country, with the exception of the East and West coasts, is being crushed by the virus.
The briefing, nine months into the pandemic, amounted to a full-court press by an administration that, despite its success in helping develop two promising vaccine candidates, has been knocked back on its heels by the virus.
A string of top officials appeared, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease specialist; Health Secretary Alex M. Azar II; Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Gen. Gustave F. Perna, who is coordinating logistics for the vaccine effort; and Dr. Elinore F. McCance-Katz, the head of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration. (Dr. Scott Atlas, Trump’s lightning rod coronavirus adviser, was not, however, in evidence.)
Fauci sought to reassure Americans about the two vaccines nearing approval, saying that neither scientific integrity nor safety had been compromised. “We need to put to rest any concept that this was rushed in an inappropriate way,” he said. “This is really solid.”
Turner pledged that the government would begin distributing the vaccines within 24 hours after they receive emergency approval from the Federal Drug Administration. He did not mention that the doses will be scarce at first, and that the vaccines do not take effect right away.
One of the vaccine developers, Moderna, has said it will have 20 million doses ready by the end of 2020; the other, Pfizer, said it would have about 50 million by then — half for Americans. Both vaccines require two shots, so 20 million doses would be enough for 10 million people.

A man wanted on homicide charges in connection with the recent discovery of the skeletal remains of three people in a remote Colorado town was arrested Thursday at a motel in Gallup, New Mexico, the authorities said.
The man, Adre Jordan Baroz, 26, of Sanford, Colorado, was arrested without incident after a manhunt and was to be taken to the McKinley County Detention Center in Gallup, about 140 miles west of Albuquerque, near the Arizona border, the authorities said.
Baroz, who goes by the nickname Psycho, faces charges in Colorado of first-degree homicide, first-degree assault and second-degree kidnapping, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.
Members of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Colorado Springs found Baroz in Gallup, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. It did not elaborate.
He was arrested one day after the authorities said they were searching for him in connection with the discovery last week of the remains of three people in Los Sauces, a tiny town in Conejos County, Colorado, near the New Mexico border, about 270 miles northeast of Gallup.
The authorities have not said how they connected Baroz to the remains, and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said the warrant charging him with homicide had been sealed.
Colorado law enforcement officials said they had discovered the first set of remains Nov. 10 after they went to a property near Los Sauces to execute a search warrant for stolen vehicles and equipment. That discovery led them to more remains on a nearby property, on Nov. 13.
Officials declined to describe the properties but said they were not owned by Baroz.
George Dingfelder, the chief of police in Monte Vista, Colorado, said Wednesday that a forensic anthropologist had confirmed that the remains were human. But the authorities said they did not know how the people had died, how old they were, their gender or how long the remains had been on the properties.
Dingfelder said it could take weeks or months to identify the victims.
At a news conference Wednesday, law enforcement agents had warned that Baroz could be armed and said they were working urgently to take him into custody. They said they had set up a hotline to collect tips and had formed a task force to investigate the case.
“It is imperative that we get this individual off the street,” Ken Anderson, the chief of police in Alamosa, Colorado, said at a virtual news conference Wednesday. “When I say he’s a danger to the community, I mean exactly that — he’s a danger.”
Officials said the discovery of the remains had shaken residents of Conejos County, which is home to about 8,000 people, many of them farmers and ranchers.
“Obviously, we don’t see cases like this very often,” Anderson said.
Los Sauces is home to about 25 people and has no businesses and only one road leading to it, according to Larry Crowder, the state senator who represents the area.

Unemployment Claims Rise as Economic Worries Grow

The job market is showing signs of weakening again, as more Americans file for unemployment benefits amid a sharp rise in coronavirus cases and new restrictions on business aimed at curbing the outbreak.
Initial claims for state employment insurance jumped by more than 18,000 to over 743,000 last week, before adjusting for seasonal factors, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It was the first increase since early October and represented an ominous turn for a labor market that has struggled to recover fully from the huge layoffs that accompanied the pandemic’s arrival in March.
“The latest data points to the fragility of the recovery as the COVID crisis worsens,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “If this trend continues, it’s an indication that the labor market recovery has gone into reverse.”
New claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance — a federal program for gig workers, independent contractors and the self-employed — totaled 320,000, an increase of 24,000 from the week before.
Although the economy rebounded strongly in the third quarter and overall unemployment fell to a seasonally adjusted rate of 6.9% in October, that momentum has faded in the absence of new aid from Washington.
The latest wave of the outbreak threatens to further devastate big employers like airlines, restaurant chains and hotels, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging Americans on Thursday to avoid traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Mobility — in terms of walking, driving and use of public transportation — is already showing a decline, as are restaurant bookings, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management.
“If people are staying home, that means they are not shopping or going out, and that means less employment,” he said.
What’s more, two emergency federal programs to aid people thrown out of work by the pandemic are scheduled to expire at the end of next month.
A new study by the progressive Century Foundation found that 7.3 million workers would lose their benefits with the end of Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. An additional 4.6 million will be cut off from Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, which kicks in when state employment benefits run out.
The programs represent “the last lifelines available to millions of Americans in desperate need,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow with the Century Foundation and co-author of the study with Elizabeth Pancotti. “It will be a crippling end to one of our darkest years.”
A separate study by the California Policy Lab, a research group working with state and local governments, reported that nearly 45% of California workers had filed for unemployment benefits since March, with 83% of the Black labor force applying during that period. Many of those workers are back on the job, but the end of the two programs will affect 750,000 Californians.
A new aid package from Washington would provide critical support for the economy, according to many economists. But stimulus legislation has been held up by differences over its scale.
On Monday, President-elect Joe Biden called on the two parties to “come together” and enact a stimulus package along the lines of a $3 trillion proposal passed by the Democratic-controlled House. The Senate’s Republican leadership backs a $500 billion outlay.
For all the body blows of the last year, consumer demand remains relatively healthy, according Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. “We are still seeing incredible strength in housing, and auto sales remain strong,” she said. “Consumers are still spending on bigger-ticket items.”
Sales of existing homes rose last month at the highest rate in 14 years, the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday, fueled by rock-bottom interest rates that have encouraged house hunters to borrow and buy.
The Dickensian elements of the COVID-19 economy — unemployed workers facing a cutoff in benefits even as other Americans buy houses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars or more — underscore the unevenness of the recovery.
Lower-paid service workers have been hit especially hard, and the rise in virus cases threatens new pain. White-collar workers have fared better, with the unemployment rate for college graduates standing at just 4.2%.
Even for workers who have found jobs, the economy presents forbidding challenges. Some, like Christopher Crystal, have had to settle for paychecks that are a fraction of what they used to earn.
Crystal, 45, was furloughed in March from his job as a logistics manager at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where he worked for 11 years and oversaw a staff of 500.
His furlough turned into a permanent layoff in September, and the $400 he was receiving each week in state unemployment benefits was not nearly enough to cover his family’s monthly bills, including $1,500 in rent for their apartment in Long Island, a $250 car payment and $250 for car insurance.
As his credit card bills grew, Crystal started looking for a job that would pay him more than his unemployment benefits.
In early October, he found a job as a delivery driver for Amazon. But he is earning $40,000 annually instead of his old $70,000 salary — and the job requires him to work 10- to 12-hour shifts lifting heavy boxes.
“I’ve been taking all the overtime they can give me just to try to catch up,” he said.
Crystal is glad to have a job, which has provided extra cash to buy clothes for his 5-year-old son. But he still feels mired in debt from the bills that stacked up while he was out of work.
“Now our savings are depleted, and my credit score has dropped like crazy,” he said. “It will take us a long time to dig ourselves out of this hole.”

NEW YORK — It’s never just about the food.
From modest ethnic restaurants with dishes redolent of home to classic diners where the sever knows your name and has your order in by the time you’re seated, one of the most appealing items at restaurants around New York isn’t always on the menu: community.
That is just one of the many losses that New Yorkers and restaurateurs alike have endured in the months since the pandemic sent the city into a lockdown. Empty dining rooms preceded layoffs, leading restaurants to beef up their takeout and delivery services as they struggled to find ways to coax back nervous diners.
Outdoor dining has helped, but the cooler weather and an increasing infection rate have owners wondering how they’ll manage — let alone survive — the coming months.
The New York Times visited two restaurants that in their own ways have convened community: Joloff, a Senegalese restaurant in Brooklyn, and the Riverdale Diner, a Bronx institution. Apart from missing busier and better times, their owners are waiting to see what local officials will do next.
Riverdale Diner, Kingsbridge, the Bronx
Any diner can offer country-fresh eggs for breakfast. The Riverdale Diner goes one further and lets you choose the country whose style you prefer: from Mexico’s huevos rancheros to Dominican-style eggs with mashed plantains smothered with red onions. And yes, for those who remember the diner’s earliest years in the north Bronx — not far from Gaelic Park — an Irish breakfast is still served.
Having a menu that appeals to everyone was much simpler when the diner opened in 1967, when the neighborhood was heavily Irish and Jewish. But as the city changed, so did the diner’s offerings.
“We always had a menu for everyone,” said Anna Kaperonis, who opened the Riverdale Diner with her husband, George. “We try to do a little for everybody, and as the years went on, we added more items.”
On a recent rainy morning a server with masks and gloves went from table to table taking orders and refilling cups of coffee before vanishing behind the counter and through the swinging kitchen doors. The large main dining room was empty, as was the tented area set up in the parking lot. In the kitchen, workers cooked and prepared food for deliveries.
“When the pandemic came, we got an unexpected vacation,” said Gustavo Barrera, 22, as he swiftly bagged takeout meals. “Now I have to work harder to pay my debts.”
Since reopening, only half of the 40-person staff has been brought back, said Joe Daka, the diner’s manager. They now work three days instead of five, which helps keep more people employed.
“We have some workers who have been here for 35 years,” Daka said. “Some of them moved. Some of them got stimulus checks. But they have kids; they want to eat. Thank God we’re still open.”
The extensive menu offered by large restaurants like the Riverdale Diner, while a draw for its customers, has its own cost, since such a wide range of ingredients has to be kept on hand.
“People like diners because they can have whatever they want when they want it,” Anna Kaperonis said.
While not a problem when the diner was at maximum capacity of 205, the owners are now considering trimming the menu to save money.
And as the weather gets colder, they will take heaters outside to encourage dining there. But that’s a stopgap measure.
“Hopefully, they’ll allow 50% capacity,” she said. “Then we hope for the best, hope we find a vaccine, and everybody gets on with their lives once again.”
Joloff , Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn
At Joloff — named for the West African rice dish — staffing is a family affair. Soon after moving to New York from Senegal in 1990, Papa Konare Diagne started selling food he prepared in his apartment to Rastafarian friends.
His success in selling meals from home led him to open a restaurant in Bedford-Stuyvesant with his wife and siblings in 1995.
After 17 years, gentrification and rising rents drove him to his current location, in the same neighborhood, where he has walls covered in art and tables arrayed before a slightly raised stage.
“Since I opened, we did a lot of spoken word, exhibits and drumming,” he said. “This was oriented around culture and community.”
But since the pandemic hit, the stage has fallen silent. Gone, too, are the private parties to celebrate naming ceremonies, weddings and birthdays.
“I just can’t have too many people in here at one time,” Diagne said. “I’m here with my family, but I care more about their health than money.”
Those community-oriented activities, as much as the food, had helped Joloff attract a diverse clientele.
“We’ve had a younger generation from the Middle East and South Asia, too,” he said. “They’re very curious about the food.”
That curiosity was Diagne’s entree to offering tours of Senegal and establishing a sister city relationship between Brooklyn and Goree Island, off the Senegalese coast, where enslaved Africans were herded onto ships bound for the Caribbean and the Americas.
“Taking people to visit the motherland was always an extension of the restaurant,” he said. But the tours, along with a festival he organized in Senegal, have been canceled for now.
Diagne is now trying to find ways to save money, including hiring his own delivery person with scooter rather than relying on app-based services that take a hefty cut.
“I hope to have more deliveries,” he said, “because that’s where the business is going to be.”

Resumen: Inaccurate claims on election fraud by Federal Election Commission Chair Trey Trainor — who is not the top US election official — have spread online.

Texto completo: The claim: Federal Election Commission Chair Trey Trainor calls election 'illegitimate,' and said voter fraud is taking place.
In the past week, comments that Federal Election Commission Chair Trey Trainor made have spread online as purported evidence of voter fraud and illegitimacies in the recent election.
RecentlyHeard.com, a news website, wrote that "The Chief Electoral Officer of the Federal Election Commission made a Bombshell statement, saying that, from what he saw in Pennsylvania, and news that he had come from elsewhere in the world, this election was unconstitutional."
"It’s not just anyone’s making the announcement. Trey Trainor isn’t just a state election officer, he’s a federal officer. And on top of that, he’s the chairman of the whole commission," its story continued.
Users on Facebook, like Joseph Sherbert and Duane Engdahl, also posted about Trainor and his remarks.
"It really is explosive news. The top boss of all the election officials, Trey Trainor, has confirmed that in his professional opinion, 'there has not been transparency in the election' and 'this in election is illegitimate,'" Sherbert wrote.
Engdahl shared an image that read, "When the Chief of the Federal Elections Comission says, 'Election fraud has taken place' then you better believe that election fraud has taken place."
RecentlyHeard.com, Sherbert and Engdahl have not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.
Trainor's claims of election fraud echo baseless allegations made by President Donald Trump and his campaign. Trump has refused to accept the election's results and insists without evidence that a wide conspiracy has robbed him of victory.
Who is Trey Trainor, and what is the FEC?
Trainor is the chair of the Federal Election Commission. He is not its "Chief Electoral Officer," as RecentlyHeard.com wrote — that role doesn't exist.
The Federal Election Commission is tasked with enforcing federal campaign finance laws. Its duties include monitoring restrictions and limits on campaign contributions, and overseeing public funding for presidential campaigns, per USA.Gov.
The FEC only oversees finances and is one of multiple federal bodies that deals with elections — so it's not accurate to call Trainor the "top boss of all the election officials," or to suggest he supersedes state officials.
In reality, elections in the United States are "highly decentralized," and are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single national system, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.

"States typically have primary responsibility for making decisions about the rules of elections (policymaking)," the report explains. "Localities typically have primary responsibility for conducting elections in accordance with those rules (implementation)."
In fact, in his appearance on Newsmax, Trainor acknowledged that he had not been briefed on the matter.
"We really haven't been briefed on any of it given that we don't — you know, the states control the elections and the FEC really doesn't have any jurisdiction over how these are being handled at the state level," he said. "For the federal level, they would communicate through the Election Assistance Commission."
(U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Ben Hovland called false claims about the election "baffling," "laughable" and "insulting," per CNN.)
Trainor is a Republican lawyer who advised Trump in 2016.
He was nominated by Trump in 2017, though he was not confirmed by the Senate until May 2020, according to the Washington Post.
In September, Trainor called the upcoming contest between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden a "spiritual war."
"It is striking at the underlying foundations of our constitutional republic,” he said, per the Washington Post. “It’s getting rid of the Christian moral principles that are the basis of the foundation of the country."
What did Trainor say about the election?
In his nearly six-minute interview on Nov. 6, Trainor made a number of claims about the validity of the election, including the comments referenced by RecentlyHeard.com, Sherbert and Engdahl.
First, he claimed that "observers have not been allowed into the polling locations in a meaningful way," and called the election "illegitimate" as a result.
"State law allows those observers to be in there, and if they're not, the law is not being followed, making this an illegitimate election," Trainor said.
Second, he said he believes voter fraud took place.
"I do believe that there is voter fraud taking place in these places," Trainor said. "Otherwise they would allow the observers to go in."
He added that the "political system is based upon transparency," and that "there has not been transparency in this election."
Third, he claimed that Democrats controlled all the states considered too close to call.
"In every instance we have here where the states are too close to call, they're controlled by the Democrat Party, particularly in the urban areas where they're being counted," he said.
It's worth nothing that Trainor never said the election was "unconstitutional," as reported by RecentlyHeard.com.

All 3 claims have inaccuracies
There are inaccuracies in all three of his claims, most of which echoed the baseless claims that other Republicans, including Trump, have stated since Nov. 3.
Multiple fact-checks, including by the New York Times and PolitiFact, found no evidence to support claims that observers were blocked from ballot counting rooms, including in Pennsylvania, which Trainor highlighted in his remarks.
Some legal filings from the Trump campaign itself acknowledged that its observers were present in the rooms where ballots were counted.
There is also no evidence that there was any systemic fraud in the election.
Last week, a national coalition of election security officials also described the election as "the most secure in American history," per USA TODAY. There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised," the coalition concluded.
Two weeks after the election, the Washington Post also concluded that on top of there being no widespread fraud, "there is barely evidence of even minor fraudulent incidents."
The New York Times also contacted the offices of the top election officials in every state to ask if they suspected or had evidence of voter fraud; none reported any major issues.
The claim that "every instance" of states that were too close to call on Nov. 6 were states run by Democrats is also untrue.
On Nov. 6, six states — Arizona, Alaska, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania — were still too close to call, per CNN.
Secretaries of state are tasked with election administration in many states. Both Georgia and Nevada have Republican secretaries of state. Alaska has no secretary of state, so its election duties fall to the lieutenant governor, who is also a Republican.
What have the other commissioners said about the election?
There are supposed to be six commissioners of the FEC at any given time, and the body requires at least four commissioners for a quorum. But due to a spate of resignations and a dearth of appointments, there are currently only three commissioners, including Trainor, the chair.
After being impotent since September 2019, it had quorum for only 28 days after Trainor took up his post in June before another commissioner resigned and left it powerless once more, per the New York Times.
The remaining commissioners are Steven T. Walther, an independent, and Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democrat.
Walther, who is the vice chair, has been on the FEC since 2006. He has not spoken about the election since it occurred. Weintraub has done three yearlong stints as its chair since she joined the FEC in 2002.
She has defended the integrity of the election and said the opposite of Trainor.
"State and local officials and poll workers throughout the country really stepped up. And there have been very few complaints about how this election was run. Very few substantiated complaints, let me put it that way," Weintraub told CNN.
"There is no evidence of any kind of voter fraud," she added. "There is no evidence of illegal votes being cast."
Weintraub also retweeted a take-down of Trainor by Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California-Irvine.
"The FEC deals with campaign finance, not vote counting. And Trey Trainor does not speak for the FEC," Hasan wrote on Twitter.
Along with her retweet, Weintraub added, "I can confirm: FEC does *not* say widespread fraud."
Our ruling: Partly false
The quotes from FEC Chair Trey Trainor are real and came from an interview with Newsmax. But he's not the "top boss of all the election officials," and the FEC's jurisdiction isn't related to vote counting or election security — only campaign finances. Trainor himself admitted he wasn't briefed on the issue, and all of his comments contained factual inaccuracies, echoing false allegations of election fraud that have been presented with no proof. Based on our research these claims are PARTLY FALSE, true only in that Trainor expressed his opinion about the election.

These Items in Your Home Are Harming America’s Sea Animals

How severely the world’s plastic waste crisis is affecting marine wildlife is not fully understood, despite decades of research and gruesome images of whales’ bellies filled with plastic and a turtle with a straw lodged in its nostril. A new report by Oceana, a conservation group, illustrates some of what we know about how plastic affects sea turtles and marine mammals in U.S. waters.
The findings offer a glimpse of a larger problem.
The authors focused on sea turtles and marine mammals for practical reasons. These animals are federally protected, so when they are found in distress or wash up dead on a beach, responders are required to document it. By collecting data from government agencies and marine life organizations around the country, the authors found almost 1,800 cases of plastic entanglement or ingestion affecting 40 species since 2009.
But the report notes that the number is “a gross underestimate” because humans observe a tiny fraction of animal deaths in the ocean. Even so, of the nation’s 23 coastal states, it found cases in 21.
“This is the first time we’re looking at the problem from a U.S. perspective,” said Kimberly Warner, the report’s author and a senior scientist at Oceana. “This brings the problem home.”
In 2016, the United States produced more plastic waste than any other nation, and more of that plastic entered the ocean than previously thought, according to a recent study. As of 2015, less than a tenth of the world’s cumulative plastic waste had been recycled.
The Oceana report found that in the reported cases, 90% of the animals had swallowed plastic, and the rest were entangled in it. Necropsies often showed that the animals had died from blockages or lacerations. Other times, ingesting plastic may have simply weakened the animal or played no role in its death. Overall, in 82% of the cases, the animals died.
The culprits go beyond the usual suspects.
In the 1980s, environmental activists warned of the devastating effects of six-pack rings ensnaring sea animals. People started dutifully cutting them before disposal, and in 1994 the Environmental Protection Agency mandated that six-pack rings must be degradable, though the process may take months. Consumers have also been warned about releasing balloons, which can harm marine animals.
Recently some municipalities, counties and states have banned single-use plastic bags, one of the biggest contributors to ingestion and entanglements, according to the report. Plastic packing straps were found constricting the necks or bodies of seals and sea lions, naturally curious animals who may have gotten entangled while trying to play. Manatees ingested lots of fishing line.
But the report also found many more surprising items caused harm. Along the Gulf Coast, mesh produce bags were found in the guts of sea turtles and also entangling their bodies. In 2015, a loggerhead turtle in Georgia was found with a toothbrush and fork in its digestive tract, among other items. Two years later, another turtle was found in New York with a plastic dental flosser inside it. Food wrappers, sandwich bags, sponges, and even decorative plastic Easter grass were among the items discovered. A bottlenose dolphin in North Carolina had its head stuck in the hole of a flying disc. In Virginia, a DVD case lacerated the stomach of a sei whale.
Many of the victims are endangered or threatened.
More than a dozen species at risk of extinction — including sea turtles, Hawaiian monk seals and sei whales — ingested or were tangled in plastic. Manatees, those gentle, slow-moving giants that graze on seagrass, made up 700 cases. The report quotes Brandon Bassett, a biologist at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, describing part of what he found inside one dead manatee: “Imagine a ball of plastic bags in the stomach, about the size of a cantaloupe, and then a bunch of plastic bags that were wrapped and almost like a rope that was about 3 feet long.”
Scientists are learning more about why animals consume plastic. To sea turtles, a floating plastic bag may resemble a jellyfish meal, but that doesn’t explain the bottle caps and hard plastic shards found in their digestive tracts or stool. One study suggested that plastic starts to smell appetizing as it becomes coated in algae and microorganisms.
In South Carolina, one ailing loggerhead passed almost 60 pieces of plastic through its digestive system during its rehabilitation at a sea turtle center. Juveniles are more at risk because of their size and undeveloped gastrointestinal tract. More than 20% of the sea turtles that had ingested plastic were just months old. Some were only a few days old. A recent Australian study found that just 14 pieces of plastic in their digestive tracts significantly increased sea turtles’ risk of death.
Still, plastic waste is not the biggest killer of marine life.
Humans have created all kinds of dire problems for sea animals: rising sea temperatures, fishermen hauling in unintended species, ships striking them, other marine pollution and habitat degradation.
“Plastic in and of itself may not be as big of a threat as we’re led to believe,” said Jesse Senko, an assistant research professor and senior sustainability scientist at Arizona State University. “The scientific community has not done a good enough job of really assessing these questions, looking beyond how it affects an individual animal.”
He believes that images of decomposing sea birds with bellies full of plastic lead the public and media to focus on plastic even when other threats are more significant.
Ultimately, plastics and rising sea temperatures are connected; after all, the vast majority of plastic is derived from fossil fuels.
The Oceana report calls on national, state and local governments to restrict the production of single-use plastics and it asks companies to offer consumers plastic-free options.
“I’m old enough to remember a time when it didn’t permeate everything in my life,” Warner said. “And yet it’s built up at an alarming rate.”

The last time Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn headlined a movie together, the Berlin Wall was intact and the rescue of Baby Jessica dominated the news.
It would take more than 30 years after their 1987 comedy “Overboard” for the pair to team up on screen again: tentatively, at first, with Hawn’s brief cameo in Russell’s 2018 Netflix family holiday film, “The Christmas Chronicles,” and now in delightful full force for the Chris Columbus-helmed sequel, “The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two” (Netflix, Nov. 25). This time around, Hawn’s Mrs. Claus is a central figure opposite Russell — embodying, as she puts it, “an up-to-date Santa, who’s kind of sexy” — as they help two kids thwart a troublemaker’s North Pole schemes.
Portraying Yuletide royalty suits the real-life couple of 37 years. After meeting on a film set in 1966, they eventually began dating in 1983 while shooting “Swing Shift” and quickly formed something of an A-list Brady Bunch. Never married, they raised actors Kate and Oliver Hudson — Hawn’s children from her marriage to Bill Hudson — who lovingly refer to Russell as “Pa.” The couple also have a son together, actor Wyatt Russell. (Kurt has another son, Boston Russell, from a previous marriage.)
More recently, Hawn, who turns 75 on Nov. 21, and Russell, 69, have been leaning on each other during the pandemic, taking masked strolls around Los Angeles and filming energetic at-home Instagram videos — highlights include Russell tickling Hawn during a “laughing challenge” and Hawn shimmying to Outkast’s “Hey Ya” in the kitchen. “I like to dance with Goldie every once in a while, but I can’t tell you how little I care about social media,” Russell said.
For our October video chat, the two were perched on the patio of their Pacific Palisades home. Russell’s transitional lenses darkened in the afternoon sun; Hawn occasionally paused to make kissing noises at a pet dog running astray or to rub Russell’s back in a bid to get him to change the subject. They could be the grandparents next door, if the grandparents next door also happened to have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
The couple spoke about “The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,” the state of Hollywood and why they think celebrities shouldn’t always air their opinions. Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.
Q: This is the first time you’ve co-starred together since “Overboard.” What took so long?
HAWN: Material! Really, it’s about the material, and it just didn’t come along.
RUSSELL: I thought we’d work together much sooner than this, but Goldie and I are pretty choosy. And generally, Goldie Hawn movies and movies that Kurt Russell is in are pretty different things.
HAWN: True.
RUSSELL: It’s not mandatory just because you live with someone, you love someone and you enjoy working together that you should do 10 or 15 movies together.
Q: Chris Columbus has said that he wanted Kurt to be a sort of “superhero Santa.” Goldie, did you have any notes around what direction to take Mrs. Claus?
HAWN : To be honest, I didn’t quite know. My instinct was that she was very benevolent, very kind, and Chris gave her a little bit more gravitas. It wasn’t as pixie-esque as I may have seen her.
RUSSELL : In the first movie, Mrs. Claus became like Columbo’s wife. What’s fun about it is that she’s a mysterious character. She’s not just a sweet old lady who bakes cookies.
Q: She’s only referred to as “Mrs. Claus” in both films. Does she have a first name?
RUSSELL : She does have a first name, and we will never know it for a reason.
HAWN : And that reason is in [Kurt’s] mind. [Laughter]
Q: Santa and Mrs. Claus communicate with the elves by speaking Yulish, an elfish language created specifically for these films. Was that a challenge?
RUSSELL : There’s a guy who writes it out phonetically and then you read it. We have no idea what we’re saying!
HAWN : He says it’s a language, but in my mind it’s just sounds.
RUSSELL : It’s not to be taken lightly. I’ll never forget when I saw “The Passion of the Christ” and went, “Mel discovered something that nobody figured out for all this time we’ve been making movies.” If you do anything that’s historical, especially the Bible, and you do it in an original language, it gives it a sense of authenticity. And when I saw that, and I read this script, I thought, elfish will give this a sense of authenticity.
Q: What’s the dynamic like now when you work together? Did you go full method as Mr. and Mrs. Claus?
HAWN : I left Mrs. Claus in her outfit. I hung it up on a hanger, and we went and had a cocktail and ate mushroom soup and that’s pretty much it. [Laughter]
RUSSELL : We’re pretty old school. We do what we do at work, and then when you come home it’s not ruling your life.
HAWN : The really fun part was that it was just the two of us in the makeup trailer. We were always right next to each other. And your makeup guy always had candy.
Q: Christmas at the Hawn-Russell home seems like a big deal in real life, too.
HAWN : I just can’t even tell you; it’s more than Christmas. This year, we’re going to be here, but normally we’re in Aspen. It’s a fantasy: the snow and the kids and all the stockings hanging from the fireplace. And Kurt in his Santa suit —
RUSSELL : I’m very careful about what I say about this because we have grandkids who will see this stuff.
HAWN : Oh, that’s right. Well, they’re not going to be reading The New York Times. [Laughter]
RUSSELL : Right, right. After we have Christmas Eve dinner we always have somebody read “The Night Before Christmas,” and then we track Santa’s movements on the app. Right after that, you start getting things in shape because at any point he can show up.
Q: Goldie, you were raised Jewish. Do you still keep any Hanukkah traditions?
HAWN : Growing up, we’d light candles for Hanukkah, but I think my mother stopped lighting them because I was on the phone once, and I backed up to the Hanukkah candles. You know the wall phones back in the day? I had wrapped myself in the cord, and I caught on fire. I literally burned my robe and my back. It’s like, Baruch atah ... My mom came, and they unraveled me and, thank God, I’m fine.
Q: Is the plan to keep reteaming on more “Christmas Chronicles” films?
RUSSELL : We have no idea what Netflix wants to do there. I’ve never been big on sequels, but that was 50, 40, 30 years ago. Now sequels aren’t even sequels anymore. We’ve just cyclically found our way around to making television. You go to the movies and you’re seeing television because there’s a serial aspect to it.
HAWN : It’s like Marvel.
Q: You’ve seen the industry go through a lot of changes. What are your thoughts on the state of Hollywood in 2020?
HAWN : We’re all trying to figure out what to do. I mean, when you look at how AMC has only so much money to exist before it goes away. When you see that big screen and people are in there engaging, there’s nothing like it. It makes me very melancholy to know that that could be over.
However, there’s more content now than ever, and not only that, there’s a place for content. We’re looking at incredible talent. Like “Succession,” the acting is amazing. But the one thing I wonder about all of that is will there be any movie stars? That thing of the old days when there were these glamorous movie stars and people that you just couldn’t wait to go see. I don’t know if that will happen again. What do you think?
RUSSELL : I think the question is will there be an arena for that? Without the arena, those movie stars don’t happen. That cultural aspect doesn’t happen.
Q: Speaking of an arena, Kurt, you’ve said in the past that celebrities shouldn’t really weigh in on politics. Do you still feel that way?
RUSSELL : Totally. I’ve always been someone who felt we are court jesters. That’s what we do. As far as I’m concerned, you should step away from saying anything so that you can still be seen by the audience in any character. There’s no reason entertainers can’t learn just as much as anybody else about a subject, whatever it is. But I think that what’s sad about it is that they lose their status as a court jester. And I’m a court jester. That’s what I was born to do.
HAWN : You’re not always funny.
RUSSELL : A court jester isn’t always funny. A court jester is the only one who can walk into the castle and put the king down as long as he doesn’t hit too close to home. I think that’s been a big, important part of all cultures throughout history, and I’d like to see it stay in ours.
HAWN : But we did have a president who was an actor, Ronald Reagan.
RUSSELL : Like I said, actors can learn as much as anybody else can.
HAWN : Well, I’m just saying Reagan definitely was a well-known actor. I think it’s a personal choice whether you want to get into that. The one thing I don’t agree with is that just because we have a platform we always have to use it. That is our choice.
Q: What’s left on your career bucket list?
HAWN : I really don’t have anything that I’m dying to do. I want to live a happy life, and I have that. I want to be able to go places, but right now, we can’t do that. If a movie comes along and it’s great, that could be fun. Other than that, I want to be with the grandkids.
RUSSELL : It’s still fun to act. I don’t know why that is. By now, it shouldn’t be.
HAWN : I think there’s a reality here, and the reality is not so much for Kurt or for certain kinds of men who do certain kinds of movies. But for people that had careers such as mine, you have to get real. There is a finite amount of time that you get to do what you want to do.
RUSSELL : I’m honestly more interested in the kids’ careers than what’s going on in mine.
HAWN : Oliver is doing a pilot for a series, and maybe also my grandson. So if it works out, I said, “Is there a mother who comes around every now and then? Anybody want to hire me as Oliver’s mother and Bodhi’s grandmother?” So, I’m just looking for the fun and not the career. I’m so grateful to have had the career that I have.
RUSSELL : You’ve had a pretty good one.
Q: It sounds like your grandkids will continue the acting tradition, too.
HAWN : There is no doubt about it. It’s pretty amazing how those genes just keep moving on.
RUSSELL : There’s only a few families in history that have as many people in it that are at the level that our family is. It’s not something we promote. It’s just something that if it comes to them and they want to do, then they do it.
Q: You’ve both talked about not getting caught up in the industry, despite your successes. How has that approach shaped your lives?
HAWN : In terms of our family, we tried to not work at the same time. But sometimes we were gone. [In the 1990s] Kurt was gone for five months during “Backdraft,” so everybody missed Kurt. I was gone almost six months when I was doing “Everyone Says I Love You” and “The First Wives Club.”
RUSSELL : We did the best we could, and I think our kids benefited from the good decisions, and they obviously didn’t benefit from the decisions that were either bad or didn’t turn out. It’s life.
HAWN : I mean, you’ve got to have something to go to a psychiatrist about. [Laughter]

Will Lara Trump Be the Next Trump on a Ballot?

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law who emerged during the 2020 presidential campaign as a defender of President Donald Trump’s basest political instincts, is now eyeing a political future of her own in her home state of North Carolina.
As Donald Trump attempts to subvert the election to remain in power, Lara Trump, three allies said, has been telling associates she is considering a run for Senate in 2022, in what is expected to be a competitive race for the first open Senate seat in a very swingy swing state in a generation. Sen. Richard Burr, an unobtrusive Republican legislator who was thrust into the spotlight as chair of a committee investigating the president’s ties to Russia, has said he will retire at the end of his term. Despite expanded turnout in rural areas, Donald Trump won North Carolina by a smaller margin than he did four years ago, just 1.3 percentage points, a sign that overall the state is trending blue and that the race for the Senate seat will be tightly contested by both parties in the first post-Donald Trump election.
But not, perhaps, an entirely post-Trump election, if Lara Trump proceeds.
Lara Trump, 38, a former personal trainer and television producer for Inside Edition, wed Eric Trump at the family’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Plam Beach, Florida, in 2014 and worked as a senior adviser on the 2020 Trump campaign. Now, the daughter-in-law whom Donald Trump had often joked to donors that he “couldn’t pick out of a lineup” is floating herself as the first test of the enduring power of the Trump name.
“She’s very charismatic, she understands retail politics well, and has a natural instinct for politics,” said Mercedes Schlapp, a Trump campaign adviser who traveled the country as a surrogate alongside Lara Trump. “In North Carolina, in particular, she’s a household name and people know her. She worked really hard on the campaign and was very involved in a lot of decisions throughout.”
Lara Trump declined to comment about her plans.
Much of the speculation about who might inherit the Trump mantle has focused on his eldest children, who have cultivated their own niche followings. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, has the deepest connection with the online disinformation system that has fueled support for his father as well as with the Trump base that supports protecting the Second Amendment.
Ivanka Trump, the president’s eldest daughter and a White House official who focused on workforce development, was deployed on the campaign trail to make the president more palatable to suburban women who were turned off by his tone and his tweets. She generally steered clear of repeating her father’s ad hominem attacks on President-elect Joe Biden, or his son Hunter, or casting doubt on the integrity of the election.
But Ivanka Trump, people familiar with her plans said, is still deciding on whether to settle her family in New Jersey or Florida and has no immediate intention to pursue elected office herself. Donald Trump Jr., meanwhile, despite his talent for channeling his father’s id, may choose to forgo a run for office all together.
Eric Trump, the most low profile of the Trump siblings, has never cultivated a political spotlight, leaving the way clear for his wife.
Eric and Lara Trump currently live in Westchester, New York, with their two young children (their daughter, Carolina, is named after the state Lara Trump is now eyeing). It’s not apparent that simply having the family backing would empty, or even diminish, the field in what is expected to be one of the most targeted seats in the nation where Republican candidates with experience in the state are already lining up.
There’s Rep. Mark Walker, a Trump ally whom the president has encouraged to run for Burr’s seat, and indicated he would support. There’s Pat McCrory, the former governor, who has said he is eyeing the seat. Tim Moore, the North Carolina speaker of the House, is said to be in the mix. And Dan Forest, who just lost a race for governor against the Democratic incumbent, Roy Cooper, is expected to be in the field.
And then there is another contender from the president’s inner circle, at least as it stands at the moment: Mark Meadows, the former North Carolina representative and White House chief of staff, is widely expected to move back home and run for the seat as well. Aides to Meadows declined to comment about his political future.
None of those more experienced candidates have the name recognition and the ability to raise big online cash that the president’s daughter-in-law, who has been cultivating her own profile with a campaign YouTube show and events across the country, has. “She would be formidable,” said Kellyanne Conway, a former White House official and the 2016 Trump campaign manager. “She has the trifecta: She can raise money, raise awareness of key issues and raise attention to her race. Unlike many typical politicians, she connects with people and is a compelling messenger.”
Michael Watley, chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, predicted that the race would draw significant interest from a wide range of people.
“I think you’re going to need a dance card to keep everything straight,” he said.
Put more bluntly, Morgan Jackson, a Democratic strategist based in North Carolina said, “There are a lot of people ahead of Lara Trump in line. Given how rare it is that there’s an open seat, I don’t believe any of the folks who actually live in North Carolina and have been here will get out of the way for someone else.”
Lara Trump, who spoke at the Republican National Convention, made many campaign stops in North Carolina this year. On the trail, she has been willing to go where surrogates like Ivanka Trump, seeking to soften the president, have not. Speaking on behalf of her father-in-law in her hometown of Wilmington, North Carolina, she echoed the president’s baseless attempts to undermine confidence in the election results. She said the system was “ripe with fraud,” and claimed that universal vote by mail “is not a good system, it’s never been tested.”
On CNN in October, she accused Biden of suffering from a severe “cognitive decline” and batted away questions about Donald Trump encouraging violence on Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who the FBI had recently said had been targeted by a kidnapping plot. Lara Trump chalked up her father-in-law’s behavior as an example of someone simply “having fun at a Trump rally.”
Since Election Day, she has actively elevated conspiracy theories online about election-equipment maker Dominion Voting Systems Inc., which the president has claimed, with no evidence, switched Trump votes to Biden’s column.
A former Trump aide, Omarosa Manigault Newman, claimed in a 2018 memoir that Lara Trump had offered her a $15,000-a-month contract in exchange for silence about her time in the White House, and subsequently released a secret recording that Manigault Newman said supported that claim.
While the idea of another Trump testing the political waters was anathema to Republicans who wanted the party to move away from its current Trumpian identity, others have been trying to lure the next generation in.
The Club for Growth, an influential conservative anti-tax group, earlier this year commissioned a poll with Lara Trump as a candidate for Congress representing New York’s 2nd District.
David McIntosh, the president of Club for Growth, said at the time that the group simply polled her name to show there was a well of support and lure her into an open race.
In a hypothetical primary, the poll showed her winning by 30 points.

In a blow to the Trump administration’s efforts to strip unauthorized immigrants from census totals used for reapportionment, Census Bureau officials have concluded that they cannot produce the state population totals required to reallocate seats in the House of Representatives until after President Donald Trump leaves office in January.
The president said in July that he planned to remove unauthorized immigrants from the count for the first time, leaving an older and whiter population as the basis for divvying up House seats, a shift that would be likely to increase the number of House seats held by Republicans over the next decade.
But Wednesday, according to three bureau officials, the Census Bureau told the Commerce Department that a growing number of snags in the massive data-processing operation that generates population totals had delayed the completion of population calculations at least until Jan. 26, and perhaps to mid-February. Those officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from the Trump administration.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the bureau, was informed of the holdup Wednesday evening, those people and others said. The Commerce Department and the Census Bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The director of the Census Bureau, Steven Dillingham, acknowledged a delay in a statement issued Thursday but did not explicitly rule out delivering reapportionment totals before Trump’s term ends.
“During post-collection processing, certain processing anomalies have been discovered,” the statement said. “These types of processing anomalies have occurred in past censuses. I am directing the Census Bureau to utilize all resources available to resolve this as expeditiously as possible. As it has been all along, our goal remains an accurate and statistically sound census.”
It’s not clear whether Dillingham’s directive will force the bureau to overcome the obstacles the processing delays pose to Trump’s plan to upend the centuries-old formula for allotting seats in the House.
Under law, the White House must send a state-by-state census tally to the House of Representatives next year which will be used to reallocate House seats among the states. On Trump’s order, the Census Bureau is attempting to compile a separate state-by-state tally of unauthorized immigrants so that their numbers can be subtracted from official census results before they are dispatched to the House.
That cannot happen — and Trump’s plan will become moot — if the census totals are not completed before Trump leaves office Jan. 20.
It is possible that the administration could still order the bureau to produce the state-by-state population data before the president’s term ends, regardless of data processing problems that affect its accuracy. But experts on census issues said it was unclear whether the bureau’s career staff — data scientists and other experts who have devoted their careers to an accurate head count — would carry out such an order or instead resign en masse.
If the Trump administration nonetheless produces a state-by-state count that the bureau refuses to stand behind after the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, the agency’s repudiation of such a count, and the methodology that produced it, would likely become an important factor in the ongoing litigation over the Trump administration’s plan.
“If you do it in an inaccurate way,” said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, “you get even farther from what the framers intended, which was a single,` objective mathematical count of the population that’s indisputable, and that provides a basis for representation in the House that’s resistant to political manipulation.”
The Supreme Court is set this month to consider claims that Trump’s order violates the Constitution’s mandate that “the whole number of persons” in each state be used to allocate House seats. Ho argued that case before a three-judge panel in New York and in September won a unanimous ruling that Trump’s order exceeded his authority under federal laws governing the census and reapportionment.
Two other federal courts in California and Maryland have similarly ruled that it is unconstitutional and contrary to federal law to remove undocumented immigrants from the apportionment count.
The ramifications of the president’s order extend well beyond the House. Excluding unauthorized immigrants from population totals could drastically alter the allotment of federal dollars for a broad range of services, generally shifting grants and government resources from cities to less populated areas.
Trump’s July order sowed chaos in a decennial head count that already had been wracked by the coronavirus pandemic, which had all but ground the count to a halt. In April, with many operations stalled, the bureau asked Congress to extend the deadline for delivering reapportionment totals from the statutory Dec. 31 deadline to April 2021.
But in July, Trump abruptly reversed course, ordering that the Dec. 31 deadline be met. That forced Census Bureau experts to compress five months of data processing into 2 1/2 months.
In depositions this fall in a California lawsuit, Census Bureau officials said the agency could meet the new schedule only if it could avoid the software and data glitches that were common to previous censuses. The delays disclosed on Wednesday, officials said, only drove home how difficult that had been.
“Nobody should read anything nefarious about these anomalies or the problems they are causing,” one census official said. “These are typical processing anomalies that happen with every census. We tried our best to crunch the schedule, and we knew something like this might happen. And it did.”
The White House seeded the top ranks of the Census Bureau with political appointees this summer and fall, apparently to ensure that Trump’s reapportionment strategy would be carried out. In recent weeks, those appointees have become increasingly insistent that both the estimate of unauthorized immigrants and the actual census be rushed to completion, according to people both inside and outside the bureau.
The census has traditionally been prized for the precision and accuracy of the data it produces. Terri Ann Lowenthal, a consultant on census issues to an array of businesses, governments and nonprofits pressing for an accurate count, called reports of political pressure on the count disturbing.
“The bureau’s reported inability to finish the compiling the apportionment numbers while President Trump is still in office could be leading to some political pressure which could affect the accuracy of the final numbers,” she said. “And that would be very unfortunate.”

Giuliani Makes Fraud Accusations That the Trump Team Has Failed to Support in Court

At a rambling news conference Thursday, Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, mixed misleading statements, wild conspiracy theories and outright fabrications as he attempted to suggest that Trump still had a viable pathway to winning the election.
Over and over again, Giuliani and other members of the president’s legal team suggested that Trump had evidence to prove that “massive fraud” had been committed in swing states across the country. But Giuliani himself had undercut that accusation in one high-profile case, telling the federal judge overseeing a suit in Pennsylvania, “This is not a fraud case.”
Giuliani, speaking at the Republican National Committee’s headquarters in Washington, claimed that Trump would prevail in the election if only he could get his day in front of a judge.
“Give us a chance to prove it in court and we will,” he said.
The problem? In many of the instances that Giuliani mentioned, the Trump campaign has already had its chance in court — and failed.
For example, Giuliani quoted a Detroit poll worker named Jessy Jacob, who submitted an affidavit in the case of Costantino v. City of Detroit. Jacob claimed that she had witnessed poll workers in Detroit, a heavily Democratic city, encouraging voters to cast their ballots for Joe Biden, and that while she was working at “a satellite location” she was instructed by her superiors not to ask for voters’ identification.
On Friday, however, that case was dismissed by a Michigan circuit judge, Timothy M. Kenny, who said that several of the charges it contained were “rife with speculation and guesswork.” Kenny specifically addressed Jacob’s accusations, saying they were “generalized” and asserted “behavior with no date, location, frequency or names of employees.”
Giuliani also cited an affidavit in the case from Melissa Carone, a contractor for Dominion Voting Systems, to claim that trucks intended to transport food instead brought “thousands and thousands of ballots” to Detroit. But Kenny had also rejected that story, saying that Carone’s description of the events at a vote counting center in Detroit “does not square with any of the other affidavits” and that her “allegations simply are not credible.”
In referring to other cases brought by the Trump campaign, Giuliani made even vaguer accusations and provided no evidence to support them. He claimed that he had more than 100 affidavits alleging voting improprieties in a federal lawsuit the campaign filed in Michigan, Donald J. Trump for President Inc. v. Benson. But the campaign’s own lawyers voluntarily dismissed that suit just hours before Giuliani held his news conference.
Giuliani further said that the Trump campaign had affidavits proving that nearly 700,000 mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania had been tainted. But no such affidavits have been filed in the campaign’s federal lawsuit in Pennsylvania that is seeking to halt the certification of the vote there. Moreover, Giuliani never mentioned the affidavits when he personally appeared at a hearing in the case Tuesday afternoon.
Giuliani also claimed that Biden admitted a few days before the election to “have the best voter fraud team in the world.” This was a reference to a deceptively edited video that spread on social media. In his original remarks, Biden was referring to efforts to protect against voter fraud.
Sidney Powell, another lawyer for Trump, baselessly warned of “massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China and the interference with our elections here in the United States.” She claimed that tabulating software used by Dominion and Smartmatic, two voting machine companies, was “created by Hugo Chávez.”
Powell cited a partially redacted affidavit from an unnamed former military official in Venezuela that accused Smartmatic of helping to rig that country’s elections. But Smartmatic did not provide technology to any battleground state in this year’s U.S. presidential election, nor has it sold any software or hardware to Dominion, which is a competitor. Electronic voting security experts told The New York Times that the affidavit contained no evidence of a rigged election in the United States.
Software made by Dominion was used to count votes in several swing states, and the company has been a target of misinformation from Trump’s allies, but there is no evidence that the software improperly changed any vote tallies.
Powell also wrongly claimed that a British baron named Mark Malloch-Brown was one of the “leaders of the Dominion project” as well as billionaire George Soros’ “No. 2 person” in the United Kingdom. Malloch-Brown is Smartmatic’s chairman and sits on the board of Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Soros has been the target of numerous conspiracy theories propagated on the right, some of them with anti-Semitic overtones.
The Trump campaign has not yet included allegations about Dominion machines in any of its more than 30 lawsuits where the accusations would have to be proved in front of a judge.
Shortly after Giuliani’s news conference, which was carried live on Fox News, Republican strategist Karl Rove appeared on the channel and said that Giuliani should prove his “strange” accusations in court or “withdraw” them immediately.

WASHINGTON GOP LAWMAKERS DECRY INSLEE'S RESTRICTIONS McMorris Rodgers among unhappy House members; meanwhile, coronavirus cases keep climbing statewide

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - After Washington's new statewide restrictions on businesses and gatherings went into effect Tuesday and Wednesday, the three Republicans who represent the state in Congress criticized Gov. Jay Inslee's move and called for more local control to keep businesses open.
After Inslee, a Democrat re-elected to his third term this month, announced the restrictions Sunday in response to a rising tide of COVID-19 cases across the state and nation, Eastern Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers released a statement warning the month-long emergency measures will hurt small businesses.
"I would really encourage the governor to focus on giving people hope rather than continuing to create so much fear," the Spokane Republican said in an interview. "We need to focus on doing things in a safe and responsible way. To close restaurants and bars and reduce the retail as dramatically as he's mandating is ignoring all of the work and the investment that they have done to open in a safe and responsible way."
The restrictions on bars and restaurants went into effect Wednesday, while rules for other businesses kicked in a day earlier. All the measures - which include the closure of gyms and movie theaters and limits on weddings, religious services and other gatherings - are set to last at least until Dec. 14.
Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Central Washington Republican who announced his own COVID-19 diagnosis Wednesday, said Tuesday that restaurants "are not the culprits in this situation" and should be allowed to stay open for indoor dining.
"I don't think that the numbers are telling us that restaurants are where people are contracting the disease," Newhouse said. "If the true goal is to prevent people from gathering, we're actually forcing them - by taking away those options - into getting together in private homes."
A Nov. 12 report from the Washington State Department of Health shows that 151 coronavirus outbreaks have taken place in restaurants in the state, more than in any other non-health care setting.
Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, who represents southwest Washington, echoed her fellow Republicans in a statement.
"These are state and local decisions based on local conditions, but we have learned enough about how to prevent the spread of the virus that we ought to be able to avoid shutting down businesses as long as they take the necessary precautions," she said. "As we head into the holiday season, massive layoffs and furloughs are going to be particularly devastating and we need to make sure workers can still buy food and pay bills."
Congress passed a nearly $3 trillion pandemic relief package in March, but that funding is drying up with many of the legislation's provisions set to expire at the end of December. Republican and Democratic negotiators have been deadlocked for months over a new relief deal and it is unclear if more help is on the way from the Capitol.
Herrera Beutler filed a motion in September to circumvent the House's top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi of California, and force a vote on a standalone bill to extend one critical measure, the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans that kept many businesses afloat until it expired in August.
"The PPP is a proven safety net program that has saved thousands of jobs in Southwest Washington and millions across the country," she said in a statement. "The need to immediately revive the Paycheck Protection Program's forgivable small business loans was already urgent; with Governor Inslee's announcement it's become an emergency."
The GOP lawmakers' reactions to Inslee's order reflected the ongoing polarization that public health experts have warned hampers efforts to combat the virus.
"We've got to get public health issues out of the realm of political divisiveness," Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, said Tuesday in a New York Times virtual event. "We've got to do everything we possibly can to pull together as a nation and not as individual factions having differences that spill over into public health."
Even wearing a mask has become divisive in Congress, although McMorris Rodgers and New-
house both said they wear masks in public. In a tense moment on the Senate floor Monday, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, asked Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan to wear a mask, to which Sullivan shot back, "I don't need your instruction."
Marjorie Taylor Greene, an incoming GOP congresswoman from Georgia, tweeted after a Nov. 13 orientation for new lawmakers, "masks are oppressive," followed by the hashtag "#FreeYourFace."
Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, said politicizing basic public health measures has a serious impact.
"The scientists are telling us, 'If you wear a mask, you keep this pandemic from spreading,' " she said. "It's pretty simple, and it is the cheapest thing we can be doing, so to have a division about it being political is really disappointing."
McMorris Rodgers said Washington's most rural counties shouldn't have to follow the same restrictions as counties that include cities like Seattle.
"People are exhausted and running on empty, and to be imposing a one-size-fits-all mandate across the state and not recognizing regional differences is impacting real business owners who employ real people that are going to lose their jobs. Ferry County is not the same as King County."
Ferry County has seen just 45 confirmed cases and a single death, but other counties in the mostly rural 5th Congressional District McMorris Rodgers represents have been less fortunate. Spokane, Whitman, Garfield, Asotin and Walla Walla counties all have higher per-capita infection rates than any county west of the Cascades, according to a New York Times tracker.
The Central Washington district Newhouse represents has seen the highest infection rates in the state. One in 16 Franklin County residents has contracted the virus, as have one in 17 in Adams County and one in 18 in Yakima County.
Murray said a county-by-county approach would fail to account for the way the virus spreads across county and state boundaries.
"People are very mobile," she said. "They go from city to city, they go from community to community, they go from state to state. And as long as they're doing that without taking precautions to stop the spread, it's going to continue to grow. And it is a costly pandemic that's impacting all of us."

Texto completo: In this strange and disquieting year, Thanksgiving planning begins with the question of whether to have any sort of gathering at all. Which wines to drink with the meal will be the least of your worries.
That's as it should be. Selecting wines may cause a mild quiver of anxiety, but it's never really a problem.
Even in the best of times, when you're embracing aunts, third cousins and your best friend's sister's daughter, the joy of the feast and the renewal of ties go a long way toward mitigating the quality of whatever happens to be in your glass.
Still, good wine can be a significant asset. It can compel guests to take notice, to pause and ponder rather than gulp and disregard. If bottles are to be opened, why not select them with the same diligence you apply to choosing the perfect recipe for mashed potatoes?
Thanksgiving comes as COVID-19 cases are spiking nationwide. Every family will decide how to approach this often joyously rambunctious holiday. Many gatherings will be diminished as people, protecting their loved ones and themselves, decide not to travel or entertain. Thanksgivings for four, or two or even one will not be unusual.
Somehow, families will manage to bridge the distance. Whether through Zoom or the phone, people will find a way to share their blessings, maybe through a prayer or a toast. Wine can help forge these links, possibly by opening the same bottles from afar.
Our wine panel was not immune to the 2020 winnowing. Typically, we assemble monthly in a room at The New York Times building, where we consider and discuss a range of bottles. In deference to the pandemic, we have not gathered since February.
Still, we did not want to let Thanksgiving pass, so we got together outdoors, in the rooftop space of the NoMad restaurant in Manhattan. Even so, we were not entirely whole. Bernard Kirsch, our tasting coordinator, always joins us, but this year he opted out. Our colleague Pete Wells, like so many parents dealing with home-schooling, faced a last-minute child-care issue and could not attend.
That left Florence Fabricant, Julia Moskin and me, so we invited Thomas Pastuszak, NoMad's wine director, to contribute a couple of bottles. We would be tasting eight wines in all.
We stuck with our usual ground rules: Each of us would bring two wines, one white and one red. None would retail for more than $25. We adopted these guidelines years ago, believing that for big gatherings, nobody wants to spend a lot of money on wine.
Smaller gatherings offer different opportunities. You don't need as much wine, so if you like you can open your finest bottles.
Dinner for four, for example could begin with hors d'oeuvres and sparkling wine.
It could be Champagne. But if you want to emphasize American wines, I have found wonderful choices from the West Coast: Blue Ox, Cruse, Schramsberg, Iron Horse, Soter and Under the Wire are a few names worth knowing about.
Follow that with a good white wine, whatever strikes your fancy. Chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, riesling, all will be great, but don't stop there. You might like an assyrtiko, or maybe a carricante. Maybe you're beginning with a creamy soup? Any of these wines will work, as long as they are not too oaky.
I would follow up with a red - a pinot noir or syrah, or maybe a Barolo or a Beaujolais. Whether serving turkey, or downsizing to a duck or chicken, these are all flexible with wine, so match the bottle to your sense of the occasion rather than with the food.
Maybe you would prefer two whites, or no whites at all. Why not? This is the year to eliminate rigid constraints.
Even so, the wine panel stayed with its philosophy of seeking out lithe, agile wines. If you have followed us over the years, you will have seen the recommendations for many different specific bottles - Beaujolais, Loire reds, Italian reds, Oregon pinot noirs, rosés, sparklers and even ciders.
These all continue to be great choices. But we have come to realize that the specifics don't matter nearly so much as the character and energy of the wines. Acidity, balance and relatively low alcohol are the watchwords.
We have gotten good at finding bottles that fit these criteria, and this year was no exception. In fact, all eight bottles earned three stars, the equivalent of excellent choices. What separates them are scant degrees of preference. They were all that good.
For her white, Julia brought a Côtes du Rhône blanc, a 2019 Clémentia from Domaine les Aphillanthes, made from biodynamically farmed viognier, roussanne and clairette.
This was a counterintuitive wine, as viognier in particular can be overbearing, but this was well-focused and lively, a "sunny wine," Julia said, that offered its tropical fruit flavors without being too heavy.
Her red was our favorite, a 2018 Verduno Basadone from Castello di Verduno, made of pelaverga piccolo grapes organically farmed in the Langhe region of Italy.
While the area is best known for its Barolo and Barbaresco, Langhe also grows pelaverga piccolo, one of a group of lesser-known grapes that offer excellent values. It was fresh, bright, spicy and intriguing.
Florence, too, went against the grain with her white, selecting a so-called orange wine, a white with some of the characteristics of a red.
Many orange wines can seem idiosyncratic, and I often wonder whether people will want to drink them over the course of a long meal. This would be a good candidate to try.
Her red was a nonvintage pinot noir, the High Wire from Hound's Tree on the North Fork of Long Island - fresh, lively and refreshing.
I loved Thomas' white, a 2018 Mosel riesling from Julian Haart that was textured and rich with floral and stony mineral flavors. I called it a wake-up wine for the way it snapped me to attention, though Julia suggested it was maybe too bold.
Thomas' red came from Franck Balthazar, one of my favorite Cornas producers, who also has a small négociant operation. This 2018 Côtes du Rhône is 60% syrah and 40% grenache, farmed organically. It was spicy, earthy and complex, a lovely wine.
I stuck with American wines for my picks. My white, a 2018 Sonoma County chardonnay from Lioco, was tangy, textured and balanced, the sort of white wine that will go with almost anything.
My red was the 2017 Queen of the Sierra from Forlorn Hope, a blend of trousseau noir, mondeuse, zinfandel and a few other grapes, all organically grown in Calaveras County in the Sierra Foothills.

Texto completo: The claim: Stacey Abrams had the Georgia governorship stolen for her by a ‘corrupt’ secretary of state, then registered 800,000 new voters
As unfounded claims of fraud spread online in the wake of the 2020 election, previous questionable elections are coming back into the spotlight. An Instagram post depicts Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams beside text that claims her 2018 run for governor was stunted by a dirty politician.
“Stacy (sic) Abrams had the governorship of Georgia stolen from her by a corrupt Secretary of State who abused his office to suppress the vote and hand himself the election,” the Instagram post by liberal account The Other 98% reads. “What did she do? She rolled up her sleeves, registered 800,000 new voters and is about to flip her state blue.”
The Other 98% did not respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment.
Fact check: Post online about Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's 2018 win is partly false
2018 Georgia gubernatorial race
In 2018, Abrams ran for governor against Republican Brian Kemp, who at the time was Georgia’s secretary of state. As secretary of state, Kemp was in charge of running the state’s elections.
During his tenure in that role, he trimmed more than 1.4 million inactive voters, with low-income and minority Georgians most likely to have their registrations canceled, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Over 668,000 of those registrations were canceled in 2017. In the lead-up to the 2018 election, Georgia put 53,000 voter registrations on hold, the majority of them Black voters, for additional screening.
Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, told USA TODAY maintaining the accuracy of voter lists is permitted under law, which often means removing voters, and that the holds would not have stopped those Georgians from voting.
"All the person had to do is show up with their photo ID, which everyone has to have, and they would've been allowed to vote," he said. "But by making that claim, maybe that did inspire some more of those people to make sure that they did vote – both Democrats and Republicans."
Kemp did not resign from his role until he’d all but won the election, thus overseeing the election in which he was a candidate. But it's not uncommon for a secretary of state to continue holding that office while running in a race, Bullock said.
"Every secretary of state who has run for reelection as secretary of state in Georgia has held onto the office during that," he said. "It's just not that common for a secretary of state to run for governor."
Claims of broken voter machines, showing votes cast for Abrams as registering for Kemp arose, and 85,000 more voters were purged from rolls in the three months leading up to the election. Kemp has repeatedly denied he attempted to suppress the vote, USA TODAY previously reported.
Abrams lost to Kemp by nearly 55,000 votes in 2018. In her concession, Abrams said the outcome reflected voter suppression.
"I acknowledge that former Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election," Abrams said, according to NPR. "But to watch an elected official who claims to represent the people in this state baldly pin his hopes for election on suppression of the people's democratic right to vote has been truly appalling."
Still, nationally, the turnout in 2018 was higher than average by historical standards, FiveThirtyEight reported. In Georgia in 2018, "an estimated 55 percent of eligible voters exercised their right to vote, which is about 21 points higher than the state’s 1982-2014 average. That was the biggest change from the average of any state," FiveThirtyEight also reported.
The U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee opened an investigation in March 2019 into concerns over voter registration and voter access during the 2018 gubernatorial election and Kemp’s tenure as secretary of state, citing a particular concern of reports that Georgians, particularly people of color, “faced unprecedented challenges with registering to vote and significant barriers to casting their votes” during that election.
Fact check: Stacey Abrams paid outstanding taxes, but the Rev. Al Sharpton still owes
In March of this year, the committee, controlled by its Democratic majority, wrote in a memorandum that the Georgia secretary of state's and governor’s offices have acknowledged that they are withholding over 1,400 responsive documents from the committee, having released thousands of already-publicly available documents to lawmakers.
The committee wrote that despite that, it learned “new, concerning information” about voter suppression in Georgia. After removing more than 500,000 voters from rolls – perhaps the largest single cancellation of voter registrations in U.S. history, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution – Kemp and a top campaign staffer mocked a press release from a Democratic candidate that warned of systemic voter suppression in October 2017. They forwarded each other the press release, writing the word “us” with laughing and smiling emojis, according to the memorandum. The document lists a number of other areas the committee viewed as concerning.
Abrams maintains that the 2018 Georgia election process was not fair. She told the New York Times Magazine in April 2019 that while she recognizes Kemp secured enough votes to become governor, she "does not concede that the process was proper, nor do I condone that process.” Despite that, there is little empirical evidence Kemp stole the election.
Fact check: Critics satirically redact Trump's tweet to make it falsely appear he admitted defeat
Abrams registered upward of 800,000 new Georgia voters, credited with shifting the red state toward blue
It’s true that Abrams, through the efforts of her two organizations, Fair Fight and the New Georgia Project, registered upward of 800,000 new voters in the lead-up to the 2020 election, according to Politico. Many have credited Abrams for the state’s apparent shift to being more Democratic.
“Stacey Abrams had the foresight to rebuild the Democratic Party apparatus in Georgia by identifying the fact that there were a lot of latent voters in the state and by going after them,” Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie told The 19th. “She showed you could increase competitiveness not by worrying about trying to persuade the unpersuadable and demonstrated a lesson that will be copied in other places.”

But Abrams didn’t do it alone. She tweeted Nov. 6 that a number of organizing groups, like Asian Americans Advancing Justice and Black Votes Matter, deserve credit for being “in the trenches” of making change.
Our rating: Partly false
While Abrams has maintained the 2018 gubernatorial election was unfair and tainted by voter suppression, there’s no empirical evidence that now-Gov. Kemp stole that election from her. She did register over 800,000 new voters in time for the 2020 election, with help from other activists. We rate the claim PARTLY FALSE, because some of it is not supported by our research.

That Pig Couch on Craigslist? Not for Sale. (Also, Not a Couch.)

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Abigail Rowe already had a couch, a hand-me-down from her ex-boyfriend’s brother. Like most of her furniture, it was free and utilitarian, a placeholder for a more stylish piece that she would buy someday.
But someday arrived sooner than she expected. In 2018, Rowe was browsing the “free stuff” section on Craigslist when she saw the perfect couch: a bulging pink love seat shaped like a pig.
The upholstery was shiny, almost slick, as if the pig would gently rebuff any attempt to sit on it. Its eyes were vacant and slightly downcast. Its tail, a bit of unraveled yarn jutting from its hindquarters, looked like an afterthought compared to its carefully carved hooves.
“The pig is expressive and sort of downtrodden,” Rowe, 25, said. “It looks inviting.”
The person who posted the listing for the couch claimed to be a furniture artist named Andrew who was clearing out space in his studio. The ad said he would give the pig couch away, to anyone who could explain in detail what it meant to them.
Rowe replied to the post with a poem. When Andrew didn’t immediately respond, she began to doubt his intentions. A reverse image search showed that her fears were founded: Here was an ad from 2016 that claimed the couch was available in Nashville, Tennessee; there was another suggesting the pig couch could be picked up in Boca Raton, Florida.
Finally Andrew texted back, claiming he had been set up. A woman he’d met on OkCupid posted the ad and included his phone number after becoming angry when she learned that Andrew wasn’t vegan, he claimed in messages to Rowe that were viewed by The New York Times.
Rowe had fallen for a recurring Craigslist scam. For at least five years, people have used the site to claim that they are selling or giving away this particular pig couch, according to old listings unearthed by Rowe. It’s unclear if any of the posters have profited from the venture or if they are simply engaged in a lighthearted piece of performance art. (Some of the ads were posted on April Fools’ Day.)
On Tuesday, the pig couch reemerged, this time in New York City. “Unique Pig Couch,” the Craigslist post read. “Selling it for $250 even though my boyfriend and I bought it for over 11k and it’s in pristine condition. Need someone to pick it up ASAP as my new boyfriend hates it and sadly this is non-negotiable for him.”
The person behind the New York listing, Marisol Martinez, has a history of benevolent trolling on Craigslist.
In 2011 or 2012 — Martinez couldn’t remember — she got frustrated by her commute from Manhattan to Brooklyn and posted an ad soliciting someone to ferry her across the East River in a boat. She would not stick to a set schedule, she said in the ad, and the rides had to be free. Certain conversation topics would be off limits. Some people responded angrily, calling her arrogant. Others wrote her poetry. Some asked if she would chip in for gas.
“It proves the absurdity of a city that has so many weird people in it,” Martinez, 31, said. “It was a good start to understanding you can ask for things and get them in the city. And also, people will harass you.”
She moved on to other lighthearted posts. In one, she posed as a snail who had upgraded to a larger shell and sought to rent the old one. (“It’s perfect for the adolescent gastropod looking to expand his/her living space while avoiding predators. You’ll love the rare left-handed spiraling, steep aperture, and funky asymmetrical whorls.”) In another, she advertised her services as a “fragmented consciousness technician,” offering to repair people’s broken brains.
“I think I’m, in some definitions, a scammer,” Martinez said. “I was posting something that wasn’t true.”
She stumbled upon the pig couch while helping a friend search for a statement couch online and was immediately drawn to its “unsettling texture” and melancholic face. “I think a couch with a face is probably, from a biological standpoint, something we’re more likely to look at,” Martinez said.
By posting the fake ad, she wasn’t trying to steal anyone’s cash. Instead, she hoped to lift the spirits of her fellow New Yorkers during the seething collective nightmare of 2020.
“I thought that I would create a semibelievable but share-worthy or interest-worthy post so that people would be delighted by the weirdness of the city,” Martinez said. “I definitely don’t want to take anyone’s money or waste someone’s time who’s out here trying to buy a couch.”
Her post caught the eye of Rowe, who has made a hobby of cataloging the pig posts. It also got the attention of the creator of the pig couch itself — Pavia Burroughs, a 31-year-old fiber artist from Philadelphia.
First of all, Burroughs would like the world to know that it’s a chair, not a couch.
His name is “Hillhock,” a portmanteau of “hillock,” a small knoll on which to sit, and “ham hock,” a cut of pork. He is hand-stitched from velvet and satin and stuffed with foam, making him surprisingly lightweight despite his bulk.
He was originally part of a living room set — including a rug, a side table and a lamp — that Burroughs presented as part of her sculpture thesis in 2011. The rug, fashioned out of paper, was meant to look like dirt, and there were paper flowers, myrtle and bloodroot growing in it and climbing up onto Hillhock. The side table had a fiber root structure pouring out of one side. The lamp was a normal lamp.
Burroughs exhibited the chair, then tried to sell it. She didn’t get many takers, so she lowered the price. Several furniture blogs posted pictures of her work.
“It weirdly had a first life of going viral with blogs laughing at it,” she said. “When I finally sold it, it went into this weird virality of people pretending to sell it.”
The last public listing for Hillhock priced him at $950, but Burroughs said she recalls being bartered down to about $500. The buyer’s name was Matt, or Mike, by her memory, and he seemed like a businessman. He drove from Maryland to pick up the chair, which she had kept in her room and used as a repository for dirty laundry.
Nearly a decade later, Burroughs is still making art. It can be somewhat frustrating, but mostly funny, that such an old piece has become her most famous work.
“The pig couch now belongs to the internet. It’s bigger than me, I have no ownership,” Burroughs said. “Were any of the Craigslist posts real? Is it actually traveling around the country?”
Hillhock, it turns out, is still in Maryland. The buyer, a cybersecurity executive named Martin Roesch, drove the pig couch straight from Philadelphia to the offices of his startup, Sourcefire. Roesch’s company made software called Snort, which sniffed at packets of internet traffic to detect threats, and its mascot was a pig.
“This thing was supercool, and I was like, ‘Oh God, I have to have it,’” Roesch said. “It does have this kind of forlorn look on its face, I think due to its eyes. I think it’s cute more than sad.” When he installed the chair in his office, his employees were rapt.
In 2013, Sourcefire was acquired by Cisco, and Hillhock moved with the company to the Cisco office in Maryland, where the chair ended up in a meeting room, Roesch said. “I think it became more of a conversation piece at that point, although I did see people sitting on it from time to time,” he said.
Roesch left Cisco last year and said the piece remains “on loan” to his former employer.
Since its most recent turn as a viral sensation, Roesch has received several offers to buy the couch. He is considering them.

Texto completo: The claim: The actual electoral vote count has Trump at 410, Biden at 128
The state of Georgia is slated to finish its recount this week. If President-elect Joe Biden keeps his lead, he will end the presidential contest with a total of 306 electoral votes versus 232 for President Donald Trump.
But some users on Facebook claim that isn't the real outcome — or even close to it. They based their claims on One America News Network, known as OANN or OAN.
"OANN ran the story...True Electoral Vote," a user wrote. "Trump: 410, Biden: 128."
Another user posted an image of an electoral map that also shows Trump at 410 votes and Biden at 128 votes with the caption, "OAN reporting."
The users have not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.
Fact check: Dominion voting machines didn't delete votes from Trump, switch them to Biden
What is One America News Network?
One America News Network is a conservative cable network. It was founded in 2013 by businessman Robert Herring and is led by his son Charles Herring, according to The Guardian.
It has developed a reputation for airing baseless conspiracy theories and spreading false information, including about COVID-19.
NewsGuard — a network of journalists that evaluates news sites for reliability — urges readers and advertisers to “proceed with caution” with One America News Network, per The New York Times.
Specifically, it found that OANN “severely violates basic standards of credibility and transparency” and regularly includes “false or distorted information."
It has also spread numerous debunked claims since the election, including about election software by Dominion Voting Systems — which did not delete or change votes, per another fact check by USA TODAY.
Fact check: Critics satirically redact Trump's tweet to make it falsely appear he admitted defeat
Why did its map have Trump at 410 and Biden at 128?
The map that showed Trump at 410 votes and Biden at 128 was displayed in the middle of a segment on the conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army conducted a raid in Germany to seize servers with election-related info.
"New reports claim the real results of the 2020 U.S. election were found on a computer server that was seized by the U.S. military in Frankfurt, Germany," the anchor is heard explaining in a clip of the segment on YouTube.
Then, a tweet with the map flashes on screen as the anchor explains that it is "allegedly based off of the data from that server" (though the tweet is only sourced to a defeated congressional candidate.)
"It shows a landslide victory for President Trump with 410 Electoral College votes, including liberal strongholds California and Minnesota," the anchor concludes.
The conspiracy theory about the seized servers has been previously debunked by USA TODAY.
The U.S. Army confirmed that there was no raid, and the software company in question, Scytl, explained that it does not currently have servers in Germany.
Chris Krebs — who was the director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency prior to his firing on Tuesday — also debunked the claims on Twitter.
"Election-related servers WERE NOT recently seized in Europe by the US Army contrary to #disinfo rapidly spreading across social media," he wrote on Saturday.
More: Trump ousts Homeland Security cyber chief Chris Krebs, who called election secure
Other fact-checkers — including the Associated Press, Reuters, PolitiFact, and The New York Times — have also discredited claims about the raid.
Since there was no raid, the map that individuals claimed came from the seized servers, which showed Trump at 410 and Biden at 138, is also fake.
The map is also very unrealistic. As the anchor noted, it shows California turning red— when the state has been won by Democrats in every presidential contest since 1992.
This time around, Biden received 63.7% of the vote in California, compared with 34.2% for Trump, according to the state website.
Fact check: Story of Army raid to seize election servers in Germany is false
Our rating: False
Based on our research, the claim that the actual electoral vote count has Donald Trump at 410 and Joe Biden at 128 is FALSE. Those numbers are based on false reports that the U.S. Army seized servers with election information on them in a recent raid in Germany. USA TODAY and other fact checkers have already debunked those reports.

Texto completo: She takes the reins at a time of rising tensions between management and the paper's union.
Linda Pizzuti Henry on Wednesday became the chief executive officer of Boston Globe Media Partners, the parent company of The Boston Globe, Boston.com and STAT News. Along with her husband, John W. Henry, Ms. Henry is an owner of Boston Globe Media Partners, the Boston Red Sox and the Liverpool Football Club.
"I feel really lucky to be able to work every day at a place that I love, doing work that I know is critically important and impactful to a community I care deeply about," Ms. Henry, the first woman to lead The Globe in its 148-year history, said in a statement.
Mr. Henry, 71, bought The Boston Globe from The New York Times Company as part of a $ 70 million deal for New England Media Group in 2013. Since then, Ms. Henry has been managing director of Boston Globe Media Partners.
Ms. Henry, 42, is taking the top job at a time of rising tensions between The Globe's management and its union, which have been in negotiations over a new contract since the last one expired at the end of 2018.
Matt Rocheleau, a Globe investigative reporter and the union's recording secretary, said the elevation of Ms. Henry did not offer the staff much hope for a swift conclusion.
"It really depends on if she is going to take a different approach to what has been taken," he said in an interview. "We haven't seen yet any signal that management is going to change, but we hope it does."
The promotion of Ms. Henry was announced on a day when Globe employees criticized ties between the newspaper and the Jones Day law firm, which has represented President Trump and his campaign and has been representing the Republican Party of Pennsylvania in litigation over mail-in votes.
In an open letter to the Henrys and other executives on Wednesday, Globe union members said Boston Globe Media Partners' use of Jones Day raised ethical issues and asked the company to reconsider its relationship with the firm. The Times reported this month that some Jones Day lawyers said they were concerned that the firm's recent work was undermining the integrity of the electoral system. The Globe has used Jones Day since 2014, a spokeswoman said.
"Given the Globe's wide-ranging coverage of election-related news, we believe readers have a right to be aware of the relationship between The Globe and Jones Day, just as Globe readers have routinely been informed of the business relationship between Globe ownership and the Boston Red Sox," the letter said.
Mr. Rocheleau said the paper's journalism must be free from any apparent conflicts of interest. "The Globe has run New York Times wire stories about Jones Day, about election-related lawsuits, and there was no disclosure about the relationship to the company with Jones Day," he said.
Ms. Henry spoke to Globe employees during a virtual meeting on Wednesday. "I believe in our purpose, in our mission and in how much the work we do matters," she said, according to a report in The Globe.
Ms. Henry effectively replaces Vinay Mehra, who left Boston Globe Media Partners in June after three years as its president.

Texto completo: Here's everything you need to know about John Brown's actual raid at Harpers Ferry, dramatized in Sunday's series finale of the Showtime historical drama.
"The Good Lord Bird," the Showtime mini-series about the incendiary career of the 19th-century abolitionist John Brown (its seven-episode run ended Sunday night), offered a stylish, consciously cockeyed view of America on the brink of the Civil War -- more Lin-Manuel Miranda than Ron Chernow. But its fantastical-seeming story, based on the National Book Award-winning novel of the same name by James McBride, is more factual than casual students of American history might assume.
The show, like McBride's novel, uses an invented sidekick character (an enslaved boy masquerading as a girl nicknamed Little Onion, played by Joshua Caleb Johnson) to frame a simultaneously awe-struck and irreverent portrait of Brown, played by Ethan Hawke as a Bible-quoting revolutionary determined to wage a violent holy war against American slavery and its defenders.
But many aspects of the narrative -- including the roles of more prominent historical figures like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, and much of the depiction of Brown's fateful, would-be insurrection at a federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Va. (now part of West Virginia) -- are lifted directly from the historical record.
Here is a guide to what was fact and what was fiction in the series, based on the writings of historians and contemporaneous New York Times reporting. (Spoilers historical and otherwise follow.)
What did John Brown hope to achieve at Harpers Ferry?
Onscreen: Brown declares his intention to "ignite the fuse that will start a great war to end slavery."
In real life: Brown spoke frequently of his desire to provoke just such a conflict, though it didn't play out as he had envisioned. He described himself as engaged in an "eternal war against slavery," according to the historian Tony Horwitz, and referred to slavery itself as "a most barbarous, unprovoked and unjustifiable war of one portion of its citizens upon another portion." Unlike other abolitionists, Brown thought that the violence of slavery demanded violence in return. In a precursor to the Harpers Ferry raid that became known as the Pottawatomie Massacre of 1856, he and his men murdered five settlers in Franklin County, Kan., in retaliation for an attack on abolitionists in the territory. Afterward, a defiant Brown said he had aimed to "strike terror in the hearts of the proslavery people."
The raid at Harpers Ferry, conducted three years after the Kansas killings, was the first step in a grand plan for an armed rebellion that would conquer slavery throughout the land. In an interview printed in The New York Times in 1859, after Brown's arrest, his wife, Mary, said that her husband had hoped to spark the revolt for much of his adult life.
"He had been waiting 20 years for some opportunity to free the slaves," she said. "When at last the enterprise at Harpers Ferry was planned, we all thought that the time had now come."
How did he plan to achieve it?
Onscreen: In Episode 4, Brown outlines his plan to raid the armory at Harpers Ferry with a small band of Black and white fighters, arm thousands of free and enslaved Black people in the region and retreat to the Blue Ridge Mountains, "defeating the pro-slavers as we go." He claims that Douglass (Daveed Diggs) and Tubman (Zainab Jah), whom he meets with in earlier episodes, will rally the support of thousands near and far. To finance the operation, he relies in part on the support of a mysterious cabal of benefactors in New England known as the "Secret Six."
In real life: Brown's plans were close to what was depicted. He chose Harpers Ferry as his target because the armory there was known to be lightly guarded, and because of its location in Virginia, seen as a gateway to the slaveholding South. As The Times reported in a story about the raid that included an interview with Brown: "He expected to receive a rapid increase of allies from abolitionists everywhere settled through Maryland and Virginia, sufficient to take possession of both states, with all of the Negroes they could capture."
Brown did indeed appeal to Douglass, a friend who once said that Brown "though a white gentleman is, in sympathy, a Black man," and to Tubman, who he had sought out a year earlier. But neither took part in the raid. Douglass, who disapproved of the use of violence, wrote that he had warned Brown that "he was going into a perfect steel trap, and that once in he would never get out alive."
The "Secret Six" were a real committee of wealthy abolitionists -- Gerrit Smith, Samuel Gridley Howe, Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, George L. Stearns, Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Theodore Parker -- who had backed Brown's exploits in Kansas. Years after the Harpers Ferry raid, Sanborn, using a pseudonym, wrote that the group had supplied Brown with $ 500 and some weaponry for the mission.
Who took part in the raid?
Onscreen: Brown arrives in Virginia in October 1859 with around a dozen men, including four of his sons (Owen, John Jr., Salmon and Jason), Ottawa Jones of Kansas, and several free Black men, including Lewis Leary, Dangerfield Newby, O.P. Anderson and Attucks Copeland, a student at Oberlin College. Douglass's associate, Shields "Emperor" Green, parts ways with Douglass to fight with Brown. Onion and an oafish abolitionist named Cook, who were dispatched to Harpers Ferry in advance, recruit a handful of locals to the cause, including several slaves of the prominent resident Col. Lewis Washington -- the great-grandnephew of George Washington. Washington himself is kidnapped and held hostage during the fighting. An important subplot involves an enigmatic train conductor, known only as The Rail Man, who is tasked with rounding up further Black recruits.
In real life: Just three of Brown's sons participated in the raid (he had at least 20 children), and not the three that are depicted on the show. Owen was there guarding a supply house near the arsenal, but John Jr., Salmon and Jason were not present. It was two of Brown's other sons, Watson and Oliver, who joined in the attack.
With the exception of Onion, the other raiders -- Jones, Leary, Newby, Anderson, Copeland, Green and Cook -- are based on real characters, although Jones didn't participate in the raid. Lewis Washington really was taken hostage. But the real life "Rail Man" wasn't an accomplice of Brown's. He was a porter named Heyward Shepherd who was shot and killed tragically during an attempt by Brown's men to seize the town's central train station.
What went wrong?
Onscreen: The plan begins to go awry long before Brown even arrives in Harpers Ferry and crumbles further at nearly every turn. Because of Cook's antics in the town, nosy neighbors discover Brown's plot, forcing him to move up the date of the attack and foreclosing the possibility of assistance from Tubman. A miscommunication leads to The Rail Man's death and the scattering of would-be recruits. After Brown and his men seize the engine house of the armory, the mayor of the town is shot and killed while attempting to negotiate, causing a furor. Federal troops arrive, among them the future Confederate general J.E.B. Stuart (Wyatt Russell), and after a tumultuous two-day shootout, Brown and his men are easily overtaken, still waiting in vain for an army of imagined sympathizers.
In real life: John Cook, one of Brown's acolytes, was sent to Harpers Ferry in advance to gather intelligence and liaise with the townspeople there, including Lewis Washington. But the story of his antics, and of their fateful consequences for Brown's mission, is largely the show's invention. As for the hoped-for rendezvous with Tubman, the historian Kate Clifford Larson suggests that the Underground Railroad pioneer did at one point recruit former slaves to fight with Brown, but it's unclear why the two failed to connect at the time of the Harpers Ferry raid.
The rest of what is shown in the series (aside from the Onion story line) is based on true events. Brown's men expected that thousands of free and enslaved Black people would join their efforts and were dismayed when they failed to materialize, according to interviews in The Times. After early reports of the incident reached Washington, Robert E. Lee, then a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, led a company of federal troops, Stuart among them, that surrounded Brown's men at the engine house and shut down the uprising. In the end, 16 people were killed. Ten of Brown's combatants, including his sons Watson and Oliver, were among the dead. Five insurgents, including Owen Brown, escaped. John Brown and six others, including Cook, were captured and jailed.
What were the consequences?
Onscreen: Brown writes a series of letters from prison that turn him into a martyr figure and bring national attention to his cause. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Walt Whitman are said to be among his champions. After a visit from Onion, during which he expresses peaceful resignation about his fate, Brown is hanged. His last words are "What a beautiful country." Narration from Frederick Douglass provides his eulogy: "John Brown's zeal for the cause of freedom was infinitely superior to mine. I could live for the slave, John Brown could die for him."
In real life: Brown's letters, in which he described his vision for a post-slavery America in eloquent and spiritual terms, were hugely influential in accelerating the abolition movement and putting slaveholders on the defensive. In the presidential election of 1860, pro-slavery Southern Democrats, determined to take a more aggressive stance to defend the institution, split the party vote, helping to clear a path for the Republican candidate, Abraham Lincoln. Brown, along with the rest of his captured men, was indeed hanged, although it's unclear what his last words were. In one of his letters from prison, he wrote "I am worth now infinitely more to die than to live." In the audience for the hanging were Lt. Col. Lee, future Confederate general Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson and John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln's future assassin.
In addition to Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman, Brown's admirers included the poet Julia Ward Howe, wife of the "Secret Six" member Samuel Gridley Howe, who took a popular folk song about Brown, "John Brown's Body," and turned it into "Battle Hymn of the Republic." Douglass's quote from the show is taken from an address he gave in 1881 at Storer College, a school founded for freed slaves after the Civil War in the town of Harpers Ferry.

Texto completo: With COVID case numbers rising, democracy quaking and Thanksgiving basically canceled, why on earth are so many people talking about a Netflix limited series?
Because “The Queen’s Gambit” is a perfect distraction. It has everything we need to take our minds off the present moment: an engaging story, characters we care about, great sets, gorgeous period costumes and chess. Lots of chess. More than 300 chess games are played or glimpsed over the series’ seven hour-long episodes.
You don’t play chess? Same here. But we loved watching it being played and the many ways it was filmed: speeded up, slo-mo, from above, from the side, as a “Brady Bunch” grid of games and players. We loved watching a young girl become obsessed with the game and insist on learning it, insist on playing it, and eventually insist on being the best player in the world, despite the fact that chess has mostly been a man’s game.
“The Queen’s Gambit” slid onto Netflix on Oct. 23 with little fanfare. Suddenly it was just there, waiting to be discovered and consumed. Overnight, people started bingeing it, writing about it and heaping praise on it. The series jumped to the top of the Netflix charts and stayed. (Supposedly it’s on track to break the record set by “Tiger King.”)
We read something about it somewhere and decided to take a look. We didn’t watch the whole series in one sitting, but it was all we watched for the next few days. As the final episode’s credits rolled, we returned to the first episode to refresh our memory on a detail, got pulled back in and seriously considered watching the whole thing again. It had been such a pleasure we didn’t want to let it go.
The star of the series is Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays Beth Harmon, a fictional chess savant. (The series is based on a novel by American writer Walter Tevis, published in 1983. Tevis also wrote “The Hustler,” “The Color of Money” and “The Man Who Fell to Earth.” He had a knack for writing stories that translated well to screens.) Taylor-Joy starred in the most recent version of “Emma” (2020), based on the Jane Austen novel. But she’s probably best known for her roles in “The Witch,” “Split” and “Glass,” all horror films.
Although she doesn’t play chess, her training as a dancer prepared her to handle the chess pieces with authority. She’s good at remembering steps, and she thought of the moves as choreography for her fingers.
Other familiar names in the cast are Marielle Heller (she directed “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood”), Thomas Brodie-Sangster (“Godless,” “Wolf Hall,” “Game of Thrones”) and Harry Melling (Dudley Dursley in the “Harry Potter” films).
Set in the 1950s and ’60s, “The Queen’s Gambit” could have been a dark story. We kept expecting it to go that way. When Beth’s mother dies in a car crash, Beth ends up in an orphanage. She learns to play chess from a cranky, taciturn janitor — just the two of them, alone in the basement of that big old orphanage. One day, she’s taken to the local high school to play the whole chess team, all privileged, briefcase-toting young men who view her with scorn and resentment. She’s in her mid-teens when she’s finally adopted — by an unhappy couple. When she starts playing tournaments, she’s usually the only girl competing.
But it’s not a dark story. It’s one where a gifted young woman has a group of gifted young men as friends who cheer her on and want her to succeed. Where the relationship between a girl and an older man is mutually respectful. Where an orphanage isn’t a hellhole. Where a cruelly cold adoptive parent doesn’t ruin your life but is more like an annoying bump on the road. Where you can survive terrible things — a biological father who abandons you, a mother with mental health issues — and even overcome them.
Beth has her own problems; an addiction to pills she picked up at the orphanage, an addiction to alcohol she learned from her adoptive mother, trouble forming healthy romantic relationships. She has work to do. But there’s hope for her, and she has hope for herself as she becomes the chess champion she’s meant to be.
There’s some sex, but not much, and little violence, unless you count the car crash. Nothing blows up. No one carries a gun. The most obvious use of CGI is in scenes where young Beth lies in bed at night imagining chess games on the ceiling. Shadows coalesce into squares on a chess board and chess pieces grow downward like giant stalactites. It’s strange and thrilling. Many moments in the series are so beautiful you’ll back up to see them again. You’ll be happy/sad when the series ends.
As a bonus, you’ll be watching real chess. In an article for the New York Times, chess master Dylan Loeb McClain wrote, “When it comes to how chess is portrayed onscreen, chess players are a notoriously picky and unforgiving crowd. We will pounce on any mistake. Though ‘The Queen’s Gambit’ has its flaws, in the end the series is a clear winner.”
The picks
V is virtual, L is live and in person. Once more, Thursday rules.
V Thursday (Nov. 19) online: Northrop: Gallim: A New Dance Film by Andrea Miller and Helix Films based on “BOAT.” Words can’t do this justice; please see the trailer. Miller has said that creating a new film during COVID “felt like a miracle and a gift.” The original plan was for Gallim, her dance company, to perform “BOAT” live at Northrop in November. When COVID nixed that, Gallim and Kristen Brogdon, Northrop’s director of programming, made “BOAT” into a film. The dance explores what it feels like and means to be searching for home; the music is by Arvo Pärt. The film was co-directed by Ben Stamper of Helix Films and features University Organist Dean Billmeyer on Northrop’s mighty pipe organ and the Twin Cities PopUp Choir on vocals. Thursday’s premiere will be followed by a conversation with the artists. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($25/10). The film will be available on demand through Sunday, Nov. 29.
V Thursday (Nov. 19) online: SubText Books : William Souder presents “Mad at the World: A Life of John Steinbeck.” Minnesota author Souder has earned shining reviews for his latest biography, which follows his earlier biographies of Rachel Carson, a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, and John James Audubon, a Pulitzer Prize finalist. He’ll be in conversation with Milkweed Editions’ publisher and CEO, Daniel Slager. (Milkweed published Souder’s Audubon biography, “Under a Wild Sky.”) 7 p.m. Free, but registration is required.
V Tomorrow (Thursday, Nov. 19) online: Give to the Max Day. Your email box is likely flooded with Give to the Max pleas and requests. Our favorite so far is from Swandive Theatre, which suggests we give to someone else. Their board suggests Open Arms of Minnesota, which provides hundreds of thousands of nutritious meals each year for people living with illness, their caregivers, and dependents. If you’re able to give and you want some guidance, the givemn.org website can point you toward organizations that have been significantly impacted by COVID and those that are BIPOC-led and serving. Give to the Max Day launched in 2009; this may be the year when it matters most.
V Thursday through Sunday (Nov. 19-22) on Zoom: Park Square Theatre: “Tears of Moons.” A poetic solo show written and performed by Antonio Duke, directed by Ellen Fenster. Winding through time on the No. 5 bus, “Tears of Moons” illustrates why racism and our racist past continue to haunt us. Structured around a Homeric narrator, it weaves in other characters, victims of racial violence, some recognizable from news headlines and others whose stories have been lost. Duke wrote the play in 2015 and has updated it in response to current events. The performance was filmed on Park Square’s Boss Stage and will be shown four times, each followed by a live post-show conversation with Duke, Fenster and a moderator. It will not be available for streaming on demand. 7:30 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday. FMI and tickets ($25).

Texto completo: President Trump's supporters should quickly dry their eyes because there is something quickly approaching that they surely won't want to miss: the Hunger Games that are about to play out in the Democratic Party.
Democrats know that despite their success in denying Trump another term, things actually went horribly for them this entire election year, and if not for the pandemic, hyped up by the national media, everyone else would be acutely aware of what a freak show the party has been putting on.
This election, Democrats saw their majority unexpectedly dwindle in the House, giving Republicans a decent shot at taking over in 2022. State legislatures also remained in Republican control, and the GOP actually flipped the Legislature in New Hampshire. Democrats, despite having dumped buckets of money into state-level races, flipped none. And though they've seized the presidency, what will it have earned them? Trump is gone, but now, we're looking at an administration run by a 78-year-old white man who has spent his entire adult life in Washington and who likely won't be able to do, or won't care to do, 95% of what liberals have their hopes up for.
Power in the Senate won't be decided until the special election for both of Georgia's Senate seats, but the state hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate in more than two decades. If Republicans win at least one of the races, they will certainly block anything on Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar's wish list.
Several Democrats who lost or nearly lost their bids for reelection in more centrist districts complained immediately after defeat about the extremists in their party who wouldn't shut up about wanting to defund the police. The extremists have so far answered that with a shrug.
Liberals at the New York Times know this is a fast-approaching train wreck. The panic is all over the paper's op-ed pages this week.
In a plea for the fractured party to "stop fighting," New York Times liberal writer Michelle Goldberg wrote Monday that "2020 was a reminder of something most older liberals long ago had to come to terms with: The voters who live in the places that determine political control in this country tend to be more conservative than we are."
The paper's smartest liberal, Thomas Edsall, blamed the "tragic legacy of the Trump administration" for Democrats' intensifying woes, but he also knows what's up. "Liberal advocacy groups have become more in-your-face, more intense," he said, a reality that is crippling the party's ability at large to advance any of its platform ideals.
It feels like a long time ago, but anyone paying attention to the Democratic presidential primary circus earlier this year would have seen this coming. They dared one another to pledge that as president, they would break down all barriers at the southern border; make free healthcare an entitlement for illegal immigrants; and decriminalize unauthorized entry into the country. Each candidate tried to outdo the other in declaring just how racist America was as a country. (Bernie Sanders took the gold on that one when he said that the United States was racist "from top to bottom.")
None of this will be left behind in 2020. It was eclipsed by the coronavirus and the national media's collective hatred for Trump, but it's coming back quickly, and the fun is just getting started.

Thomas L. Friedman: Trump runs red light. Almost kills Lady Liberty.

Texto completo: So how do I feel two weeks after our election? Awed and terrified. I am in awe at the expression of democracy that took place in America. It was our most impressive election since 1864 and maybe our most important since 1800. And yet, I am still terrified that, but for a few thousand votes in key states, how easily it could have been our last election.
To put my feelings in image form: It’s like Lady Liberty was walking across Fifth Avenue on Nov. 3 when out of nowhere a crazy guy driving a bus ran the red light. Lady Liberty leapt out of the way barely in time, and she’s now sitting on the curb, her heart pounding, just glad to be alive. But she knows — she knows — how narrowly she escaped, that this reckless driver never stops at red lights and is still out there, and, oh my God, lots of his passengers are still applauding the thrilling ride, even though deep down many know he’s a menace to the whole city.
Let’s unpack all of this. Stop for a second and think about how awesome this election was. In the middle of an accelerating pandemic substantially more Americans voted than ever before in our history — Republicans, Democrats and independents. And it was their fellow citizens who operated the polling stations and conducted the count — many of them older Americans who volunteered for that duty knowing they could contract the coronavirus, as some did.
That’s why this was our greatest expression of American democratic vitality since Abraham Lincoln defeated Gen. George B. McClellan in 1864 — in the midst of a civil war. And that’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to soil this election, with his fraudulent claims of voting fraud, are so vile.
If Trump and his enablers had resisted for only a day or two, OK, no big deal. But the fact that they continue to do so, flailing for ways to overturn the will of the people, egged on by their media toadies — Lou Dobbs actually said on Fox Business that the GOP should refuse to accept the election results that deny Trump “what is rightfully his” — raises this question:
How do you trust this version of the Republican Party to ever hold the White House again?
Its members have sat mute while Trump, rather than using the federal bureaucracy to launch a war against our surging pandemic, has launched a war against his perceived enemies inside that federal bureaucracy — including the defense secretary, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration and, on Tuesday, the most senior cybersecurity official responsible for protecting the presidential election — weakening it when we need it most.
Engineering Trump’s internal purge is 30-year-old Johnny McEntee, “a former college quarterback who was hustled out of the White House two years ago after a security clearance check turned up a prolific habit for online gambling,” but Trump later welcomed him back and installed him as personnel director for the entire U.S. government, The Washington Post reported.
A political party that will not speak up against such a reckless leader is not a party any longer. It is some kind of populist cult of personality.
That’s been obvious ever since this GOP was the first party to conclude its presidential nominating convention without offering any platform. It declared that its platform was whatever its Dear Leader said it was. That is cultlike.
Are we just supposed to forget this GOP’s behavior as soon as Trump leaves and let its leaders say: “ Hey fellow Americans, Trump tried to overturn the election with baseless claims — and we went along for the ride — but he’s gone now, so you can trust us to do the right things again.”
That is why we are so very lucky that this election broke for Joe Biden. If this is how this Republican Party behaves when Trump loses, imagine how willing to tolerate his excesses it would have been had he won? Trump wouldn’t have stopped at any red lights ever again.
And the people who understood that best were democrats all over the world — particularly in Europe. Because they’ve watched Trump-like, right-wing populists in Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Russia and Belarus, as well as the Philippines, get themselves elected and then take control of their courts, media, internet and security institutions and use them to try to cripple their opponents and lock themselves into office indefinitely.
Democrats abroad feared that this same political virus would overtake America if Trump were reelected and have a devastating effect.
They feared that the core democratic concept that America gifted to the world in 1800 — when John Adams lost his election to Thomas Jefferson and peacefully handed over the reins of power — was going to wither, undermining democracy movements across the globe. Every autocrat would have been emboldened to ignore red lights.
Seeing an American president actually try to undermine the results of a free and fair election “is a warning to democrats all over the world: Don’t play lightly with populists, they will not leave power easily the way Adams did when he lost to Jefferson,” the French foreign policy expert Dominique Moïsi remarked to me.
That is why Biden’s mission — and the mission of all decent conservatives — is not just to repair America. It is to marginalize this Trumpian version of the GOP and help to nurture a healthy conservative party — one that brings conservative approaches to economic growth, infrastructure, social policy, education, regulation and climate change, but also cares about governing and therefore accepts compromises.
Democrats can’t summon a principled conservative party. That requires courageous conservatives. But Democrats do need to ask themselves why Trump remains so strong among white working-class voters without college degrees, and, in this last election, drew greater support from Black, Latino and white women voters.
There is a warning light flashing for Democrats from this election: They can’t rely on demographics. They need to make sure that every voter understands that the Democratic Party is a “both/and” party, not an “either/or” party. And they need to do it before a smarter, less crude Trump comes along to advance Trumpism.
They need every American to understand that Democrats are for BOTH redividing the pie AND growing the pie, for both reforming police departments and strengthening law and order, for both saving lives in a pandemic and saving jobs, for both demanding equity in education and demanding excellence, for both strengthening safety nets and strengthening capitalism, for both celebrating diversity and celebrating patriotism, for both making college cheaper and making the work of noncollege-educated Americans more respected, for both building a high border wall and incorporating a big gate, for both high-fiving the people who start companies and supporting the people who regulate them.
And they need to demand less political correctness and offer more tolerance for those who want to change with the times but need to get there their own ways — without feeling shamed into it.
We need our next presidential election to be fought between a principled center-right Republican Party and a “both/and” Democratic Party. Great countries are led from a healthy center. Weak countries don’t have one.

Texto completo: Bozeman, Mont. • During the recent U.S. Senate race in Montana — the most expensive in state history — those scamps at the Lincoln Project spent more than $2.5 million trying to help Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock usurp the incumbent Republican Steve Daines. Did their investment pay off? Definitely — assuming it was a sneaky plot to bankroll trail maintenance at Yellowstone.
Bullock — the current governor — and all the other Montana Democrats running statewide were, as a Billings Gazette headline put it, “trounced.” When I heard a TV pundit mention that the party will spend the next few years “in the wilderness,” it occurred to me that given Montanans' affection for the backcountry we need a more regionally appropriate figurative sphere of exile — perhaps “North Dakota”?
The fact that moderate, experienced Democratic candidates from Bullock on down won urban precincts in Butte, Bozeman and Missoula but could not overcome this election’s sky-high rural turnout confirms senior Sen. Jon Tester’s admonition in his recent memoir, “Grounded,” warning his fellow Democrats that in rural America, “We are getting whupped in the messaging war.”
The messages that do seem to work are getting more disturbing and less true. I wonder how many voters fell for Daines’s darkest campaign ad, in which the Wibaux County sheriff accused Bullock of being a tool of the “liberal mob” and “left-wing radicals” who will “defund our police, erase our history and turn America into a socialist country.”
The closest the strait-laced Bullock has ever gotten to a liberal mob was that time he and Tester filmed themselves enjoying the state’s lack of a sales tax at the drive through of a Taco John’s . And in fact, during the last legislative session, Bullock signed into law a Republican bill to increase the lodging tax to pay for a new history museum, the Montana Heritage Center, and attended its groundbreaking ceremony in September. Yet I suspect “erase our history” is a nativist, pro-Confederate dog whistle that indicates how political rhetoric has been nationalized here in the former Montana Territory, designated by Abraham Lincoln in 1864.
Further south in the mountain time zone, John Hickenlooper of Colorado defeated the Republican Sen. Cory Gardner. Though Bullock was thwarted and Hickenlooper has yet to be sworn in, they are nevertheless already the most accomplished conservation senators of this century. Panicked by the threat posed to a Republican-controlled Senate by this pair of mild-mannered Rocky Mountain dads, in August Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump rushed into law the Great American Outdoors Act.
Public lands account for more than a third of Colorado and Montana. As Bullock once bellowed to a raucous rally in Helena’s capitol rotunda, “Whether you’re a bird hunter or a bird watcher, each and every one of us equally owns these public lands!”
The Great American Outdoors Act was a frantic attempt to fluff up the ecological credentials of Gardner and Daines to appeal to the Mountain West’s constituency of independents, woodsy conservatives and the outdoor recreation work force, which provides Montana more than 71,000 jobs.
Thus a coal-monger president who gutted the Bears Ears National Monument and a U.S. Senate majority leader with a lifetime score of 7 percent from the League of Conservation Voters made the dreams of generations of tree-huggers come true.
The Outdoors Act earmarks $9.5 billion to address the age-old maintenance backlogs in national parks and other public lands. If Americans no longer share our supposedly shared ideals, we still have joint custody of the Everglades and Glacier Bay, Mesa Verde and the Angel Island immigration station, the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial and Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park.
This law also permanently and fully finances the Land and Water Conservation Fund, founded during Lyndon Johnson’s administration in 1964, at $900 million per year. The Conservation Fund has supported 40,000 projects assisting parks, coastlines, monuments, deserts, forests, wetlands and wildlife in every county in the United States. It is subsidized not by taxpayers but primarily by fossil fuel companies engaged in offshore oil and gas drilling. But before the Outdoors Act, it rarely received what it was owed, partly because senators like Daines voted against it.
That the Outdoors Act was a cynical election year ruse to prop up Trump’s senatorial groupies was made obvious this month when the Interior Department blew the deadline to follow through on Outdoors Act projects for the coming year and ordered the Conservation Fund to seek local approval of land purchases, endangering, as Montana Public Radio reported, $13 million earmarked for Montana “that would protect hunting and other recreation land along the Blackfoot River” and “open up over 9,000 acres of land near the Musselshell River.”
Like all his other cabinet officials, a daunting to-do list awaits Joe Biden’s interior secretary.
Two days before Biden was proclaimed president-elect, Daines texted his supporters to kick in $5 to pay for Trump’s legal shenanigans to undermine the continuing vote count because “Dems are stealing the election.”
I want to do my part to help Joe Biden bring the country back together, but on the other hand I’m a smart aleck who’s stuck with six more years of Daines, my new state auditor is a convicted poacher and I refer to my governor-elect, Greg Gianforte, who famously pleaded guilty to assaulting a journalist, as “Buffy the Reporter Slayer.”
When Gianforte — Daines’s old boss at a Bozeman software firm — was running for Montana’s lone House seat in 2017, Freeman E. Robinson of Big Arm, a town on Flathead Lake, wrote a letter to the Flathead Beacon about reading Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essay “Self-Reliance” as a boy and how Gianforte exemplified the Montana value of self-reliance by starting his own successful business (which he sold to Oracle in 2011 for $1.5 billion).
At Bozeman High School, which is also Daines’s alma mater, when my English teacher read aloud from Emerson’s essay, “Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist,” I looked over at the class’s other beatnik and we both grinned because an illustrious dead New Englander had just given us permission to go forth and live lives of bohemian adventure. And I wanted to light out and see the world precisely because I wanted to encounter strangers who do not think like me.
Based on the recent Montana election results I didn’t need to schlep all the way to Tibet. I should just spend a week hanging around exotic Richland County, where Daines beat Bullock by 62 points. And I would start by asking the people of Sidney or Fairview the icebreaker question that almost never fails: What’s your favorite national park?

Texto completo: Officials are still counting votes for the 2020 presidential election, but that hasn’t stopped professional commentators from drawing any number of broad conclusions about the state of American politics from the results thus far.
Two narratives about what happened stand out. First, the idea that left-wing slogans like “defund the police” cratered the Democratic Party in down ballot fights for the House and Senate, and second, that President Donald Trump’s modest gains with Black and Hispanic voters herald the arrival of a working-class, multiracial Republican Party.
There are obvious objections to both stories. There is no hard evidence that voters turned against Democratic congressional candidates because of “defund the police” and other radical slogans. It does not show up in the congressional generic ballot — there is no decline that corresponds with the unrest of the summer — and there’s little other data to support the idea of a direct causal relationship between the slogans and the performance of Democratic candidates.
What we have, instead, are the words of moderate Democratic lawmakers who believe those slogans left them unusually vulnerable to Republican attacks. But this is a textbook case of assuming one thing caused the other because they followed in chronological order. Perhaps Democrats slipped because they were associated with “defund the police” or perhaps — as Democrats as different as Doug Jones, Beto O’Rourke and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have suggested — it had something to do with poor campaign infrastructure and a message that was unresponsive to the electorate.
The problem with the second narrative — Republicans have built a new working-class, multiracial coalition — is that it takes Trump out of the context of past election results. If preliminary exit polls are any indication — and they have real flaws as measurement tools — Trump did hardly any better with Black voters than George W. Bush in 2004 and quite a bit worse with Hispanic voters. Far from a seismic shift, Trump, with 32% support among Hispanics (a four-point upswing from his first run) is doing about as well as John McCain did in 2008.
But even as we throw cold water on these narratives — at least until there’s more evidence to back them up — we’re still left with the unanswered question of how Trump performed as well as he did. He may not have transformed the Republican coalition, but he held onto much of his 2016 support and even enlarged it, if not in percentage terms then in absolute ones. Democrats who thought he would be swamped by high turnout were wrong; not only did he benefit, but his ability to turn nonvoters into voters is what likely kept him in the game.
At the risk of committing the same sin as other observers and getting ahead of the data, I want to propose an alternative explanation for the election results, one that accounts for the president’s relative improvement as well as that of the entire Republican Party.
It’s the money, stupid.
At the end of March, Trump signed the CARES Act, which distributed more than half a trillion dollars in direct aid to more than 150 million Americans, from stimulus checks ($1,200 per adult and $500 per child for households below a certain income threshold) to $600 per week in additional unemployment benefits. These programs were not perfect — the supplement unemployment insurance, in particular, depended on ramshackle state systems, forcing many applicants to wait weeks or even months before they received assistance — but they made an impact regardless. Personal income went up and poverty went down, even as the United States reported its steepest ever quarterly drop in economic output.
Now, the reason this many Americans received as much assistance as they did is that Democrats fought for it over the opposition of Republicans who believed any help beyond the minimum would degrade the will to work for whatever wage employers were willing to pay. “The moment we go back to work, we cannot create an incentive for people to say, ‘I don’t need to go back to work because I can do better someplace else,’” Sen. Rick Scott of Florida argued on the floor of the Senate.
But voters, and especially the low-propensity voters who flooded the electorate in support of Trump, aren’t attuned to the ins and outs of congressional debate. They did not know — and Democrats didn’t do a good enough job of telling them — that the president and his party opposed more generous benefits. All they knew is that Trump signed the bill (and the checks), giving them the kind of government assistance usually reserved for the nation’s ownership class.
Nearly everything in politics has multiple explanations, and there are many factors that can and do explain the election results. But I would not ignore the extent to which the Republican Party’s strong performance can be explained simply by the fact that it was the party in power when the government put a lot of money into the hands of a lot of people who didn’t have it before.
The upshot of this, for the incoming Biden administration, is straightforward: Do not listen to the debt worriers and the deficit hawks. Ignore the calls for means-testing and complicated workarounds. Embrace, instead, the simplicity of cash. Take a page from the left and give as much direct help to as many people as possible.
The concentration of its coalition in cities and suburbs is such that the Democratic Party faces a number of structural obstacles to winning and wielding power. There’s no easy solution to this problem, but there are ways to make the path less difficult. And one of them is as straightforward as cutting a check when there’s a national crisis and keeping it going for those who need it when there isn’t.

François Catroux, a glamorous designer for the Rothschild family, Russian oligarchs, Greek and Arab princesses, fashion designers, media moguls and South American billionaires — what used to be known as the jet set — died on Nov. 8 in a hospital in Paris. He was 83.
The cause was a brain tumor, said his wife, Betty Catroux.
François Catroux was movie-star handsome with a perennial tan and a taste for expensive sports cars, the grandson of a noted French general and a Spanish heiress, and a high school friend of Yves Saint Laurent. Along with his wife, Betty Catroux, the lanky androgyne beauty who was Saint Laurent’s muse and playmate, the Algerian-born François Catroux was at the center of Paris’ glittering 1970s-era social scene, a complicated fantasia at which art, fashion and money collided.
Catroux was self-taught, with a sophisticated eye, and his first design job, when he was 30, was for Mila Schön, a stalwart of Italian fashion, who in 1967 asked him to design her showroom in a Milanese palazzo.
He turned it into a white laminate spaceship, Stanley Kubrick by way of Eero Saarinen, “a futuristic, minimalistic theater in the round for fashion — exactly right for the times,” wrote David Netto, the interior designer and writer, in his 2016 monograph about Catroux, “delivered by an ingénue and it caused a sensation in the design world.”
“It looks like tomorrow,” Eugenia Sheppard, the syndicated fashion and society columnist, wrote in 1970, “all space and no furniture.”
So did the apartment he shared with Betty Catroux on the Quai de Béthune, a neo-futuristic playground made from vinyl, leather, plexiglass and steel, and photographed by Horst P. Horst for Vogue, with the couple dressed, rather terrifyingly, in matching Saint Laurent khaki, and sprawled on a vinyl banquette.
“My apartment happened during the French revolutionary year of 1968,” he told Netto, “when everyone was against everything — and without knowing it myself, I was against everything too. Against things , so for two years I thought only of volumes and levels, without any furniture … cushions instead of a sofa, a cube for a coffee table …”
“It was a boule de neige — it snowballed from there,” Catroux told James Reginato of Vanity Fair. “Voilà, my career started.”
François Philippe Frédéric Catroux was born on Dec. 5, 1936, in Mascara, in northern Algeria. His grandfather, George Catroux, was a French general and diplomat who joined Charles de Gaulle in the Free French movement and later served as a governor general of Algeria and minister for North Africa. His father, André, managed the family’s properties in Mascara, which included a vineyard. His mother, Alphonsine Mallet, who was known as Sinette, was a homemaker.
Describing his family as “grand bourgeois,” their tastes, as their son said later, ran to lots of fake Louis XI furniture that he was already irritated by at age 5. At a Catholic boarding school in Oran, Algeria, François met Yves Saint Laurent, a day student, who was bullied by their classmates. When they met later in Paris, as Catroux told Netto, they never spoke of their days at school together.
After serving in the French army, Catroux worked as a location scout for Elle magazine, and in 1963 Catroux spent six months in New York City, where he met decorator Billy Baldwin, composer Cole Porter (whom he did not like, though he approved of his Waldorf Towers apartment), architect Philip Johnson (who invited him to spend weekends at his Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut), socialite Babe Paley and other midcentury society figures.
A decade later, he would return to Manhattan to work on apartments in Olympic Tower on Fifth Avenue, then a brand-new glassy high rise, for a Chilean tin baron named Antenor Patiño, and for Helene Rochas, the French couturier.
Back home in France, Catroux would design a lodge for Baroness Marie-Hélène de Rothschild, a friend, on the grounds of her chateau outside Paris, as well as portions of the family’s Hôtel Lambert, mixing the storied Rothschild collections — the Dutch master paintings, 17th-century tapestries and 18th-century furniture — with his own modernist tastes.
For a television room, he sliced up 17th-century Verdure tapestries and upholstered the floors and lozenge-shaped mod ’70s sectional sofas with them.
Catroux’s clients were generational: The children of billionaires who had grown up in his houses in Paris, Greece or South America tended to hire him when they had their own. Catroux was still working — on a hotel in Cartagena, Colombia, among other international projects — when he learned he had cancer a few years ago.
“He looked like this Riviera playboy,” said Madison Cox, the garden designer and widower of Pierre Bergé, Saint Laurent’s partner, “but he was also extremely hardworking. He was able to project that kind of ease that comforted his clients. He had an innate sense of true luxury and well-made things and he worked for people who strove for that and he knew exactly how to produce it.”
For Diane von Furstenberg, a friend of five decades, and her husband, Barry Diller, he designed houses in Los Angeles and Connecticut, as well as their megayacht, Eos.
“He had that military side, so things were very precise and symmetrical. He liked things in pairs,” von Furstenberg said in a phone interview, “but everything was very cozy, too, that very grand coziness which was never pretentious, a luxury just for you, not to show off.”
In addition to his wife, Catroux is survived by their daughters, Maxime and Daphné, and two grandchildren.
He met Betty Catroux at a nightclub in Paris, when she had the bartender send him a drink; she met Saint Laurent the same way, though it was the designer who sent her a drink. She often said she was very clever in managing both men.
While for decades Betty Catroux and Saint Laurent careened in and out of trouble — their shared benders and stints in rehabs were renowned — François Catroux was at work every day, bright and early.
“The truth is, it was a huge love affair,” said Netto. “She was this mysterious person who could not be captured and he was perfect for her because he didn’t need that from her. I think he just adored her cat power. He was devoted to her and she set the terms.”
“They were like Adam and Eve,” said Cox, “the eternal couple.
“I knew she was the one for me immediately,” François Catroux told Reginato of Vanity Fair in 2016. “If I missed this one, there was nobody else. I couldn’t miss this one. We’ve been together for 50 years. No regrets. But she’s not something … normal. She’s a special case.”
Betty Catroux would agree.
“I’m not interested in fashion and I’m not interested in design and I got the two geniuses on the subject,” she said in a phone interview. “I could live in an empty room as long as there was a bottle of wine and good music. But I know what’s beautiful. I was so lucky. It’s been a fairy tale life.”

Photographer Chi Modu was working for The Amsterdam News in 1991 and looking for freelance work. A fan of hip-hop acts like Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys and LL Cool J, he stopped by the offices of The Source, the small magazine that would become the most important rap outlet of the decade.
Modu soon found himself at work connecting with artists who oftentimes, at that point, were all but unknown. They would later become some of the most recognizable entertainers in the world.
The photographer, now 54, said that even back then, he was thinking in historical terms.
“I’m a documentarian,” he said. “As a documentarian, you really want people to be able to look at your photographs and see what was going on.”
Thirty years later, Modu’s pictures of Tupac Shakur, the Notorious B.I.G., Snoop Dogg, Wu-Tang Clan and others make up the foundational images of that era, in which rap went from a subculture to American entertainment’s dominant aesthetic. His portraits — of a stoic Biggie framed by the World Trade Center, of a shirtless Shakur staring at the camera — are indelible.
This fall, Modu has reaped the benefits of his work from the ’90s. In September, Sotheby’s sold eight of his photos at auction, among them the picture of Biggie in front of the towers, which brought in $30,240, and a portrait of Eazy-E that sold for $12,600.
And on Thursday, copies of Modu’s images of Shakur and Biggie will be available for purchase knitted into the fabric of 300 limited-edition luxury sweatshirts conceived by designer David Helwani. The images are not screen prints but meticulous recreations of the originals in seven shades of yarn.
In partnership with Modu, Helwani will release 75 pullover sweatshirts ($395 apiece) and 75 hoodies ($495 apiece) featuring each image. The 300 garments will be available for purchase at a “virtual gallery” Helwani will host on his website.
“I wanted this whole project to be treated as an art project,” said Helwani, who recognized Modu on the street in SoHo in January 2018 and pitched him on the spot.
In the early 1990s, Modu’s collaborators at The Source couldn’t have known that his photographs would someday become luxury items. The magazine was small, and its staff was working in a media environment that was unfriendly to the culture it championed.
But partly because The Source was one of few outlets covering the genre seriously, it became a one-stop shop for the artists and those who cared about them. Its staff forged close relationships with rappers who went on to be world famous. In some instances, the magazine played a key role in artists’ careers, bringing them to the attention of labels through its Unsigned Hype column.
“The Source was everything back then,” said Havoc, one half of the Queensbridge duo Mobb Deep. “You wanted to be in The Source because everybody looked at it.”
Along with his work for the magazine, Modu also shot album covers, including that of Mobb Deep’s 1995 record, “The Infamous.” The shoot was characteristic of Modu’s exhaustive approach.
“I was getting tired,” Havoc said. “But he kept on trying to do different scenarios, and I thank him for that, looking back on it now. Because the actual cover of ‘The Infamous’ album to me, in my mind, it matches the content. We dealt with photographers before that. But with Chi, it just felt different because it felt like he cared.”
Modu said that some of that trust came because his subjects understood how his life might intersect with theirs.
“I’m not from the hood, but they’re my people, so I feel right at home,” he said. “I’m looking at a young Black man, out here writing lyrics that are driven by his experiences in America, of which I am as well. Our experiences may be parallel, at times intertwining.”
Modu’s photography introduced his subjects to an American youth that had been told that rappers were to be feared. Lawrence Ware, a co-director of the Africana Studies program at Oklahoma State University said that the pictures provided a much-needed counternarrative.
“The mainstream media at the time was painting these guys as kind of evil,” Ware said. “They’re scary, they’re damaging, they’re dangerous. The Source — and really Chi’s photography — did a good job of showing them as everyday people.”
For some, the increasing value of hip-hop artifacts can feel somewhat uncomfortable. After all, this was grassroots music, built from the bottom up. Modu acknowledged that ethos and said he strove to ensure his work was available to the public at various price points.
“Yes, I can have a piece move at an auction at Sotheby’s, but I will also sell you a $20 poster or a $1 postcard or a $2 greeting card or a $60 skateboard, because for some people, that’s all they can afford,” he said. “And they shouldn’t be denied the work.”
Cassandra Hatton, a vice president at Sotheby’s who curated the auction at which Modu’s photographs sold, said that it was important to her that the people who created the culture were rewarded for their contributions.
“I’d rather the artists, many of whom did not make a lot of money back in the day, I’d rather they make the money now,” she said. “I’d rather they get the recognition that they deserve.”
After all, collectibles from rock ’n’ roll’s reign were long ago recognized for their value. Hatton said that there was no reason hip-hop should be any different.
“Why not?” she said. “Why not have this stuff be worth more than rock ’n’ roll?”

WASHINGTON — In the final weeks of President Donald Trump’s term, his administration intends to execute three inmates on federal death row, the last scheduled executions by the Justice Department before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has signaled he will end federal use of capital punishment.
Since July, when it resumed carrying out the death penalty after a 17-year hiatus, the Trump administration has executed seven federal inmates. Weeks before Biden is sworn in, the three inmates face the prospect of being the last federal prisoners to die by capital punishment for at least as long as he remains in office.
Orlando Cordia Hall, 49, convicted in the brutal death of a teenage girl, is scheduled to be executed Thursday. Two others prisoners are to be executed in December, including Lisa M. Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row.
Biden has pledged to eliminate the death penalty. His campaign promised to work to pass legislation to end capital punishment on the federal level and incentivize states to follow suit. An aide reiterated Biden’s platform when asked how he planned to do so and did not respond to requests for comment on the scheduled executions.
The Justice Department under Trump resumed federal capital punishment this summer after a nearly two-decade-long informal moratorium. Before then, only three people had been executed by the federal government in the past 50 years, according to Bureau of Prisons data.
Biden came under criticism during the Democratic primary campaign for his role in passing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Among other provisions, the bill expanded the crimes eligible for the federal death penalty.
Like most of those on federal death row, the three inmates awaiting execution were all convicted under a part of the violent crime bill known as the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, according to Robert C. Owen, a lawyer representing two of those scheduled for execution. Hall was among the first people sentenced to death under the law.
The three inmates all have litigation in the works that seeks to halt their executions, although it is unclear how receptive the Supreme Court might be to their pleas, especially with the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett last month. In July, she was on a panel of judges on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed the first federal execution in nearly two decades to proceed.
Even before Barrett’s confirmation, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has been unreceptive this year to requests to delay the executions.
Federal executions during a transition of power are extremely unusual, according to Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. He said that presidents have generally deferred to the incoming administration.
“This is another part of the Trump legacy that’s inconsistent with American norms,” he said. “If the administration followed the normal rules of civility that have been followed throughout the history in this country, it wouldn’t be an issue. The executions wouldn’t go forward.”
The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment about the timing of the executions.
Each of three inmates, who are to be put to death by lethal injection at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, was implicated in a gruesome crime. Hall was convicted of “kidnapping resulting in death,” among other offenses, after he and several accomplices who ran a marijuana trafficking operation kidnapped, raped and buried alive a 16-year-old girl in 1994, according to the Justice Department.
Brandon Bernard, 40, was among a group that murdered two youth ministers on the Fort Hood military reservation in 1999, the Justice Department said. The federal government executed one of his accomplices in the case, Christopher Vialva, in September. Bernard was 18 at the time of the crimes.
The government also plans to execute Montgomery, 52, who would be the first woman to be executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. She was convicted of kidnapping resulting in death in 2007, after she strangled a pregnant woman and abducted the unborn child, the Justice Department said.
Lawyers for Montgomery said she was a victim of sex trafficking and sexual abuse as a child. She suffers from bipolar disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder in addition to hallucinations, psychosis, mania and depression, according to a court filing from her lawyers.
Owen, who represents Hall and Bernard, said he had not seen either of his clients in prison for some time because of the coronavirus pandemic. He said the prisoners scheduled for execution were “essentially randomly selected offenders.”
Owen also noted that Americans had voted for Biden, a candidate who has openly expressed opposition to federal capital punishment, and argued that these executions a few weeks before his inauguration would be “an arbitrary, unjust tragedy.”
“How can we be killing people between now and January?” he said. “Those people are in effect caught in an eddy of history. They are being swirled around in an eddy that does not represent the main flow of American political opinion and social judgment about the death penalty.”
One of Montgomery’s lawyers, Kelley Henry, said her client was being held in the worst conditions she had seen in 30 years of capital litigation.
For the first two weeks after the warrant was issued for her execution, Montgomery was forced to wear an anti-suicide smock without underwear and expose herself to potential onlookers, including men, when she used the restroom, Henry said. Montgomery spoke of night terrors of being raped, and a male guard told her that he had seen her use the restroom, a remark intended to underscore that he had seen her naked, Henry said.
“Even in Guantánamo Bay, when the men use the bathroom, they get a privacy shield,” she said. Montgomery, who is currently held at a federal medical center in Fort Worth, Texas, did not use the restroom for a week at one point, Henry said, but she has since been provided mesh underwear. The Bureau of Prisons said it would not comment on pending litigation or matters that are the subject of legal proceedings.
Henry and another lawyer representing Montgomery both received COVID diagnoses shortly after visiting their client.
Several other lawyers represented Montgomery in a new lawsuit filed Nov. 12 to delay her execution, arguing that she would not have sufficient access to her long-standing counsel during the clemency process in light of their COVID diagnoses.
Diane Mattingly, 57, Montgomery’s half sister, said the decision about Montgomery’s execution should be delayed for the incoming administration. Mattingly said she was praying that someone on the court would issue a stay until the new administration.
“But if we can’t have that, I’m begging Trump to open up his heart and see the damage and the terror that this woman has endured her whole life,” she said. “I’m like, ‘Why now? Why are they doing this now?’”

A manhunt was underway in Colorado on Wednesday after authorities recently discovered the skeletal remains of three people near a tiny rural town near the New Mexico border.
A warrant for homicide was issued for Adre Jordan Baroz, 26, after investigators said they had found the remains on two properties near Los Sauces, in Conejos County, Colorado.
The authorities did not say how they had connected Baroz to the remains but said that people in the community know Baroz by his nickname, Psycho.
Law enforcement agents warned that he was dangerous and said that the discovery of the remains had deeply unsettled people in the county, which is home to about 8,000 residents, many of them farmers and ranchers
“Obviously, we don’t see cases like this very often,” Ken Anderson, the chief of police in Alamosa, Colorado, said at a virtual news conference Wednesday with officials from several other local law enforcement agencies as well as the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.
“It’s a very tight-knit community,” Anderson said. “We really know a lot of people here. Most of us have grown up here. So now we’re at a point that it is imperative that we get this individual off the street. When I say he’s a danger to the community, I mean exactly that — he’s a danger.”
Officials said they had discovered the first skeletal remains Nov. 10 after they went to a property near Los Sauces to execute a search warrant for stolen vehicles and equipment. The discovery led them to more remains on a nearby property, on Nov. 13.
Officials declined to describe the properties but said they were not owned by Baroz, who is from nearby Sanford, Colorado.
George Dingfelder, the chief of police in Monte Vista, Colorado, said that a forensic anthropologist had confirmed that the remains were human. But the authorities said they did not know how the people had died, how old they were, their gender or how long the remains had been on the properties.
Dingfelder said it could takes weeks or months to identify the victims.
The authorities declined to describe the evidence that led them to obtain a warrant for Baroz’s arrest. But law enforcement officials said they had set up a hotline to collect tips and had formed a task force to help investigate the case.
“Our department is just not big enough to handle what we were running into,” Garth Crowther, the Conejos County sheriff, said at the news conference. He said the discovery of the remains was “kind of a shock here.”
People are “concerned about it,” Crowther said. “They need to be cautious and be careful.”
Los Sauces is home to about 25 people and has no businesses and only one road leading to it, according to Larry Crowder, the state senator who represents the area. “It’s a small farming community, very tight knit,” he said.
LeRoy Martinez, 81, a farmer and rancher who was born in Los Sauces and whose brother still lives there, described the community as a “beautiful little place.” But he said some of the grandchildren of the longtime families there had brought “bad vibes.”
He said he didn’t know Baroz but said his family members work as builders and contractors in the area.
“Never seen this Psycho — don’t know about anything him,” Martinez said. “I’m sure they will find him. It’s just a matter of when.”
The manhunt was focused on Southern Colorado but could expand, depending on the investigation, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.
Dingfelder emphasized that the remains were not necessarily connected to a number of cases of missing people in the San Luis Valley.
“Just because human remains have been found, we are not associating them with the missing persons cases at this time,” he said, “and for anybody to do so would be irresponsible and complete speculation.”

WASHINGTON — One day after an announcement in 2018 that President Donald Trump’s former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman had written a negative tell-all memoir, the White House asked the Justice Department to open an investigation into a seemingly unrelated paperwork dispute that led to a government lawsuit against her, according to documents and interviews.
The Justice Department has taken aggressive legal actions against a number of former Trump aides who wrote unflattering memoirs, prompting accusations that administration officials were abusing their power over law enforcement to enact retribution.
The timing of the White House’s referral to the Justice Department of its dispute with Manigault Newman over a missing form suggests that the eventual lawsuit against her may be part of that pattern — even though the case, on its face, is not about her scathing August 2018 book, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House.”
“This was weaponization of a lawsuit by the White House for retaliation for writing a book — for saying offensive words about Mr. Trump,” said John Phillips, a lawyer for Manigault Newman.
The Justice Department said that career lawyers who were assigned to investigate the form dispute recommended filing a lawsuit based on the facts. The White House declined to comment about whether the book influenced its decision to escalate the dispute by referring the matter to the department for such scrutiny.
Senior Justice Department officials referred both to Manigault Newman and to communications with the White House the day after her book announcement, according to a log of their emails that the department produced and provided to The New York Times in response to a pending Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
Manigault Newman is a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” Trump’s reality television show, and worked for his 2016 campaign, taking a White House job after his election. But the two later had a falling-out. In late 2017, Trump’s chief of staff at the time, John F. Kelly, fired her — in a conversation she secretly taped — and she was escorted out without packing up her office.
After her termination, Manigault Newman was required, under a provision of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, to file a report disclosing certain financial and travel matters. But she told the White House that she could not fill it out until she received boxes of files from her former office containing tax and travel records; the White House was slow to give them to her.
As a back-and-forth played out, news of Manigault Newman’s memoir emerged July 26, 2018, alarming Trump. A presale announcement that day promised a “jaw dropping” takedown and a tell-all about the “corruption and controversy” of the Trump administration to be published the next month, attracting news media attention.
The next day, July 27, according to the Justice Department log, two email chains began “regarding authorization to communicate with the Office of the White House Counsel and discussing options for whether a lawsuit should be filed or not.”
That was the date the White House made the referral to the Justice Department, beginning its inquiry, said a department official whom its press office provided for an interview about the matter on the condition of anonymity.
None of the materials the White House sent to the department made any reference to Manigault Newman’s book, the official added. But the official also noted that the department did not know what was in the minds of Trump’s aides when they decided to make the referral.
That August, the book was published. It portrayed Trump as a bigot and a misogynist who was in mental decline. The Trump campaign swiftly filed an arbitration action against Manigault Newman for purportedly violating a nondisclosure agreement. It is not yet resolved.
Meanwhile, negotiations between the Justice Department and Manigault Newman over the unreturned form and the unreturned files dragged into 2019.
Several legal experts said the Justice Department receives several referrals a year from agencies having trouble getting ex-employees to fill out required exit paperwork, and such disputes usually end with a settlement of several hundred to several thousand dollars. At no point, Phillips said, has the department made a settlement offer to Manigault Newman.
In June 2019, the department instead sued Manigault Newman, seeking a fine of “up to $50,000.” The next month, Phillips said, the White House finally handed over her files, and she has since filled out the form, although a dispute remains about whether her work was adequate.
Jody Hunt, who led the Justice Department’s Civil Division at the time the lawsuit was filed but has since left government, said the department’s decision to go to court was “a routine matter based upon the recommendation of career attorneys and had nothing to do with her book.”
Phillips has argued that Manigault Newman did not intentionally fail to turn in the form — a necessary element — because the White House was holding onto files she needed to do so. The department has not accepted the idea that access to those files was necessary.
The Justice Department in the Trump era has also acted against other onetime members of Trump’s circle who wrote critical memoirs.
In June, the department asked a judge to order Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton to pull back his book, “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” which presents a negative account of Trump.
The request to enjoin the book was extraordinary as a matter of First Amendment law and because copies were already printed and distributed. The judge refused to grant that order but is still weighing the department’s request to seize Bolton’s $2 million advance in a dispute over the prepublication review process, which is meant to screen out classified information.
In July, another judge ruled that department officials had engaged in retaliation against Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, who was about to publish “Disloyal: A Memoir,” which portrays the president as a sordid, mafialike figure.
Cohen was serving a prison sentence at home because of the coronavirus pandemic, but officials had ordered him returned to prison when he refused their demand that he sign a document barring him from publishing his then-forthcoming book.
And in October, the department sued Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a onetime friend and aide to Melania Trump, over her book, “Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship With the First Lady,” which presents Melania Trump as selfish and shallow. The memoir contains no classified information, but the department accused Winston Wolkoff of violating a nondisclosure agreement.
Phillips said he would seek to depose officials and obtain the contents of emails to figure out the motivation behind White House officials’ decision to refer the dispute over Manigault Newman’s form to the Justice Department immediately after they learned of her book.
“This doesn’t just reek of retaliation; it is fairly provable to be retaliation, which violates the First Amendment,” he said.

NEW YORK — Archie Spigner, a New York City councilman who was a political kingmaker in southeast Queens for a half-century, helping fellow Black politicians climb the ladder and coaxing jobs and construction projects into his district, died Oct. 29 in, of course, Queens. He was 92.
His wife, Leslie Spigner, said the cause was cancer. He died at Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
Spigner represented his home base on the City Council from 1974 to 2001, the last 15 of those years as the deputy to the majority leader, Peter Vallone. But in his district he was nobody’s second in command. For 50 years — from 1970 until his death — Spigner ran the United Democratic Club of Queens and served as a district leader, positions that gave him power to help shape the Democratic Party’s local leadership.
In an area that reliably voted Democratic, a nod from Spigner all but assured election. As Donnie Whitehead, a local campaign manager, put it, Spigner’s blessing was as essential to a candidate in southeast Queens as Christ’s was to a Christian hoping to gain entry to heaven.
In 2009, managing a rival campaign in a Democratic primary, Whitehead had vowed to change that. “No more only getting elected through Archie,” he declared.
Once again, Spigner’s candidate won.
“He was the godfather of politics in southeastern Queens,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the area’s House member.
Spigner oversaw Meeks’ rise along with those of many other Black leaders from Queens, including Kenneth Browne, the borough’s first Black member of the New York state Assembly and its first Black state Supreme Court justice; Andrew Jenkins, its first Black state senator; and Alton Waldon Jr., its first Black representative in Congress.
His influence extended to any Democrat, of any race, running in his area. At Spigner’s funeral, Sen. Chuck Schumer attributed his own 1998 Senate victory in part to Spigner’s support.
As a local-minded city councilman, Spigner helped shepherd the sale of the oft-criticized Jamaica Water Supply Co., New York City’s last privately owned waterworks, to the city government in 1997, bringing down costs for residents of southeast Queens. To spur local business, he successfully pushed for the construction of a permanent building for York College, part of the City University of New York, in the Jamaica section of Queens; a subway extension to downtown Jamaica; and a regional headquarters of the Social Security Administration.
But some who sought to change the status quo in city politics saw a downside to Spigner’s clout and successful promotion of pet projects.
“He got all of that by never causing any problems for the leadership,” said Ronnie Eldridge, who served with Spigner on the City Council. “He was not open to any great reforms.”
Preservationists used Spigner’s name as a verb to signify opposition to designating buildings as landmarks. On several occasions he thwarted attempts to protect New York’s single-room-occupancy hotels.
The website of the Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit group, describes the loss of those units as “the most significant single change in New York City’s housing stock during the emergence of modern homelessness.”
SRO policy was one of several issues on which Eldridge opposed Spigner. Yet she fondly recalled socializing with him when she was an executive of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in the 1970s and ’80s.
“Every time the Port Authority had a party, Archie was there,” Eldridge said, adding, “Archie was just a very affable man.”
Archie Hugo Spigner was born Aug. 27, 1928, in Orangeburg, South Carolina, to Walter and Estelle (Kitt) Spigner. His father was a house painter, his mother a church volunteer. His family moved to New York when Archie was 7, and he grew up in Harlem.
From the start he had Black political mentors. As a young bus driver engaged in union activism, Spigner drew the attention of labor leader A. Philip Randolph. Spigner was charged with forming a Queens branch of Randolph’s Negro American Labor Council.
While looking for a meeting place for his group, Spigner met Browne, who was running for the state Assembly. Browne took Spigner to the local Democratic club and introduced him to district leader Guy Brewer.
Spigner would become an essential operative for both men as they blazed a path for Black candidates in Queens politics. Brewer was also elected an assemblyman, and when he stepped down as district leader, he anointed Spigner his successor.
At Brewer’s urging, Spigner attended college, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in political science from Queens College in 1972.
In 1974, however, the two men became rivals when both sought the City Council seat representing southeast Queens. The local club held a secret ballot to resolve the dispute, and Spigner won by a single vote. He stayed on the council until 2001, when the introduction of term limits forced him out.
Spigner’s first marriage, to Christine Townsend, ended with her death in 2007. In addition to Leslie Spigner, his second wife, he is survived by a son from his first marriage, Philip; a grandson; and two great-granddaughters.
Even though he ran the Democratic clubhouse, in the St. Albans section of Queens, Spigner did not treat it as a personal fief and went about his business without fanfare. His office was a little-used room in the back, and rather than frequenting expensive steakhouses, he held morning meetings in Queens diners.
“He wasn't big on trying to drain anybody’s pockets to get a $100 dinner,” said Leroy Comrie, a state senator and one of Spigner’s many protégés. “He just wanted to deal with the issue.”
