Texto completo: Perhaps you have heard that we have only 12 years to get climate change under control, or else. Or else what? That is not exactly clear, but it will be expensive, deadly, and bad, though not, in any meaningful sense of the word, apocalyptic. The latest big summary from the U.N. body of scientists and researchers tasked with looking into the issue, the Fifth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is foreboding. In its Summary for Policymakers about what a world that has passed the (arbitrary) mark of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming looks like, it says things such as: “Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes have been detected over time spans during which about 0.5°C of global warming occurred (medium confidence). This assessment is based on several lines of evidence, including attribution studies for changes in extremes since 1950.”
Its careful scientific wording makes me believe climate change is real and that it’s anthropogenic, or human-caused.
Let’s just say that if greenhouse gas mitigation strategies prove prohibitively expensive, and they do, I think we should be exploring some technological alternatives. It does not make me want to get a sandwich board and go screaming on the nearest corner that the end is nigh.
In this way I seem to agree with the IPCC panelists, but I seem to disagree quite severely with the top editorship at the Guardian. On May 17, the Guardian's environment editor wrote: "The Guardian has updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world.
"Instead of 'climate change' the preferred terms are 'climate emergency, crisis or breakdown' and 'global heating' is favoured over 'global warming', although the original terms are not banned.”
Editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner said, “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. ... The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.” In a later article, the Guardian proudly reports being the tip of the spear, saying that at Canadian Broadcasting Corporation there has been a policy change. And referring to places including the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times, it notes that "journalists at several UK and US media outlets [are] reporting internal conversations about the language used around climate."
If the old terms are somehow failing to take the full measure of what faces the planet, then the IPCC is too. Search the whole IPCC report for “climate emergency,” “climate crisis,” or “climate breakdown.” You will not find them. You will find the now-not-O.K. terms. And anyway, “global heating” is an odd choice. Roget’s Thesaurus lists heating and warming as direct synonyms.
Finally, the Guardian now instructs “stylish” writers to prefer “climate science denialist” over “climate skeptic.” Look, if the description isn’t factual or accurate in some case, by all means, it should be changed. But it just isn’t a matter of style or syntax. I try very hard in this space not to constantly invoke George Orwell, but the political idea behind newspeak in 1984 is that the totalitarian believes that if there is no available word for a concept, then the reality of the concept will cease to exist. Orwell’s view was that this is (A) wrong, and (B) in attempting it, the censors will try to destroy much of what is deep and bright and human about our world, in which language is all we have to communicate with one another. So for a word-lover, the increasingly common impulse the Guardian is exhibiting represents an urgent crisis. We need to tackle it now, and every day matters.

Texto completo: Oh yeah, the Finals.
The NBA season is supposed to lead dramatically to this point but was widely believed to be over before it started with the Warriors coming off three titles in four seasons … having lost the one in 2016 after leading the Cavaliers 3-1… with no LeBron James-led contender arising in the East to worry about.
Instead, it’s the Toronto Raptors with their star/upcoming free agent, Kawhi Leonard, and trash-talking rapper/co-owner, Drake, representing the East and, in an upset, taking a 1-0 lead.
Unfortunately, Leonard played hurt last series as his uncle/adviser, Dennis Robertson, told Yahoo’s Chris Haynes (“You could clearly see he was in pain.”)
Nor did Kawhi look too bouncy in Game 1, scoring 23 points and shooting 5 for 14 from the field.
So, lead or no lead, good luck, Raptors!
The matchup looked so one-sided, Warriors players were being asked before it started if Steph Curry would finally be the Finals MVP … based, of course, on the assumption that injured Kevin Durant won’t be a major factor and that wouldn’t matter to the team.
Meanwhile, the New York Times’ Marc Stein introduced his plan for the anticipated walkover: multiple postseason tournaments like European soccer teams.
Compounding the absurdity, Commissioner Adam Silver told Stein that a second “cup” was “in the conceptual phase.”
As if the league needs a new attraction with a boffo comedy going as Magic Johnson continued to bash the Lakers while pledging undying love to them?
It was another crazy week with ESPN.com’s Baxter Holmes producing a 6,500-word opus on Johnson’s misbegotten era … while ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith melted down on the air, decrying his own company’s story.
Smith is Magic’s guy at The Wide World of Sports. As Stephen A. actually noted, he was embarrassed to have Johnson coming in the same day Holmes’ piece ran, in which Magic was alleged to be an abusive boss who had several Lakers staffers resigning and/or taking anti-anxiety medication.
Ranted Stephen A. in Johnson’s defense:
“Oh my god! Let’s get the ax! Let’s take Magic Johnson to the guillotine!”
Of course, with Johnson determined to keep going on the air to defend himself, these coincidences in timing are becoming common … like the week before when Magic went on to call GM Rob Pelinka a back-stabber, the same day the Lakers introduced Coach Frank Vogel in their first press conference since Johnson’s resignation 41 days before.
In the part we didn’t know before, Holmes reported James’ agent, Rich Paul, waged a season-long campaign against Coach Luke Walton.
This was confirmed by Silver, himself. In an early-season chance meeting, the commissioner said Paul told him something to the effect of, “Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.”
Assuming that Paul’s opinions followed James’, and Johnson’s followed LeBron’s, this explains why Magic went off on Walton at the seven-game mark, turning Luke into a lame duck.
LeBron knows he’s held to the highest standards and has done this before, trying and failing to get Erik Spoelstra fired in Miami, succeeding in getting David Blatt fired in Cleveland.
In this, James was joined by Johnson, feeling exposed after his controversial decisions to forego shooters and sign eccentrics such as JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley.
Not that Magic was supposed to take orders from James. With LeBron locked up for three seasons, it was the other way around.
It was Johnson’s job to make James understand they might have to sacrifice this season to finish rebuilding after saving a maximum salary slot and bringing in so many veterans on one-year deals.
What Magic wasn’t supposed to do was go off on Walton before Thanksgiving on LeBron’s behalf, undercutting what little stability they had.
Of course, conveying that message meant realizing it, himself. By all accounts, Magic didn’t, talking of building for the future while challenging Golden State at the same time.
A Lakers staffer told Holmes he didn’t know if Johnson had a plan. Actually, Magic did … or LeBron did … and it was a dilly: Trade for Anthony Davis, off-loading enough salary to save their max slot for another star free agent to put alongside James.
Unfortunately for Magic, it proved impossible with New Orleans blaming the Lakers for their heavy-handed, obviously LeBron-driven, wooing of A.D.
Worst of all for Johnson, he wasn’t working at the Lakers job full-time and couldn’t live it down when it got into the press.
“And last but not least, lazy?” Magic told Stephen A. last week, re-framing the charge into one he could lampoon.
“I have built a $600 million business. You can not be lazy going from basketball and winning five championships. … I wasn’t lazy as a player and I’m not lazy as a CEO and a business owner. That’s never going to happen.”
Of course, no one said he was lazy. The charge was that he wasn’t often in the Lakers’ office, which he hasn’t addressed.
Holmes, noting Johnson’s many business interests, suggests he was in their office “once a week or every two weeks.”
Infrequent as that was, it could have been OK if Johnson had a smooth working relationship with an experienced No. 2 man who assigned all the detail work.
Imagine if Jeanie Buss had kept GM Mitch Kupchak, who had all the qualifications, instead of lumping Mitch in with her brother, Jim, when she fired him.
The No. 2 man became Pelinka, an agent, hired at the suggestion of his client, Kobe Bryant, neither of whom had front office experience.
As for Johnson’s inconceivable charge of being stabbed in the back … still unspecified aside from citing “little things that bothered me” … he had more than two seasons with Pelinka. If loyalty was an issue, Magic should have been able to tell long before.
Unfortunately for the Lakers and Jeanie, who kept Pelinka, Rob is now lumped in with Johnson in the press, as if he was Magic’s partner in crime … setting up Pelinka as the scapegoat for the next thing that goes wrong.
Actually, Pelinka looks more like another of the staffers Magic ran roughshod over.
Pelinka, reported Holmes, survived with the avid support of Jeanie’s best friend and new Lakers power player, Linda Rambis.
Now to see how long any of them, Rob and/or Linda, last.
If there’s a silver lining for Lakers fans, it’s that the heat in the press is exposing an organization run on nepotism and cronyism, which Jeanie might finally be obliged to recognize and professionalize.
Of course, that suggests more misadventures await in the meantime so buckle up.

HARVARD ENFEEBLES LIBERAL EDUCATION YET AGAIN THE UNIVERSITY FAVORS PROGRESSIVE AUTHORITARIANISM OVER TRADITIONAL LIBERAL VALUES

Texto completo: Harvard University's maladroit defenestration of Ronald Sullivan and his wife, Stephanie Robinson, struck a blow against liberal education. Many of Harvard's own left-liberal luminaries are up in arms. But the university's disgraceful act can come as no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention for the last few decades to higher education in general and to Harvard in particular.
On May 11, the Harvard Crimson reported that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana informed Winthrop House residents by email that morning that he would not renew Mr. Sullivan and Ms. Robinson - both of whom teach at Harvard Law School and will keep their positions there - as Winthrop faculty deans. The first African Americans to head one of Harvard's 12 residential houses, the couple had served in that position for 10 years.
*
The trouble began in January when Mr. Sullivan - faculty director of the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute and the Harvard Trial Advocacy Workshop - announced that he would serve on the legal team representing film producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces criminal charges of rape and other sexual misconduct (Mr. Sullivan left Mr. Weinstein's defense team the day before Mr. Khurana made public his decision). Students protested angrily. They claimed that Mr. Sullivan caused them to feel unsafe by taking Mr. Weinstein as a client. They alleged that Mr. Sullivan's decision was "trauma-inducing." They demanded his ouster on the grounds that he had rendered himself unfit to lead Winthrop House.
Mr. Sullivan emailed Winthrop House students to explain that it was the duty of defense lawyers in the American criminal justice system to represent those accused of crimes, including those who are unpopular. "It is particularly important for this category of unpopular defendant to receive the same process as everyone else," Mr. Sullivan wrote. "To the degree we deny unpopular defendants basic due process rights we cease to be the country we imagine ourselves to be."
To accommodate students who might be sincerely discomfited when confiding intimate details of abuse to one of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers, Mr. Sullivan announced the appointment of a special dean at Winthrop House to serve as a point person to whom students could report allegations of sexual misconduct.
Nevertheless, in March, Mr. Khurana initiated a "Winthrop House climate review." Earlier this month, with the investigation complete, Mr. Khurana wrote to Winthrop House students to inform them that he was compelled to terminate Mr. Sullivan and Ms. Robinson, because "students and staff have continued to communicate concerns about the climate in Winthrop House" that are "serious and numerous."
.
This should come as no surprise. For decades, Harvard has been sedulously creating a campus climate hostile to liberal education and its moral presuppositions. The university has long encouraged the belief that when the opinions or feelings of progressive students come into conflict with the imperatives of free speech, due process, rigorous inquiry, robust debate and independent thought, the essentials of liberal education must yield.
Several left-liberal Harvard Law School professors have testified to the gravity of Harvard's most recent betrayal of traditional liberal principles. Likening the firing of Mr. Sullivan and Ms. Robinson to the dismissal of lawyers who, in his student days, represented communists and civil rights activists, professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz wrote that "[f]eeling 'unsafe' is the new mantra for the new McCarthyism." According to Mr. Dershowitz, "Any student who feels unsafe in the presence of two distinguished lawyers doesn't belong at a university." In any event, the claim is not credible, he maintains, "since the students apparently did not feel 'unsafe' when Sullivan was representing a convicted double murderer."
In a New York Times op-ed, law professor Randall Kennedy asserted that in his 34 years at Harvard the university "has never so thoroughly embarrassed itself," lamenting that "Harvard College appears to have ratified the proposition that it is inappropriate for a faculty dean to defend a person reviled by a substantial number of students - a position that would disqualify a long list of stalwart defenders of civil liberties and civil rights, including Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall."
Harvard's renowned constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe tweeted, "Of the many blunders Harvard has made in my 50 years as a professor here, I recall none worse." Mr. Tribe joined a letter of condemnation signed by 52 members of the law school faculty.
Alas, Harvard's steady descent over many years into authoritarian progressivism and illiberal identity politics casts doubt on the ability of Harvard's administration to recognize the force of such a traditionally liberal stance and on the willingness of Harvard professors to back it.
In 2005, then-university President Lawrence Summers wondered at a private brainstorming session aimed at increasing the number of women faculty members in natural sciences and engineering whether biologically based differences between men and women could influence differences in their choices of profession and professional achievements. His remarks leaked. He apologized, but within months a groundswell of faculty wrath forced him to resign.
In 2010, Harvard Law School students distributed a classmate's email in which she had written that, before taking a position on connections between IQ and race, she would have to consult the scientific research. For wishing to examine the evidence before reaching a judgment, the student was shamed by fellow students. The law school dean at the time sided with those who sought to censor speech and regulate thought through public humiliation.
Plenty of other lamentable episodes could be added.
Harvard's decision to discharge Ronald Sullivan and Stephanie Robinson from their positions as faculty deans was neither an aberration nor an accident. It was an all but ineluctable step in Harvard's transformation of liberal education into a doctrine that enslaves students to intellectual fads and fashions, encourages the searching out and destruction of those with differing perspectives and thoughts, and equates grasping after power and imposing one's will - provided one possesses a high rank in the approved victim hierarchy - with justice.
Peter Berkowitz is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a contributor to RealClearPolitics, where this first appeared.

Texto completo: I was 13, a mere year younger than Kevin Richardson and Raymond Santana, two of the boys who made up Central Park Five, when they were wrongfully convicted of beating and raping the white female jogger Trisha Meili in 1989.
I had just returned to the United States after living in my father's country of Trinidad and Tobago for three years, and the televised melodramas that would cement my coming-of-age as a black woman -- Anita Hill testifying at Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearings, the videotape of Los Angeles police officers beating Rodney King, the O.J. Simpson Bronco chase -- had yet to happen.
Back in 1989, I was still a novice to the rules and rituals of American racism. But, like so many other African-American and Latino kids who lived in the New York metropolitan area, I was about to get a primer: The Central Park jogger case.
Because of my proximity to that trial, I thought I'd be prepared to watch "When They See Us," Ava DuVernay's four-part Netflix mini-series, debuting Friday, that depicts the horrifying events surrounding the case, and the excruciating toll the public persecution and swift conviction had on these teenage boys and their families.
Instead, it took me two days to watch the first episode, and after each pause, I had to convince myself that I could sit through the next scene.
This is not because this show lacks beauty or depth. It is thoughtfully cast, well-paced and visually stunning, thanks to DuVernay's longtime collaborator, the cinematographer Bradford Young. In fact, "When They See Us" is DuVernay's strongest work to date. But what makes it so devastating is its relentless portrayal of a criminal justice system that locks up, scapegoats and brutalizes black and brown American children with ease and enthusiasm. Part dirge, part indictment, the series stands out because it insists that we see the boys as they once were and as they always saw themselves: innocent.
[Read an interview with the Central Park Five.]
"When They See Us" is not the first project to delve into this subject matter. In 2003, Meili published a memoir, "I Am the Central Park Jogger: A Story of Hope and Possibility," in which she publicly revealed her identity for the first time, recounted her ordeal, and said that she has no memory of her attack and has been told by doctors she never will.
But, as a television mini-series, DuVernay's project more directly benefits from the archival research found in the 2012 documentary "The Central Park Five," directed by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon. Debuting at the dawn of President Obama's second term, that film "positioned itself as something of a public pardon," Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review. "Equal measures criminal investigation, cultural exhumation and a consideration of race in a presumptively postracial America, it seeks to set the record straight."
Seven years later, America looks very different. As a result, DuVernay's story eschews the measured tone of the documentary for an outrage more akin to to Anthony Davis's forthcoming opera, "The Central Park Five," and Alexandra Bell's new series of prints, "No Humans Involved -- After Sylvia Wynter." Appearing in this year's Whitney Biennial, Bell's photolithographs critique the media's coverage of the Central Park jogger case -- especially the New York Daily News and its racist headlines like "Park marauders call it 'Wilding"' and "Wolf Pack's Prey" -- and the publishing of Donald Trump's 1989 newspaper ad calling for the execution of these teenage boys.
And it is the horror of Trump's $ 85,000 full-page demand, and the heedless, racist rush to demonize children that it exemplified, that backdrops this mini-series. (This week offered a striking contrast in the form of President Trump's Twitter response to Robert Mueller's findings: "There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent.")
In the foreground, however, is a newer and even richer story: "When They See Us" restores the childhood innocence that the media, the police and prosecutors went to great lengths to deny and distort. It also grieves the years lost by the five victims, convicted as boys and released as men.
Time is paramount here. Opening in medias res, the first episode does not begin in Central Park, but in the comfort and familiarity of the boys' residential neighborhood of Harlem. Their playful banter and adolescent restlessness, and the youthful appearances of the actors, underscore the naïveté and vulnerability that enables them to be exploited and coerced into confessions by police officers who held and interrogated them on and off for 14 to 30 hours, often without their parents present.
The second episode is even more harrowing because it follows the conspiracy -- not the one boys are accused of, but the one mounted by the police and prosecutors who fudge timelines and overlook crucial evidence in order to expedite a guilty verdict. In the final two episodes, all but one of the boys is recast with an older actor, to mark how much they and the world have changed. (Korey Wise, the oldest of the boys, who was tried as an adult and sentenced to 5 to 15 years, is played throughout by a riveting Jharrel Jerome, known for "Moonlight.")
[Read the history of the Central Park Five case.]
DuVernay has explored police brutality and mass incarceration before, in her film "Middle of Nowhere," her Academy Award-nominated documentary "13th," and her TV series "Queen Sugar." But she uses time differently here, slowing it down enough for the viewer to feel the intensity of the boys' bewilderment at their setup by the cops and then speeding it up as we watch these men adjust back to society, forever tainted by their experiences.
The effect is a set of reversals in which DuVernay uses the conventions of the crime drama to upend our typical allegiances to police protagonists, and shift our gaze from the powerful to the targets of their institutional racism.
In fact, this case was solved not by any rigorous police investigation, but by a chance encounter and an unusual admission of guilt. Twelve years after the five were convicted, Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist (with whom Wise had a brief encounter at Rikers Island), confessed to prison officials that he was the one who attacked Meili. In 2002, after new DNA evidence corroborated Reyes's version of the events, the Central Park Five's convictions were vacated. And in 2014, they won a landmark $ 41 million settlement from the city. "No amount of money could have given us our time back," Yusef Salaam, who was 15 at the time of his conviction, recently said in an interview.
"When They See Us" does not pretend to make up for that lost time. Instead, it gives us something we haven't yet fully seen: their humanity, and the intimacy these boys nurtured with their families and, over time, with each other in order to survive. By doing so, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Korey Wise and Yusef Salaam emerge as the heroes of their own story -- and if we pay heed to the series' urgent message about criminal justice reform, ours too.

Texto completo: Former Bush press secretary was paid $30,000 by committee
Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's press secretary, has carved out a career as a prominent TV talking head, first on CNN and now on Fox News. In his many appearances on Fox, he has criticized mainstream media coverage of President Trump, bashed the president's political opponents and expressed general support for his agenda.
But there's one thing neither Fleischer nor Fox have told Fox's viewers: Fleischer recently worked for the Republican National Committee, creating an undisclosed financial tie between him and the president's party.
Federal disclosure records filed by the RNC indicate that Fleischer's public-relations consulting firm, Ari Fleischer Communications, received $30,000 last month for providing RNC employees coaching in handling media interviews.
TV pundits often have connections to political organizations or candidates; indeed, they are invited to comment on the air because of their experience or insider knowledge. But the standard practice among news organizations is to disclose these affiliations on the air.
The goal of such disclosures is transparency: By letting viewers know that a commentator is being paid by a political organization or candidate, it enables viewers to judge whether the commentator is motivated by his financial interests or is speaking independently of them.
During Fleischer's appearances on Fox News over the past months, Fox's hosts have accurately described him as a former White House press secretary and a Fox News "contributor," a term in TV news that means he is paid by the network to give his opinions. But Fox hasn't mentioned Fleischer's work for the RNC.
People at the network said they were unaware of Fleischer's involvement with the RNC until asked about it by a reporter on Tuesday. A spokeswoman, however, said Fox saw no need to disclose Fleischer's work for the RNC because he hasn't directly commented on the RNC itself.
"Fox News requires contributors to disclose ties related to any topic he or she discusses on the air in which the contributor may have a financial interest," the spokeswoman, Caley Cronin, said in a statement. "Ari Fleischer was not brought on to discuss - nor could we find any instance where he did discuss - the RNC on air while his firm was retained by the RNC to provide media training services."
Disclosure of pundits' financial connections by TV networks can be irregular and inconsistent. The New York Times won a Pulitzer Prize in 2009 for revealing the undisclosed connections among the Pentagon, defense contractors and former U.S. military officers who appeared regularly on TV news programs offering "analysis" that was favorable to the administration and defense industry. In many cases, the military pundits had financial connections to defense contractors that weren't disclosed to viewers.
In an interview, Fleischer said the payment from the RNC was for three sessions of media training he conducted with the organization's employees in the past few months. He said it was the first time he had worked directly for the RNC.
Fleischer said he did not disclose his work for the RNC to Fox because he was not aware any such disclosure was required. In any case, he said, he saw no conflicts and no reason to disclose his financial relationship with the party to the network or to its viewers.
"I don't think it would be a surprise to any viewers," he said. "They know I support Republican causes, but I'm a pretty independent voice, too. . . . They know I'm a former press secretary for George Bush and that my views come from 21 years in Washington."
He drew a distinction between his work for the RNC and that of, say, a pundit who works directly for a candidate or a political action committee that seeks to elect candidates. "It's not as if I'm a consultant to the RNC," he said.
Fleischer has made 10 appearances on Fox programs, including on Sean Hannity's and Laura Ingraham's prime-time shows, since the RNC's filing on April 25. During that time, he has made no comments about the RNC itself, although most of his comments have aligned with the RNC's positions.
During one appearance last week, for example, he told host Shannon Bream that the FBI's "entire investigations of the president, President Trump, was not merited." He also told Ingraham that Attorney General William P. Barr "is a seasoned, experienced attorney general, and that's exactly what we need now to figure out what, if anything, was done improperly when they authorized all these wiretaps and surveillance techniques to be used against Trump."
Fleischer's ties to the RNC are at least the third instance in the past two years in which the network didn't disclose the vested interest of one of its commentators.
Fox repeatedly solicited comments last year from former Justice Department official Robert Driscoll about Mueller's investigation, but the network only irregularly mentioned on the air that Driscoll was the attorney for Maria Butina, a suspected Russian spy, according to NPR. Butina was convicted in April of failing to register as a foreign agent. Fox said it addressed the disclosure issue with its program producers. It hasn't invited Driscoll back as a general commentator, according to program transcripts in the Nexis database.
Fox and the Fox Business Network also featured Mark Serrano, a Trump booster, who was a former adviser to President George H.W. Bush, multiple times without mentioning that Serrano's firm was a paid consultant to Trump's 2020 reelection campaign.
The networks said they were unaware of Serrano's involvement with Trump and that his ties should have been disclosed. A representative said in mid-2017 that Serrano wouldn't be booked on Fox programs "for the foreseeable future" as a result of the nondisclosure of his work for Trump.
Serrano has appeared just once on a Fox program since then, according to Nexis.

Sorry, but that USS McCain story isn't fake news

Texto completo: Someone associated with the White House wanted the USS John McCain out of sight while President Trump visited Japan. This is not fake news.
Of course, the usual suspects are calling it so anyway.
TweetBut the original Wall Street Journal article which broke the story hasn't fallen apart. In fact, other news outlet have independently corroborated most of the details.
On Wednesday night, the Journal reported that, per planning with the White House Military Office and the Seventh Fleet of the Navy, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official emailed instructions to Navy and Air Force officials to keep the USS John McCain out of sight. The Journal did not charge Trump with ordering the removal of the ship, but three U.S. officials confirmed the existence of the email to the Associated Press, and two Navy officials confirmed to CNN that the directive did originate from the White House Military Office. Two Navy sailors told the New York Times that, unlike sailors from other American warships at the Yokosuka Naval Base, sailors from the McCain were not invited to meet with Trump. The Pacific Fleet even confirmed to CBS the Journal's assertion that the ship was covered by a tarp on Friday, although the plan was abandoned and the tarp removed by the time Trump arrived in Japan.
The only piece of the original Journal story not independently corroborated is the allegation that acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan knew of the scheme. For what it's worth, Shanahan categorically denies having known anything about it and has promised to get to the bottom of the scheme.
So save for the Shanahan allegation, what part of this story is fake? Trump denies ordering the plan, but the journalists who wrote these stories never accused him of doing so. The plan to obscure the ship clearly wasn't executed by the time Trump arrived in Japan, let alone at Yokosuka, but the journalists who wrote these stories never said it was.
What we do know is that someone from the White House thought that Trump would be so triggered by the ship that he or she had the audacity to direct multiple groups of people to conceal a first class destroyer. And we now know that, on some level, that person's instincts were correct.Tweet

As Barr mulls declassification, a familiar tune from critics

Texto completo: In February 2018, the House Intelligence Committee released the so-called Nunes memo. In four pages, the document, from the committee’s then-chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, revealed much of what the public knows today about the FBI’s reliance on the Steele dossier in pursuing since-discredited allegations that the Trump campaign and Russia conspired to fix the 2016 election. Specifically, it revealed that the FBI included unverified material from the dossier in applications to a secret spy court to win a warrant to wiretap Trump foreign policy volunteer adviser Carter Page.
All that was classified. To release it, the committee appealed to President Donald Trump, who made a declassification order. That is the only way Americans know about the Page warrant. From that knowledge came later revelations about the FBI’s use of confidential informants and undercover agents to get information on Trump campaign figures.
It is good that the public knows such things, just as it is good that the public knows what is in the Mueller report. But in the days before the Nunes memo was declassified, many of the nation’s top current and former intelligence officials, members of Congress, and analysts in the press warned that declassification would do grave damage to American national security.
It didn’t happen.
Now, some of the same people are issuing somber warnings of the damage that will be done if Attorney General William Barr declassifies documents showing what else the nation’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies did in the 2016 Trump investigation.
In 2018, former CIA Director John Brennan said of the Nunes memo, "I never witnessed the type of reckless partisan behavior I am now seeing." Recently, Brennan called the Barr declassification project "a reckless, reckless initiative."
In 2018, Rep. Adam Schiff, the current chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the Nunes memo "crosses a dangerous line." Recently, he said the Barr initiative marks "a new and dangerous phase."
In 2018, former Attorney General Eric Holder called the Nunes memo "unheard of," "dangerous" and "irresponsible." Recently, he called the Barr initiative "the height of irresponsibility" and "a dangerous precedent."
Many others echoed Brennan’s and Schiff’s and Holder’s sentiments. The problem is, they were wrong then, and they are likely wrong again now.
The revelation that the FBI used the Steele dossier -- the collection of unconfirmed anti-Trump dirt compiled for the Hillary Clinton campaign by the former British spy Christopher Steele -- set off a tremendous argument about the dossier’s reliability. But there was no doubt that the Nunes memo was correct, that the FBI had indeed cited the dossier as evidence in its argument that Carter Page should be wiretapped. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that some of the loudest voices denouncing Nunes were angry about the exposure of the FBI’s questionable actions, and not the fact that the FBI’s actions were indeed questionable.
Indeed, after the release of the Nunes memo, there was little discussion of any specific damage it had done to U.S. national security.
Now, there is another fight about declassification. Nunes himself has heard this all before. "Every time we have tried to get information on the Russia hoax, the left as well as the media and their leakers claimed it would devastate national security," Nunes said in a text exchange. "Now we hear the same argument from the same reporters, leakers and leftists, even though all their previous doomsday warnings proved false. These people simply use national security as a false justification to hide information that would reveal their abuses."
Nunes summed up with one more line: "Democracy dies in darkness."
The resistance to declassification is likely to be ferocious. Almost immediately after President Trump ordered intelligence agencies to cooperate with Barr and gave the attorney general "full and complete authority" to declassify information from the Trump-Russia investigation, the intelligence world struck back when The New York Times reported that Barr’s project could endanger one of the CIA’s most prized sources.
Attributing its story to "former officials," the Times said the source was someone "close to (Vladimir) Putin" who gave the CIA "information about (Putin’s) involvement" in U.S. election interference, and specifically turned over evidence to support the conclusion that "Putin himself was behind the Russia hack." The source had been "long nurtured" by the CIA and was highly valued by Brennan when he was director. All of that work might be at risk if Barr moves ahead, the Times suggested.
Now, if anything might endanger such a source, it would be exposure in The New York Times. But the story showed that the intelligence world will push back hard against this new effort to investigate its record. The fight could be messy. But Barr, like Nunes, has heard such threats before. It’s time to find out what the CIA, FBI and other agencies did in those difficult days of the 2016 campaign.

King says not all cultures contribute alike

Texto completo: At a Webster County town hall on Tuesday, Rep. Steve King said presuming all cultures are equal devalues the 'founding fathers,' and tangled with an event attendee who said King discriminated against Mexican and non-white Americans.
The Kiron Republican said, as he has before, that he cares about history and Western civilization — not race.
"If we presume that every culture is equal and has an equal amount to contribute to our civilization, then we're devaluing the contributions of the people that laid the foundation for America and that's our founding fathers," King said in Fort Dodge. "It is not about race, it's never been about race. It is about culture."
Christina Russell, a Fort Dodge resident, said that his Facebook posts suggest he represents conservatives rather than all 4th District residents — including those who don't share his views. King responded that many people like his presence on Facebook.
"There's a warning banner on there, and you should read that, I think you would never go there again, because it says 'don't go here unless you have a sense of humor,'" King said.
Russell said she disagreed with King's characterization of his Facebook posts as just a "sense of humor."
Earlier this year, he posted a Facebook meme depicting figures of made up of red states punching blue states with the caption, "Folks keep talking about another Civil War ... One side has about 8 trillion bullets, while the other side doesn't know which bathroom to use." King later deleted the picture.
"Making fun of brown people and criminalizing them, it's not a joke, it's not a sense of humor," Russell said. "Dehumanizing the Mexican culture is not a joke."
King has repeatedly caused uproars over his comments about Western civilization, race and non-Western civilizations. Earlier this year, his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy to the New York Times, which he said were misinterpreted, caused Republican leadership to strip him of committee assignments.
On Tuesday, he said he is making progress in winning back his committee seats and fighting back against what he called a "political lynch mob."
"I've been Mr. Nice Guy about this all along and let the cooler heads take over and now ... pretty soon I'm going to start pushing," he said.

Texto completo: Since losing the 2018 Georgia governor's race, Stacey Abrams has given self-pity a bad name. "I did win," Ms. Abrams still insists, making fantastic claims of a stolen election. She says Republican Gov. Brian Kemp holds the office only because "it was not a free and fair election." Never mind his 54,723-vote margin of victory; she's hoping that repeating a falsehood will make it true and pave her way to the governorship in 2022, if not the presidency in 2020.
How did Democrats respond to Ms. Abrams's unsupported and incendiary charges? They selected her to deliver the party's response to President Trump's State of the Union address.
Ms. Abrams's indictment of Mr. Kemp, the former Georgia secretary of state, starts with the accusation that he closed or moved polling locations. She contends this created confusion and meant "black people faced hourslong lines . . . waiting to cast their ballots." But by law, polling places are selected by independent county election boards, not the secretary of state.
Moreover, long lines affected Georgians of all races this past November, as turnout rose from 2.59 million in 2014 to 3.95 million in 2018, the biggest-ever total in a Peach State governor's race. Ms. Abrams's claim that Georgia was ground zero for "suppression" of black voters is undermined by the state's gap in turnout, which was higher among blacks than whites.
Ms. Abrams also argues that Mr. Kemp used the state's "exact match" law to "disenfranchise voters of color." This law requires basic information on voter-registration applications to match that on Georgia's driver's license list, in Social Security records, or on state-issued IDs for those who don't drive. Mr. Kemp's office notified 53,000 registrants that their applications didn't match and informed them that under the law they had 26 months to correct their forms. In the meantime, they could still vote after showing photo ID, which is required of all Georgians.
To stir the pot, Ms. Abrams frequently points out that while 32% of Georgians are black, nearly 70% of the erroneous forms were for blacks. She fails to mention that a registration drive she led submitted more than a quarter of the flawed forms.
Then there's Georgia's "use it or lose it" law. Passed by a Democratic Legislature and signed by a Democratic governor in 1997, it says that if a voter hasn't shown up at the polls or had contact with election authorities (say, by signing a petition or updating an address) in three years, the state must notify him that he's at risk of becoming "inactive." If he then doesn't return a postage-paid card or participate in either of the next two federal elections, he's purged from the rolls. It's at least a six-year process.
Mr. Kemp's office removed 1.4 million names from the rolls starting in 2012, erasing a backlog he inherited. Still, active registrations grew from 5,033,307 when he was elected in 2010 to 6,428,581 last fall, a 27.7% increase. Much of this bump came after Mr. Kemp implemented automatic voter registration for Georgians who update or apply for their driver's licenses. For her part, Ms. Abrams never worked to repeal the use-it-or-lose-it or exact-match law during her decade in the Georgia legislature. In fact, while she criticizes Mr. Kemp for reducing opportunities for early voting, she not only voted to require him to rein in early voting, but co-sponsored the 2011 law.
Upon examination, her "stolen election" claim is a sore loser's excuse. Ms. Abrams admitted as much to the New York Times last month: "I have no empirical evidence that I would have achieved a higher number of votes." That hasn't stopped her from smearing her state. Nor has it kept Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Robert Francis O'Rourke and Kamala Harris from echoing her scurrilous charge.
Like P.T. Barnum, Ms. Abrams puts on an entertaining show that's richly rewarding -- for herself. She creates nonprofits with noble-sounding names, hires herself, and fills the payroll with campaign staffers who enjoy paychecks between elections. Before the 2018 contest, her perch was a voter-registration group called New Georgia Project. Now she has two nonprofits. One is Fair Fight, which files lawsuits and attacks Gov. Kemp. The other is Fair Count, which encourages her supporters in Georgia to fill out census questionnaires. But she gave away their real purpose, explaining: "We can win this fight long-term by changing the structure of power." That means putting her in office.
Ms. Abrams is attempting to build a political future on failure. It says something about our times that she'll decide by September whether or not to run for president -- and that Democrats take her seriously.

Texto completo: Osteoporosis is a disease that affects both men and women, though women at about twice the rate as men. Combined, there are approximately 54 million Americans age 50 and older now living with osteoporosis or low bone mass. But the National Osteoporosis Foundation predicts that this number will grow by a million a year over the next decade.
"Osteoporosis is a process where the bones lose their strength," said Dr. Cristina Beato, Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. Beato, a former Acting Assistant Secretary for Health and Human Services in President George W. Bush's administration, said osteoporosis is a product of aging but can also "happen early in life."
Osteoporosis targets all ethnic groups but not equally. In a study conducted by the New Jersey Department of Public Health, it concluded that approximately one in ten Hispanic women over age 50 suffers with this disease. But nearly 50 percent of Hispanic women over age 50 will have low bone mass. The same study showed that three percent of Hispanic males age 50 and over have osteoporosis and 23 percent have low bone mass.
Women and particularly menopausal women are especially susceptible to osteoporosis. When estrogen or hormone levels go down or when there are no or infrequent menstrual periods bone mass is weakened. But other factors contributing to osteoporosis are family history and lifestyle, says Beato.
Beato said smoking is "the biggest negative" impacting women and osteoporosis. Women who smoke should stop immediately, she said. Tobacco has been linked to loss of bone density because it negatively compromises bone cells. The more a woman smokes, the higher her risk of bone fracture as she ages.
On the surface, osteoporosis may seem more inconvenient than dangerous but that is actually not the reality, said Beato. A simple fall for someone with osteoporosis-one easily recoverable in youth-can result in a broken bone for someone with osteoporosis or low bone mass. It is estimated that a third of all women as well as one in five men with osteoporosis will break a bone because of this disease. And broken bones, especially a hip or spine, can lead to longterm disability and a decline in quality of life.
This is a disease that results in an estimated two million broken bones each year, said the NOF. The cost for repairing broken bone damage among Hispanic is estimated at $2 billion per year by 2025. But despite the fact that there is no cure for osteoporosis, there are basic things that can be done to manage it.
"Go back to basics," said Beato. Don't smoke, eat healthy and get exercise, she said. Doing these very simple things would result in osteoporosis "not being as prevalent." There are also things you can do to strengthen your bones. Good core body strength "will help the spinal column," and lessen back pain.
In postmenopausal women or men who are approaching age 70, there are signs and symptoms that may indicate osteoporosis. They include back pain, loss of height, stooped posture or a bone fracture that you may have thought was just a simple bruise or minor injury.
Those worried about osteoporosis or loss of bone mass should speak with their health care specialist. But another way of addressing osteoporosis is through diet and calcium intake. Calcium is the mineral that strengthens bones and is also one of the easiest ways of self-maintenance.
Calcium strengthens bones and teeth. It also plays an important role in heart health and blood clotting. Doctors say we should all try our best to meet daily intake requirements for calcium. Dairy products, including milk, yogurt, cheese and calcium-fortified cottage cheese are recommended. Green, leafy vegetables including broccoli, kale and collard greens are also good for boosting calcium levels. Fish and nuts, especially Brazil nuts and almonds, are also recommended.
There are also drugs that doctors may recommend altering the impact of osteoporosis. One family of drugs is bisphosphonates. They're said to stop the loss of bone, but they do not rebuild. The New York Times recently reported on a newly approved drug for osteoporosis. Romosozumab whose brand name is Evenity is said to rebuild bone without breaking it down.
But short of drugs, said Beato, common sense and personal responsibility about health is the best start for those dealing with osteoporosis as well as others approaching the age when it most often begins to surface. "Usually if you eat nutritiously, maintain your weight and don't smoke, you will maintain the integrity of your bones." A long life is good," she said. "A long quality of life is also good."

Sidebar La osteoporosis afecta a las mujeres hispanas en altos niveles
La Osteoporosis es una enfermedad que afecta tanto a hombres como mujeres, aunque las mujeres tienen aproximadamente el doble de frecuencia que los hombre. Combinados, hay aproximadamente 54 millones de estadounidenses de 50 años o más que viven con osteoporosis o masa ósea baja. Pero la National Osteoporosis Foundation predice que este número crecerá a un millón por año en la próxima década.
"La Osteoporosis es un proceso en el que los huesos pierden fuerza", dijo la Dra. Cristina Beato, profesora asociada de la Escuela de Medicina de la Universidad de Nuevo México. Beato, quien también se desempeñócomo ex subsecretaria adjunta de Salud y Servicios Humanos en la administración del presidente George W. Bush, dijo que la osteoporosis es un producto del envejecimiento, pero que también puede "suceder en una etapa temprana en la vida".
La Osteoporosis ataca a todos los grupos étnicos pero no igualmente. En un estudio hecho por el New Jersey Department of Public Health, concluyó que aproximada- mente diez mujeres hispanas de más de 50 años sufren de la enfermedad. Pero cerca del 50 por ciento de las mujeres hispanas mayores de 50 años tendrán una masa ósea baja. El mismo estudio demuestra que el tres por ciento de hombrees hispanos de 50 años y más tiene osteoporosis y el 23 por ciento tienen una baja masa ósea.
Las mujeres y especialmente las mujeres menopáusicas son más susceptibles a la osteoporosis. Cuando los niveles de estrógeno u hormonas disminuyen o cuando no hay períodos menstruales o la frecuencia dela menstruación es poco frecuente, la masa ósea se debilita. Pero otros factores que contribuyentes a la osteoporosis son la historia familiar y el estilo de vida, dice Beato.
Beato dijo que fumar es "lo más negativo" que afecta a las mujeres y la osteoporosis. Las mujeres que fuman deben dejar esto inmediatamente, dijo. El tabaco ha sido asociado a la pérdida de densidad ósea porque compromete negativamente las células óseas. Entre más fume una mujer, mayor es el riesgo de fractura ósea a medida que envejece.
En la superficie, la osteoporosis puede parecer más inconveniente que peligrosa pero eso verdaderamente no es vedad, dijo Beato. Una simple caída para alguien que tiene la osteoporosis-una fácilmente recuperable en la juventudpuede terminar en un hueso roto para alguien con la osteoporosis o baja masa ósea. Se calcula que un tercio de todas las mujeres y una de cada cinco hombres con osteoporosis se romperá un hueso debido a esta enfermedad. Y los huesos rotos, especialmente en la cadera o en la columna vertebral, pueden llevar a una discapacidad a largo plazo y una disminución en la calidad de vida.
Esta es una enfermedad que produce un estimado de dos millones de huesos rotos cada año, dijo la NOF (por sus siglas en inglés). El costo de reparar daños de los huesos rotos entre los hispanos se estima en dos mil millones de dólares por año para el 2025. Pero a pesar del hecho de que no existe cura para la osteoporosis, hay cosas básicas que se pueden hacer para controlarla.
"Vuelva a lo básico", dijo Beato. No fume, coma saludable y haga ejercicio, dijo. Hacer estas cosas muy simples resultaría en que las osteoporosis "no sea tan frecuente". Hay también cosas que uno puede hacer para fortalecer los huesos. La buena fortaleza corporal "ayudará a la columna vertebral," y reduce el dolor de espalda.
En mujeres posmenopáusicas u hombres que se están acercando a la edad de 70 años, hay señales y síntomas que pueden indicar la osteoporosis. Incluyen dolor de espalda, perdida de estatura, postura encorvada o una fractura ósea que usted podría haber pensado que era solo una simple contusión o una lesión menor.
Esos que se preocupan de la osteoporosis o pérdida de masa ósea deben hablar con su especialista de salud. Pero otra forma de atender a la osteoporosis es por medio de la dieta y uso de calcio. El calcio es el mineral que fortalece los huesos y también uno de las formas más fáciles de automantenimiento.
El calcio fortalece los huesos y los dientes. También juega un papel importante en la salud del corazón y coagulación sanguínea. Los médicos dicen que debemos hacer lo mejor posible para ajustarse a los requerimientos del calcio. Se recomiendan los productos lácteos, incluyendo la leche, el yogurt, queso y requesón-fortificado con calcio. Legumbres de hojas verdes, como el brócoli, kale y legumbres verdes son buenos para aumentar los niveles del calcio. Pescado y nueces, especialmente las almendras de Brasil y las almendras, también son recomendables.
También hay medicamentos que los médicos pueden recomendar para alterar el impacto de la osteoporosis. Una familia de medicamentos es la bifosfonatos. Se dice que detienen la pérdida del hueso, pero no se reconstruyen. El New York Times reportó recientemente un nuevo medicamento aprobado para la osteoporosis. Romosozumab cuyo nombre de fábrica es Evenity se dice que es para reconstruir el hueso sin romperlo.
Pero a falta de medicamentos, dijo Beato, el sentido común y la responsabilidad personal sobre la salud es el mejor comienzo para quienes se enfrentan a la osteoporosis y para otros que se acercan a la edad en que la mayoría de las veces comienza a aparecer. "Generalmente, si come de manera nutritiva, mantiene su peso y no fuma, mantendrá la integridad de sus huesos". Una larga vida es buena", dijo. "Una larga calidad de vida también es buena".

What's cyber-speak for 'caveat emptor'?

Texto completo: As the back-and-forth between President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi escalates, in what promises to be the most unusual national campaign America has ever seen, there's something we need to remember about social media.
Like it or not, Facebook, Twitter and other online sources are now major shapers of public opinion. They ought to be frivolous little cyber toys – a way to send friends pictures of our grandchildren or what we're having for lunch — but anything with billions of users was bound to wind up being used by politically.
There's serious stuff, and provocative opinion, and timely information about people and events in our neighborhood or around the world. And there's fake news – not just the stuff that irritates Trump, but deliberate lies planted by people who want you to think this way or that way about a candidate or issue.
As a Luddite who has learned just enough about computers to use email and click on URLs, I've developed two rules. They are:
Get information from multiple sources – print, broadcast and reputable sites – and disregard anything, good or bad, from sources you don't know.
Everything you see is there because someone, somewhere wants you to buy a product or think a certain way about a person or topic.
Last week, Facebook announced it had removed nearly 3.4 billion fake accounts in just the last six months, twice the number it axed in the preceding six months. That's a billion more fakes than the 2.4 billion real people using the global system.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg said most of the fakes were nabbed within minutes of creation, doing no harm. The company also said it's making great strides in combating hate speech and online crime.
That's good, if true, but the danger of censoring hateful and stupid voices is greater than the comfort of not having them among my chit-chat with friends.
The unprecedented volume and reach of modern media have made a wistful memory out of that old line about a lie running halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on. Today lies whiz past each other in hyperspace, unimpeded, and we're already forwarding some posts and contradicting others before anyone ventures a truthful rebuttal.
It was bad enough when people just spread crazy rumors. Did you get the message about "Congressional Bill 42-P," purporting to be a five-cent tax on every email message you send? Or the online petition for a "28th Amendment" to set congressional term limits, make members obey all laws they impose on us, and do a few other nice-sounding things, depending on which version of the hoax you received?
And there was that old Obama-is-a-Muslim-from-Kenya favorite. Somebody would send me that one about once a week when I was reporting. If I asked where they got it, they'd invariably say, "Well it's all over the internet!"
Oh, gosh, if somebody typed it on a keyboard, you know it's true.
The nut stuff is easily spotted, but hoaxes are more sophisticated now. In an election year marked by sharp division on issues like abortion and guns, they're malicious.
The same day Facebook said it had smothered all those fake accounts, the Washington Post reported on a video that had been slowed down to make Nancy Pelosi sound drunk. This was no computer glitch. Whoever floated the fake recording on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook – with views running into the hundreds of thousands – also altered the tone of her voice, so it didn't go too deep when the tape was slowed.
President Trump complains of "fake news" from the New York Times, CNN and other established media. But, like them or not, we know who they are and what business they're in. On the internet, we don't know who's spreading information, or where they got it, or why they want us to think it.

Eric Swalwell’s campaign setting new world records in cringe

Texto completo: Watching Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., compete in the Democratic presidential primary for the woke-est straight white male title is to test the limits of how hard a human being can cringe before collapsing into complete seizure.
There is nothing natural about his parody of a social justice campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Swalwell posted some tweets over the holiday weekend flexing his sensitivity muscles for the social justice grievance crowd. One of the them said that “Being a good president doesn't mean you speak the loudest or tweet the most. Being a good president means knowing when to listen.” Included in the tweet was a photo of Swalwell sitting amidst five black people in Chicago.
I’m sure the Chicagoans were grateful that Swalwell, who repeatedly acknowledges that he’s white, was there to help by listening. Having a white male show up and explain how his presence is what makes a for a good president is no doubt exactly what they needed.
Coincidentally, prominent black activist Alicia Garza wrote Tuesday in the New York Times that no, this is precisely what they don’t need. “During election season, I always cringe when I see candidates eating fried chicken next to a bottle of hot sauce in Harlem or taking staged photos with black leaders,” wrote Garza. “These shallow symbolic gestures are not a substitute for meaningful engagement with black voters. And candidates should know that we see right through them.”
In a separate tweet on Sunday, Swalwell wrote that he “may be ‘another white guy,’ but I know where there are gaps in my knowledge or my experience and I know when to pass the mic.” Attached was a video clip from a new interview with Vice, wherein he promised again that as the Democratic nominee, he would pick a woman to serve as his running mate. “Where there would be gaps in my knowledge or my experience,” said Swalwell, “I will pass the mic to people who do have that experience.”
Swalwell apparently believes he’s got a crowd pleaser with his corny “pass the mic” phrase. In late April, he said in an interview on MSNBC that it’s important to “recognize where you can’t speak for someone’s experience and pass the mic to someone who can.”
Does he know he’s running to lead the country and not to lead an AA meeting? I don’t recall President Barack Obama choosing to “pass the mic” to RuPaul when a bunch of gays were shot up at an Orlando night club.
This is a naked, debasing, humiliating pander by Swalwell to the social justice mob that now lords over the Democratic Party. But he’s unaware that to “pass the mic” isn’t about taking turns. It’s about giving up his turn altogether. The very question he was responding to in the Vice interview was, "Why should another white guy be president?" In other words, Don't you think it's time you step aside for someone else, Mr. Swalwell?
Running for president and choosing to “pass the mic” is like serving as the best man and asking someone else to give the toast. It’s not honorable. It’s just weird.

Texto completo: Frugality is in my bones.
From attending a community college before public university to living with my wife in a stunning tree house that I built from salvaged materials to driving my 15-year-old Volvo – I’ve always avoided expensive stuff.
Here are my sometimes silly cheapskate tricks I've collected from a long life of adventures, at home and abroad.
At home and work:
A 1/2-inch binder clip beats any wallet. It holds cash, credit cards, and the rest. It’s smaller – takes less pocket space so it’s more comfortable – and costs basically nothing.
New suits and dress shirts? I’ve always gotten the cheapest machine washable available, these days via Amazon. Saving here never stopped me from becoming wealthy. You’ll never get rich via looks – unless it’s Hollywood or by marrying rich.
BBQ warning: Sorry, but you're grilling your burgers wrong, and it could kill you
Gas price guide: As you head out for Memorial Day, watch out for the 10 states where gas prices are highest
I’m a compulsive walker. By visiting a good cobbler before they’re shot, dress shoes last virtually forever. Over the decades, you'll save big by avoiding buying shoes repeatedly. Good cobblers can handle leather and luggage repairs; so my classic briefcase looks 5 years old but is now over 25.
I haven’t suffered a barber in over 40 years. Cutting your own hair saves money and time, big time. I use scissors and comb, like barbers. But self-cutting kits are easy and cheap online.
Anyone can save hundreds to thousands via energy savers like dropping your thermostat five degrees at night while using an electric blanket. (Google: “home energy savers. ”)
Things I never leave home without:
Paper clips can multitask. When a zipper pull-tab breaks, on pants, suitcase, whatever – the clip threads through the zipper’s hole. Works for months. I’ve never, ever replaced it on one pair of pants. I have large clips permanently zippering my beloved old suitcase. They’re as comfortable as manufacturer’s tabs.
But $15 buys enough zipper repair gear online for permanent fix-its. Paper clips also make temporary fasteners (like a chain link or key chain). With one end straightened, they make great pokers – or a hook to pull – when things get stuck in small awkward places. Safety pins make great fasteners, too.
Duct tape fixes almost anything. Stuck inside clothing it patches most rips temporarily – avoiding embarrassment. Learn to sew and carry traveler’s kits. They’re tiny and cheap. These fix-its salvage clothes, otherwise destroyed, and lets you keep truckin’. I learned sewing via my Boy Scout merit badge days. It has paid off endlessly. And one tiny super glue is super useful and indispensable for so many breaks.
Online $3-to-$12 buys a foreign made metal nail clipper with a 2-inch knife blade hidden inside – which makes it through airport security. A blade is oh-so handy traveling.
Finally, wherever you are:
Google the phrase, "learning to sleep well anywhere, anytime. " It’s an art form. Makes life comfier. Saves money, too. How? Get the very cheapest, clean, safe hotels – and only be in them for sleeping and hygiene. Get out and do stuff. You’re not traveling to stare at fancy, expensive hotel walls. Motel 6? OK, but Motel 5 1/4 will do.
My biggest, best money saver and cheapskate trick? Never get divorced. Commit to learn to fix each other when broken. My boss and I almost killed each other repeatedly when young. Fix it; you’ll be glad later you did.
Pay up for quality where it really counts; like top-tier health care. Otherwise, it’s just blowing money down some rat hole. You won’t become a multibillionaire by saving money. But saving a little along the way never hurts.

Texto completo: Sen. Joni Ernst advised President Trump exercise caution when deciding whether to pardon service members accused of war crimes.
“I’ll just be up front and say I don’t know the details of what went through the prosecution in that particular case," the Iowa Republican said in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” Sunday. "But I would say if our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, if they are accused and found guilty of war crimes, we need to be very careful in that because It is not okay to perpetrate war crimes.”
“I would just advise the president to be very careful, scrutinize each case individually, and if it’s warranted, grant a pardon,” said Ernst, an Iraq War veteran who served in the U.S. Army Reserves. “If it is not, and someone has committed a war crime, then a sentenced should be served.”

The New York Times reported last week that Trump was considering issuing pardons on or around Memorial Day for multiple members of the military accused or convicted of war crimes.
The White House reportedly made expedited requests to obtain necessary paperwork to pardon service members including Navy SEAL Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, who was charged with shooting unarmed civilians and killing an enemy captive with a knife during a deployment in Iraq.
Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., also weighed in on the issue Sunday and argued "one of the things that protects our troops morally and physically is the knowledge that if anybody in uniform does commit a crime, they will be held accountable by military justice."
“For a president, especially a president who never served, to say he’s going to come in and overrule that system of military justice undermines the very foundations, legal and moral, of this country," Buttigieg, an Afghanistan War veteran, said in an interview with ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopolous” that aired Sunday.
Trump said Friday that no decisions were finalized and added he may hold off issuing pardons until the trials wrapped up.
"There’s two or three of them right now," Trump told reporters. "It’s a little bit controversial. It’s very possible that I’ll let the trials go on, and I’ll make my decision after the trial."
"Some of these soldiers are people that have fought hard and long," Trump said. "You know, we teach them how to be great fighters, and then when they fight, sometimes they get really treated very unfairly."

New evidence links Colombia army chief to civilian slayings

Texto completo: The Associated Press
BOGOTA, Colombia - New evidence has emerged linking the embattled head of Colombia's army to the alleged cover-up of civilian killings more than a decade ago.
The documents, provided to The Associated Press by a person familiar with an ongoing investigation into the extrajudicial killings, come as Gen. Nicacio Martínez Espinel faces mounting pressure to resign over orders he gave troops this year to step up attacks in what some fear could pave the way for a return of serious human rights violations.
Colombia's military has been blamed for as many as 5,000 extrajudicial killings at the height of the country's armed conflict in the mid-2000s as troops under pressure by top commanders inflated body counts, in some cases dressing up civilians as guerrillas in exchange for extra pay and other perks.
What became known as the "false positives" scandal has cast a dark shadow over the U.S.-backed military's record of battleground victories. Fifteen years later, not a single top commander has been held accountable for the slayings.
Martínez Espinel in a statement said he faces no criminal or disciplinary investigations.
"I always have been and will be ready to answer any questions by authorities," he said.
Vivanco said it's no surprise Martínez isn't under investigation given authorities' willingness to turn a blind eye to the responsibility of top commanders in the killing spree. While Colombian courts have convicted hundreds of low-ranking soldiers for their roles in the "false positive" murders, not a single general and only a handful of coronels have so far been convicted. Under international law, commanders can be held responsible for crimes carried out by subordinates that they knew about or should have known about.
Now there are reports that Martínez Espinel as army chief is looking to reinstate the policies that critics say led to the executions.
The New York Times reported recently that Martínez Espinel commanded troops to double the number of leftist guerrillas and criminals they kill, capture or force to surrender in combat. The new guidelines, made in writing at the start of Martínez Espinel's tenure as army chief in January, raised concerns among unnamed officers cited by the Times about the heightened risk of civilian causalities.
Opponents of Duque have called for Martínez Espinel to resign, pointing to a number of suspicious killings and cover-ups by soldiers this year coinciding with the new orders. But the conservative leader has so far stood by the commander even while attempting to contain the damage.
"Zero tolerance for those who dishonor the fatherland's uniform by committing crimes," Duque said hours after the Times report sent shockwaves through the armed forces, one of Colombia's most-respected institutions.
Meanwhile, in response to the Times article the armed forces rolled back part of the controversial policy requiring field commanders to pledge in writing to double their operational results against criminal gangs and holdout rebels who have filled the void left by a 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
They left unchanged, however, orders instructing officers not to "demand perfection" from sources, saying attacks on military targets should be launched when there is a "60-70% credibility" about the veracity of information.
On Friday, Duque announced the creation of a blue-ribbon panel to evaluate all military protocols and manuals to make sure they are in accordance with the government's commitment to respecting human rights and international humanitarian law.

Goodbye,commenting;you will notbe missed

Texto completo: 1A is a two-hour daily national public radio call-in show focusing on topics arising from consideration of the First Amendment to our Constitution – the protection of religion, speech, the press, assembly and petition.

And last week, the producers of the program removed the “comment” button from the show's website, adding that it's unlikely their to-be-remodeled site will have a comment section in the future.
The Monitor's editors – as some keen readers of the online paper no doubt noticed – disabled the comment function of its own website several weeks ago.
Producers of 1A explained that it is “hard to moderate comments, and we have noticed that lewd bots have found a way in.” I'm not sure just what “lewd bots” are, but it sounds like a genteel way to say that disruptive and determined commenters keep managing to elude discovery in order to insult, harangue and pick fights with other, more civil participants.
Monitor editor Steve Leone was more direct in his excellent, carefully wrought open letter to the paper's readers, explaining that by providing room for comments on the website, the newspaper had hoped to provide a space “where readers would be able to have a conversation about our stories that would go deeper than we could offer in print.
“Some website commenters have indeed used the platform in ways that elevate the conversation. But in too many instances, the comments section of our website has fallen below the standards we set in print, and it's increasingly become a space dominated by a few voices.”
He politely doesn't characterize those “few voices,” so I will: They are bullies. And they had, over time, driven people who were interested in having actual conversations – as opposed to shouting – away from concordmonitor.com.
I want to make it clear that I most definitely do not speak for the Concord Monitor. I do not work for the Monitor. I merely have the privilege of being a Monitor columnist, which mostly means that the newspaper allows me to offer my opinions on its pages.
And my opinion is that online commenting was a generous and idealistic concept that went seriously awry and deserves to be ended.
It all sounded so good, this business of generating thoughtful conversations among discerning readers of all stripes. The practice began around 1999, and by 2007 and 2008 nearly every publication was doing it, including this newspaper.
At first, for the Monitor, it was – as Leone said – like the Wild West, with the paper's website awash with wildly diverse, even crazy comments posted by a raft of pseudonymous readers. From the start, the comments required policing, diverting editors and reporters from their core mission, reporting the news. And various systems were adopted to try to tame the beast.
Leone wasn't the first to try to address the issue. In 2013, then Monitor editor Felice Belman published an exasperated column on it:
“How difficult is it to stay on the right side of the law?
“It shouldn't really be too tough.
“We're aiming for a civil debate on the issues of the day. While it's fine to object to someone's ideas, we don't want commenters calling each other names – or insulting the authors of letters to the editor or the people quoted in our news stories.”
Easier said than done, as the editors of hundreds of publications have discovered. By 2014 or so, some started abandoning the concept. One of the first to go was – of all things – Popular Science, whose editors wrote that it was impossible for them to police the quack science that had begun infesting its website's comments.
By 2018, the trickle of websites ditching comments had become a torrent, and it included at least one other New Hampshire newspaper, the Union Leader, while a relatively small number of deep-pocketed ventures – the Boston Globe, the Washington Post and the New York Times among them – continue to maintain the practice, because they're in a position to do so.
It's too bad, really, that journalistic idealism – and that's what allowing public commenting started out as – had to give way to reality. But the online community includes its share of bullies, and they're instinctively drawn to places where, like spoiled children, they can strut their stuff with little or no intervention from the adults in the room.
That's reality. I feel bad for the very few Monitor commenters who struggled to maintain a civil dialogue. But I will not miss the bullies who drowned them out, and I suspect most readers feel the same.
And for those miscreants among them who are the first to prattle about their “free speech” being stomped on, you could do with a civics refreshment course. The treasured right of free speech has to do with interference in free expression on the part of our government.
Private enterprise – and that's what this newspaper is – doesn't owe you a thing.
(“Monitor” columnist Katy Burns lives in Bow.)

Texto completo: Headnote HBCU Commencement Round Up
More than 700 bachelor's candidates and 228 master's and doctoral candidates received their degrees at Morgan State University's (MSU's) jubilant 143rd Spring Commencement Exercises, which included a ceremony for undergraduates held on May 18, and a School of Graduate Studies ceremony on May 16. U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a member of Morgan's Board of Regents, was the guest speaker for the Undergraduate Ceremony held in Hughes Memorial Stadium on Morgan's campus, while across town in Baltimore City, the annual Preakness Day festivities were taking place. Retired New York Times sports columnist, journalist and author William C. Rhoden of Morgan's Class of 1973 received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters during the ceremony. More than 100 members of Morgan's Class of 1969 led the procession into the stadium and were honored as representatives of the 50th anniversary class, a day after the announcement of its $1.4 million in giving to the University in 2018, during Morgan's Alumni Day luncheon.
Morgan's Class of 2019 was rich with success stories reflecting the diversity which is one of the University's core values and a central part of its stated mission.

Texto completo: President is putting us into time of chaos Mr. Trump is calling on Americans to use the power of prayer to end violence. I find this quite humorous since as the top official of the United States, he does more to incite violence than anyone else.
The hatred and violence that is erupting in our country, and the inequality in our justice system is appalling. Mr. Trump says he has done more than any other president. Hmmm, he has managed to introduce white nationalism into the White House and is quite vocal about it; has managed to bring our country down in the eyes of our patriotic citizens and our allies; is managing to bring our country back in time rather than going forward and is ignoring all scientific research on climate change because he knows more than any of the scientists.
He has absolutely no interest in saving our planet for future generations. He wants to bypass congress and go to war with Iran. Now he has the audacity to say he wants to bring those that "spied" on his campaign up for treason and sent to jail. This coming from someone who values Putin’s input over his own advisers.
I cannot think of anyone else that has committed so many acts of obstruction of justice and is getting away with it. We want Congress to act, but then how can they when McConnell, Trump and Barr cut them down every time they can, including telling folks to just ignore the subpoenas they receive?
How is this even possible!
I now realize we are under a dictator who wants nothing more than chaos. If we don’t stop this at the polls, prayer will not help. We are living in very frightening times. Every time I see him raise his right hand in a fist all I can think of is Hitler. Scary folks, very scary.
Sandra Alter Hoffman Estates Barr’s curious comments about judges It was interesting to read William Barr’s comments regarding federal judges and some of their rulings in cases where Trump’s commands were blocked. He took umbrage at the fact that a single judge could block the president’s policies.
I guess it never occurred to Mr. Barr that the president could have proposed policies that addressed the concerns of all Americans. And it didn’t seem to occur to Mr. Barr that he took it upon himself to shape public opinion regarding the Mueller investigation without even a second thought as to what it would do to the public’s confidence in the judiciary system.
Mr. Barr should just accept the fact that once all the arguments were made in the cases, the "baby" then belonged to the judges. It was heartening, though, to see that Mr. Barr is very intelligent when he figured out that the 37 blocked attempts since Trump took office were more than one a month.
Tom Frampton Streamwood Commentaries seek to set up Democrats Taking credit when things go well and blaming someone else when things go poorly isn’t new to Donald Trump. It has long been a part of the conservative playbook, long enough to be honed into an art.
Recently the Daily Herald had a conservative columnist, Byron York, who wrote, "Amid good news can Democrats talk down the economy" and on May 14, the paper published a cartoon that shows the Democratic national headquarters talking about hiring the 3.6% unemployed to trash talk the economy.
Putting aside the stupidity of the concept of creating full employment to trash an economy, it is obvious that they are both setting the stage to blame Democrats when the economy turns down.
In Mr. York’s column he quotes an economic reporter, a columnist, an economic adviser, a financial reporter, and two Republican strategists. Nothing from a Democratic politician or official.
Grabbing Mr. York’s lead, the cartoonist feels free to suggest Democratic officials without naming names or indicating a basis for the observation.
There is no doubt that given time, the economy will hit a slump. How fast and how hard will depend on many factors, including fiscal and social policies and legislation. But to suggest that the Democrats are trashing the economy when the Republicans control so much of our government is weak intellectually and lazy artistically.
Mike Vandeleur Bolingbrook Dog-and-pony show The Daily Herald’s May 9 headline "Trump formally blocks report" is quite misleading. According to the New York Times, what was blocked (redacted) from Mueller’s report is: 69% dealing with ongoing investigations, 18% grand jury testimony that cannot legally be released, 8% classified material and 5% that would infringe on personal privacy rights.
The Justice Department offered 12 congressional leaders — party leaders and the heads of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees — and a staff member each the ability to view a version of the Mueller report that only contained redactions of grand jury material, which the Justice Department has argued it is prohibited by law from sharing without a court order.
While no Democrat has taken the opportunity, six Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham have taken up the offer, along with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Doug Collins, Need more proof that Nadler is running a dog-and-pony show?
Joan Baillie Volo Testing teachers I am a retired teacher. I had contact with teachers who should not have been in a classroom. Now the state is looking to eliminate the Basic Skills test for certification. A fourth grader could pass that test. If a person cannot pass a basic skills test, do you want that person teaching your child?
Doris Aussin Lake in the Hills Vigilance needed to control spending With one week left in Springfield’s regular legislative session, the wheels are spinning. Madigan’s supermajority wants new gas, gambling and pot taxes; will increase property taxes through unfunded local school mandates; and will escalate fees. Notwithstanding the May 31 budget deadline, no proposed budget bill exists, because proposed new spending requires billions of new taxes.
The proposed "graduated" income tax amendment to eliminate the Illinois Constitution’s equal tax treatment has an army of tax lobbyists salivating over opportunities to grease connected insiders’ wheels.
Utterly missing from the debate are bipartisan proposals to amend the Illinois Constitution to reform and restructure what drives the structural deficits: the Illinois pension system.
There is some hope — federal reforms improved our state tax base, generating $1.5 billion dollars in extra revenue for this fiscal year. The governor was rightly pressured by stakeholders on both sides of the aisle to abandon his plan to short the teacher, police and firefighter pensions this year. That doesn’t mean he won’t try again next year.
Illinois’ Department of Revenue estimates $800 million more will arrive in the next fiscal year.
I urged fellow legislators to try something new under the dome: control spending, not raise taxes; and encourage natural economic growth to help balance our budget.
We know the way; we just need the will. We must be vigilant to advocate and insist that the state use all newfound revenues to dig Illinois out of its fiscal hole. Please call our office to learn how you can help.

Texto completo: Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the immigration hard-liner who was expected to be President Trump's pick to coordinate immigration policy, will instead be chosen to take over for the embattled official who has overseen the legal immigration system, according to two people briefed on the situation.
The official, L. Francis Cissna, whose role as the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has included overseeing a visa system that many White House aides view as broken, has submitted to pressure to step down, the two people said.
Mr. Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general, is expected to be tapped to replace Mr. Cissna, the two people said. Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Cuccinelli in recent days to help coordinate policy across agencies, akin to the "immigration czar" job that the president has considered creating for months. The move startled officials at the White House and at the Department of Homeland Security, where one West Wing official said Mr. Cuccinelli would work.
For now, he will be used to move out Mr. Cissna, the people familiar with the move said.
But Mr. Cissna, who was supported by a number of immigration restrictionists, held a Senate-confirmed role. And people close to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who has been a target of Mr. Cuccinelli's in the past, said that the former attorney general's chances of being confirmed were close to zero, creating immediate questions about the next steps in the process.
Mr. Cissna's resignation was previously reported by The Washington Post. The White House declined to comment.
The latest twist in the Trump administration's personnel decisions related to immigration shows that it has become one of the most battle-scarred areas of internal turf in the past several months. Over the past several weeks, Mr. Trump has sought to shake up the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, beginning with ousting Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in April.
The New York Times reported that month that Mr. Cissna could also be forced out, and officials in the White House have long seen him as a hindrance, particularly Mr. Trump's top policy adviser, Stephen Miller, whose singular focus is immigration. But a number of immigration restrictionists who have sought for years to reduce legal immigration described Mr. Cissna as a reliable partner. He was also supported by prominent Republicans like Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.
Ultimately, it was not enough to keep him in his job.
Mr. Cuccinelli, however, faces a likely insurmountable obstacle in Mr. McConnell. Mr. Cuccinelli in 2014 was part of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee that supported a primary challenge to Mr. McConnell.
A person close to the senator said on Friday that Mr. Cuccinelli would not make it through the confirmation process.
Even if he is not confirmed, Mr. Cuccinelli is expected to be kept on at the Department of Homeland Security in some fashion.

New York state could outlaw racial discrimination based on hair

Texto completo: ALBANY – New York would become one of the first states to outlaw racial discrimination based on natural hair and hairstyles like braids, twists and dreadlocks under a bill introduced at the state Capitol.
The proposal from state Sen. Jamaal Bailey, D-Bronx, and Assemblywoman Tremaine Wright, D-Brooklyn, would make clear employers and schools can't discriminate on the basis of someone's hairstyle if it is "historically associated with race."
Practically speaking, the bill would prevent employers and schools from requiring their black employees or students to straighten their hair or setting a dress code that prevents braids, dreadlocks or similar hairstyles.
Bailey said the bill is about ensuring "people of color and their cultural choices are protected and supported."
"Hair is a part of you," Bailey said Friday. "It's something that is innately part of your being, and being able to express yourself through your hair and how you choose to wear your hair should not be something that someone can discriminate against you for."
The bill was introduced three months after New York City's Commission on Human Rights issued guidelines preventing discrimination based on hair and a month after the California Senate approved a similar measure.
As it stands, New York state law prevents employer discrimination based on a variety of traits, including age, race, creed, sex and color.
Bill would expand definition of 'race' Wright and Bailey's bill, which was introduced Thursday, would expand the legal definition of race to include "ancestry, color, ethnic group identification and ethnic background," including any "traits historically associated with race" such as "hair texture and protective hairstyles."
Examples of "protective hairstyles" are braids, locks and twists, among others, according to the bill.
The same definition would also be added to the state Dignity For All Students act, which deals with bullying in schools.
The proposal is similar to a measure approved unanimously by the California Senate on April 22.
That measure is awaiting a vote in the California Assembly.
NYC acted in February New York City, meanwhile, took the action unilaterally.
The city Commission on Human Rights changing its guidelines in February to make clear city residents have the right to "natural hair, treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed state," according to The New York Times.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose wife, Chirlane, is black, said his relationship with his wife, dating back to the early 1990s, "began my education on the question of hair."
"You know, she told me many, many stories of people, particularly women, being looked down on because they had natural hair, or because they had dreadlocks, or whatever it may be," de Blasio said in February. "And it's appalling to me that that ever went on, but it still goes on to this day."
De Blasio continued: "It's not acceptable. It must end, and we're going to lead the way here in New York City."
Bailey said he's hopeful his bill will get some consideration before state lawmakers end their annual session in mid-June.
"I think we can stand to learn a thing or two from the city of New York and how they apply their human-rights law," he said.

New York is considering a bill that would explicitly ban racial discrimination based on natural hairstyle such as braids, bantu knots and locks.

It'll take more than sanctions to topple regime in Iran

Texto completo: President Trump's Iran policy appears to be careening between diplomacy and belligerence. One day Trump tweets, "I'm sure that Iran will want to talk soon." The next he warns that "if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran." Confused? Well, there is a method to the madness.
The Trump administration understands that Iran doesn't want war because Iran knows it will lose. That's why Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made clear via a government Twitter account "no war is to happen."
Trump's goal is not to start a war. His administration has three objectives: First, restore deterrence and contain Iran's expansionism across the Middle East. Second, roll back Iran's gains and force it back within its borders. And third, give Iran's leaders a clear choice: They can come to the negotiating table and give up their nuclear and missile ambitions -- or their regime can implode, just like the Soviet Union.
When Trump came into office, Iran was on the march across the Middle East -- in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen -- thanks in part to the massive infusions of cash it received from sanctions relief under President Barack Obama's Iran deal. Trump did not simply restore sanctions imposed before the deal; he ramped them up to unprecedented levels. The sanctions have already "wiped $10 billion from Iranian revenue since November," The Washington Post reported, citing administration officials.
This month, the administration tightened the screws even further, eliminating waivers for eight countries that had previously been allowed to continue importing Iranian oil. The goal, according to American officials, is to reduce Iranian oil exports to "zero." It's working. Bloomberg News reports that "Iran's oil shipments tumbled this month after the U.S. ended sanctions waivers. ... So far, not a single ship has been seen leaving Iran's oil terminals for foreign ports."
The new sanctions are forcing Tehran to cut funds to its terrorist proxies. According to The Post, "Iran's ability to finance allies such as Hezbollah has been curtailed," while in Lebanon, The New York Times reports, "Syrian militiamen paid by Iran have seen their salaries slashed." On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that "Iran's proposed defense budget has been reduced by 25 percent and the (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps') proposed budget by about 10 percent."
Iran is obviously unhappy with this, and U.S. intelligence saw signs that Iran was preparing to respond with attacks on Americans using terrorist proxies -- just as they did in the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks bombing and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, and by supplying Shiite militias in Iraq with armor-penetrating roadside bombs that killed hundreds of American soldiers.
So the Trump administration delivered a clear message that America will hold Iran directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, even if they are carried out by surrogates -- and offered a show of force to back those threats -- providing clarity that makes it less likely Iranian leaders will miscalculate.
Sanctions are inflicting major pain. But if the goal is to roll back Iran's expansionism, then sanctions alone are not enough. We must also aggressively confront Iran throughout the region, building up our allies inflicting defeats on Iran in critical theaters, just as President Ronald Reagan did to the Soviets. A major drawdown of U.S. forces in Syria is incompatible with a "maximum pressure" approach.
Will Iranian leaders come to the table? Far less draconian sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table under Obama. But Trump has rightly paired tougher sanctions with tougher demands. Pompeo has laid out 12 requirements for a deal with Iran -- including an end to support for Middle East terrorist groups and a complete withdrawal from Syria -- that Iran is unlikely to meet.
If they don't come to the table, then what is our strategy? Does Trump really want to bring about the collapse of the Iranian regime? It's not clear. If he does, then, as my American Enterprise Institute colleague Frederick W. Kagan points out, this task may be even harder than it was with the Soviet Union. As North Korea has shown, tyrannical regimes can survive even crippling sanctions. Certainly, the world will be better if Iran is focused on survival rather than expansion and terror. But it will take more than sanctions to leave the Iranian regime on the ash heap of history. That requires a strategy.

Texto completo: It's not easy keeping up with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's shifting position on the conduct of President Donald Trump. But at least for the moment the California Democrat seems to be in agreement with Attorney General William Barr on a key question regarding our co-equal branches of government.
As for Mr. Trump, yesterday Speaker Pelosi said that the President was obstructing justice and engaging in a cover-up. She never explained exactly what he was allegedly covering up or how he was allegedly obstructing justice.
Perhaps she has no explanation, which may be why today she was observed on Capitol Hill backpedaling at a speed that would make Stephon Gilmore jealous. The Journal's Natalie Andrews and Rebecca Ballhaus report :
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said House Democrats aren't moving to impeach President Trump, but cautioned the findings of congressional investigations probing the president's conduct could change their stance.
The current investigations "may take us to a place that is unavoidable in terms of impeachment, or not, but we're not at that place," Mrs. Pelosi told reporters Thursday.
This would seem to warrant a retraction of her Wednesday remarks, but the President has probably learned by now not to expect too much in the way of congressional courtesy.
As for the courtesy Mrs. Pelosi is extending to Mr. Barr, the evidence comes courtesy of the New York Times. Peter Baker, Katie Rogers and Emily Cochrane report :
President Trump abruptly blew up a meeting with Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday, declaring that he could not work with them until they stopped investigating him and lashing out at Speaker Nancy Pelosi for accusing him of a cover-up...
After Mr. Trump walked out, Ms. Pelosi turned to other Democrats there and recounted a story about how Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt had each brought people together to solve infrastructure problems.
"I knew he was looking for a way out," Ms. Pelosi concluded. "We were expecting this."
Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, was in the room. "Respectfully, Madam Speaker," she asked, "do you have a direct response to the president?"
Ms. Pelosi said she was responding to the president, not members of his staff.
"Really great," Ms. Conway replied sarcastically. "That's really pro-woman of you."
This column thinks that Mrs. Pelosi might have benefited from a conversation with the President's clever counselor. But as the duly elected Speaker of the House, the California lawmaker is free to insist on dealing directly with the principal executive. Constitutionally, Mrs. Pelosi does not answer to the White House staff. She is a leader of the legislative branch, which is not inferior to the executive.
Similarly, the Attorney General of the United States is not inferior to the lawyers who work on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee. Earlier this month, Mrs. Pelosi's Democratic colleagues attempted to set a precedent. The National Law Journal reported on May 1:
In preparation for a Thursday hearing with Barr, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to allow Republican and Democratic staff to question the attorney general. It was just the move the Justice Department warned would deter Barr from appearing. Hours after his Senate testimony, Barr announced he wouldn't be showing up Thursday.
In a statement, a Justice Department spokesperson described the conditions set by the committee's chairman, U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, as "unprecedented and unnecessary."
"Congress and the executive branch are co-equal branches of government, and each have a constitutional obligation to respect and accommodate one another's legitimate interests. Chairman Nadler's insistence on having staff question the attorney general, a Senate-confirmed cabinet member, is inappropriate," Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. "Further, in light of the fact that the majority of the House Judiciary Committee—including Chairman Nadler—are themselves attorneys, and the chairman has the ability and authority to fashion the hearing in a way that allows for efficient and thorough questioning by the members themselves, the chairman's request is also unnecessary."
More recently, Journal reader Greg Woods wrote in a letter to the editor:
Imagine for a moment that the House invites the leadership of the Senate over to discuss pending legislation. When the senators arrive, they find only staff waiting for them. They would no doubt walk out the door in a huff. The way Congress acknowledges that the executive branch is a coequal branch is by following this simple rule: staff meets with staff, and principals meet with principals.
Rep. Nadler's violation of this rule isn't just an insult to Bill Barr, it is a constitutional insult to the Office of the Attorney General, implying that Congress has supremacy over the executive branch. If, when Mr. Barr does meet with the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Nadler allows a staff member to ask questions, Mr. Barr should direct a member of his staff to replace him at the table and direct that staff member to answer each question with: "I am not authorized by the attorney general to answer that question."
Disappointed as Mrs. Conway surely was at not being able to enjoy a conversation with Mrs. Pelosi, the President's counselor was no doubt gratified to hear that the Speaker agrees with the executive branch on an important principle.

CANNES FILM FESTIVAL; 'I just reject your hypothesis,' says director; Tarantino becomes testy when asked about women and Roman Polanski.

Texto completo: There were plenty of hard questions Quentin Tarantino could have faced as he greeted reporters for the first time following the Cannes premiere of "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood."
Did he change his approach to on-set safety after Uma Thurman alleged in February 2018 that the director pushed her to perform a "Kill Bill" stunt that left her permanently injured? Why did he cast Emile Hirsch, who pleaded guilty to assaulting a female executive in 2015, in his new film? Does he have any response to Rose McGowan's claims, published in her 2018 memoir, that he repeatedly and publicly spoke about masturbating to her feet in the movie "Jawbreaker"?
In his latest film, why does Leonardo DiCaprio's character idolize Roman Polanski, whose 1977 rape charge Tarantino once defended by deeming it "statutory rape," saying that the teenage victim willingly participated.

But Tarantino avoided nearly all of those lines of inquiry at the film's news conference here Wednesday afternoon. The most contentious moment during the question-and-answer session came when a female journalist from the New York Times asked the filmmaker why he gave a talented actress such as Margot Robbie, who plays Sharon Tate in the late-'60s Hollywood period piece, such little dialogue.
"I just reject your hypothesis," Tarantino said bluntly, a scowl on his face.
Robbie jumped in to defend the director, saying she felt the moments she had on screen honored the "lightness" she had always heard Tate embodied.
"I don't think it was intended to delve deeper," the Oscar-nominated actress said. "I think the tragedy, ultimately, was the loss of innocence. To show those wonderful sides of her could ultimately be done without speaking. ... I got a lot of time to explore the character even without speaking. Rarely do I get to spend so much time on my own as a character. That was actually an interesting thing for me to do as an actor."
"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," which debuted to largely positive reviews Tuesday evening, stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a western star struggling to maintain his relevance in the movie business.
He relies on his best friend and stuntman, Brad Pitt, to boost his confidence and help out around the house -- a Benedict Canyon mansion that just happens to be next to Polanski and Tate's home. As they drive around Hollywood, to and from studio lots, the men eventually cross paths with a bunch of young hippies who turn out to be disciples of sociopath Charles Manson.
Despite the setting, Pitt said he didn't see the film as a depiction of rage against women.
"I don't see it as a rage against individuals -- I see it as a rage against a loss of innocence," said the actor. "That time, 1969, when the Manson murders occurred was a time -- building up to that, there was the free love movement. There was a lot of hope. ... And when that event happened, and the tragic loss of Sharon and others, what scares people and why it lasts so much today, I think, was because it was a sobering, dark look at the dark side of human nature."
The only other difficult question the cast and crew faced was about Polanski. In February, Tarantino publicly apologized to Samantha Geimer for making "cavalier remarks" about her 1977 rape charge against the Polish director. So when he was asked Wednesday about why DiCaprio's character believes Polanski is "the greatest filmmaker alive," Tarantino chose his words carefully.
"He doesn't really talk about him as the greatest filmmaker alive, he talks about him as the hottest filmmaker alive," he said, referring to the amount of money "Rosemary's Baby" grossed in 1968. "I'm a fan of Roman Polanski's work, but in particular 'Rosemary's Baby.' I like that a lot."
Tarantino said he had met Polanski a "couple of times," but did not consult with the director about his portrayal in "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood."
Because the characters in Tarantino's film are taking stock of their lives, one journalist asked the group to reflect on their own journey.
"I can honestly say that my taking stock is different than it would have been three years ago, or four years ago, or even 10 years ago, because I just got married six months ago," Tarantino said, pointing to his wife, the Israeli singer Daniela Pick.
"And I've never done that before, and now I know why. I was waiting for the perfect girl," he added. "So frankly, to tell you the truth, my taking stock is happening right now."
The remainder of the press conference involved the team talking about whether they would prefer to live now or in the '60s and DiCaprio and Pitt exuberantly discussing what it was like to collaborate for the first time.
"It's that thing of knowing you've got the best of the best on the opposite side of the table holding up the scene with you," Pitt said. "We have the same reference points. We've been going through this at the same time and have similar experiences to laugh about, and I hope we get to do it again."

Texto completo: Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams told a crowd on Wednesday that "we won" the race, which resulted in Republican Brian Kemp becoming the state's governor, through identity politics.
"The notion of identity politics has been peddled for the last 10 years, and it’s been used as a dog whistle to say that we shouldn’t pay too much attention to the new voices coming into progress," Abrams said at the CAP Ideas Conference, put on by liberal think tank Center for American Progress.
"I would argue that identity politics is exactly who we are and it’s exactly how we won. By centering communities in Georgia, we not only increased voter participation, we brought new folks to the process," she said.
Abrams said if politicians do not engage in identity politics, then voters will feel alienated because they will see it as them refusing to acknowledge the barriers marginalized people face on a daily basis.
Abrams lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Kemp by about 55,000 votes, according to the New York Times.

Texto completo: As several states, including Alabama and Georgia, move to restrict abortion, here are three novels that explore the wide range of perspectives on the issue -- from evangelicals, abortion providers, women with unwanted pregnancies and more.
RED CLOCKS
By Leni Zumas
356 pp. Little, Brown & Company. (2018)
This book follows four women in the near future, living in a small town in Oregon and grappling with new federal laws that have outlawed abortion and where single women are on the verge of being denied the right to adopt. Our reviewer called it a "lyrical and beautifully observed reflection on women's lives," adding that it offers "such a clear and well-constructed extrapolation of the current debate that I doubt any reader will need to suspend disbelief for even a moment."
A SPARK OF LIGHT
By Jodi Picoult
384 pp. Ballantine. (2018)
In Picoult's most recent best seller, a routine day at a women's reproductive health clinic turns tragic when a gunman opens fire and takes everyone inside hostage. The hostages include a 15-year-old girl named Wren, whose father ends up being the police hostage negotiator on the scene; an anti-abortion protester disguised as a patient; a nurse and a doctor; and a young woman who was there to get an abortion. It is told in reverse chronological order, giving insight into what brought these characters to the clinic.
A BOOK OF AMERICAN MARTYRS
By Joyce Carol Oates
736 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. (2017)
This story begins with a death: The evangelical Luther Dunphy shoots and kills Dr. Augustus Voorhees, an abortion provider, and their families are left to reckon with the aftermath. "America's abortion war contains treacherous depths, and to Oates's credit her book seeks to plumb them," our reviewer wrote. "How, it asks, might we humanize extreme ideological positions? How might we subvert the divisiveness that so troubles the debate?" Through a menagerie of characters, Oates tackles these questions.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The story started, like a lot of stories seem to, with President Trump's former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen.
On April 9, 2018, the F.B.I. raided Mr. Cohen's office, thrusting him into the national spotlight. The next day, the top editors at The New York Times asked five reporters to start working on a profile. I was one of them.
The other reporters researched Mr. Cohen's family, his legal career, his real estate interests and, of course, his work for the president. I took on the last piece of his business empire: his ownership of 30 New York taxi medallions, the coveted permits needed to own a yellow cab.
After a few weeks of reporting, the team learned enough to publish our story on Mr. Cohen. And I discovered enough to know what I wanted to investigate next.
At that time, the taxi industry was becoming a big story. Mr. Cohen had owned his medallions as an investment, counting on them rising in value because of the city's decision to issue only about 13,000 permits. But thousands of the medallions were owned by drivers themselves, and two driver-owners had just died by suicide. Public officials were talking about how the price of a medallion had plummeted from over $ 1 million to under $ 150,000. Most were blaming ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft.
I had a different question: Why had anybody ever paid $ 1 million for the right to the grueling job of being a cabby?
When I pursue an investigation, I identify the single most important question that I am trying to answer, and orient all of my reporting around it. (For example, why did it cost more to build subway track in New York than anywhere else in the world? Or why did Texas have the lowest special education rate in the country?) In this case, I ended up interviewing about 450 people, and I asked almost all the same question: Why did the price reach $ 1 million? It became my North Star.
I heard plenty of theories, but I began to get somewhere only when I had an epiphany: No driver-owner had ever really paid close to $ 1 million for a medallion. On paper, thousands of low-income immigrants had. But while they had poured their life savings into their purchase, virtually all had signed loans for most of the cost -- and never really had a chance to repay.
I needed to examine as many loans as possible, to see if they were as unusual and reckless -- and predatory -- as some of my sources said they were. But how?
I got a lead from an unexpected source: the lenders themselves.
After prices had started crashing, the lenders in the industry had tried to squeeze money out of borrowers. Many of them had filed lawsuits against borrowers lawsuits, which had to include copies of the loans.
I ultimately reviewed 500 of these loans, and I saw disturbing patterns: Almost none of them included a large down payment. Almost all of them required the borrower to repay everything within three years, which was impossible. There were a lot of interest-only loans, and a wide variety of fees, including charges for paying loans off too early. Many of the loans required borrowers to sign away their legal rights.
Armed with the loan documents, I started calling dozens of current and former industry bankers, brokers, lawyers and investors. Some pointed me to disclosures that lenders had filed with the government, which were enormously helpful. Others shared internal records, which were even better.
New York City did not have reliable digital data on medallion sales, so I used paper records to build a database of all the 10,888 sales between 1995 and 2018. The city taxi commission had never analyzed the financial records submitted by medallion buyers, so I did. Nobody knew how many medallion owners had gone bankrupt because of the crisis, so I convinced my boss to pay a technology company, Epiq, to create a program that sped through court records and spat out a tentative list -- and then two news assistants helped me verify every result.
As I dug into the data and the documents, I sought out driver-owners. I wanted to understand what they had been through. To find them, I went to Kennedy International Airport.
The fare from taking someone from the airport into Manhattan can make a cabby's day, and so drivers wait in line for hours. And over several visits during a couple of months, I waited with them, striking up conversations outside a food stand run by a Greek family and next to pay phones that had stopped working years ago. After talking briefly, I asked if I could visit their homes and meet their friends.
In all, I met 200 taxi drivers, including several I interviewed through translators because they did not speak English fluently. (Some of those men still had signed loans of up to $ 1 million.) One by one, they told me how they had come to New York seeking the American dream, worked hard and gotten trapped in loans they did not understand, which often made them give up almost all of their monthly income. Several said that after the medallion bubble burst, wiping out their savings and their futures, they had contemplated suicide. One said he had already attempted it.
The day after we began publishing our findings, city officials announced they were exploring ways to help these driver-owners, and the mayor and state attorney general said they were going to investigate the people who channeled them into the loans.
In the end, the three front-page stories that we published this week about the taxi industry barely mentioned Mr. Cohen at all.
But they did something much more important: They told the stories of Mohammed Hoque, of Jean Demosthenes and of Wael Ghobrayal.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
A TALE OF TWO KITCHENS (2019) Stream on Netflix. Gabriela Cámara, the influential chef whose restaurants include Contramar in Mexico City and Cala in San Francisco, connected disparate parts of Mexico by bringing fresh coastal seafood to the landlocked Mexico City when Contramar opened in 1998. This short documentary, directed by Trisha Ziff, connects the Mexico City and San Francisco restaurants -- and the cities themselves -- by showing the day-to-day life in each, and speaking to some of the cooks and other staff who keep both running.
RASHOMON (1951) Stream on Kanopy; Rent on Amazon and iTunes. The Japanese actress Machiko Kyo died last week at the age of 95, bringing renewed attention to this breakout thriller from the revered director Akira Kurosawa. Kyo stars as the wife of a dead samurai. The plot presents four contradictory accounts of the circumstances surrounding the killing. When the film was shown at the Venice Film Festival in 1951, it was given the festival's top prize, the Golden Lion. "Immediately, the film and its maker became international sensations," the critic Phillip Lopate wrote in The New York Times in 2016. "It is easy to see why," Lopate added.
12 STRONG (2018) Stream on HBO platforms. Horses grunt alongside the human warriors in "12 Strong," an Afghanistan-set war movie with Chris Hemsworth and two famous Michaels: Shannon and Peña. The actors play American soldiers who join forces with an Afghani warlord (Navid Negahban) to fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, in a story based on the nonfiction book "Horse Soldiers" by Doug Stanton. "For devotees of cinematic blowouts and dedicated students of screen masculinity (like me), '12 Strong' is premium, Grade A catnip," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "Directed by the newcomer Nicolai Fuglsig, it is generally watchable, if unsurprisingly easier on the eyes than on the ears or brain."
What's on TV
THE WRESTLERS 10 p.m. on Viceland. The Canadian punk musician Damian Abraham hosts this globe-trotting new series, which centers not on music but on wrestling, diving into the different scenes worldwide. "As a lifelong wrestling fan, I've always felt there's more to wrestling than just choreographed violence," Abraham says in the introduction. "At the core of every wrestler, there is a storyteller, every ring a stage to reflect the struggles of its audience -- whether it be gender, sexuality, race, religion or class." Wednesday night's episode follows the professional wrestling promoter Gabe Sapolsky on a tour of the United States. Later episodes will move out of the country, to focus on wrestling in Japan, Mexico and central Africa.
LIVE IN FRONT OF A STUDIO AUDIENCE: NORMAN LEAR'S 'ALL IN THE FAMILY' AND 'THE JEFFERSONS' 8 p.m. on ABC. Norman Lear helped define the American sitcom through developing "All in the Family" and "The Jeffersons," among others. The 96-year-old Lear teams up with Jimmy Kimmel to host this tribute to those two shows, which features celebrities like Woody Harrelson, Marisa Tomei, Jamie Foxx and Wanda Sykes in live re-creations.

Texto completo: In hindsight, Bruce Fleming says, the Speedo photo was open to misinterpretation.
The English professor and ex-model sent his youthful glamour shot to midshipmen in an all-male class at the U.S. Naval Academy. Fleming says he tried to make relevant the 200-year-old poem "Ode on a Grecian Urn" and the theme of reality vs. an ideal. Instead, the photo became evidence for Navy commanders to finally fire the longtime, civilian rabble-rouser.
Fleming, 64, will argue for reinstatement before an administrative judge in Philadelphia on Wednesday. His appeal brings to a head the classroom rebellion he's waged over his 31 years at the academy.
"All these kids, they learn just bowing their heads and saying, 'Yes, sir.' That kills me because I spent my life not bowing," Fleming said. "The way you get an effective military is to get young officers who are not afraid to question what they've been told."
The academic dean found Fleming guilty of "conduct unbecoming a federal employee," citing a pattern of profane and unnerving behavior that flouted the personal boundaries of his students.
In the buttoned-up Annapolis institution, the tenured professor has long reveled in his role of iconoclast. Fleming is the one who will show up to class dressed like Capt. von Trapp from "The Sound of Music," who starts the semester with a demonstration of one-armed pushups, who gives a famous lecture on the merits of sunscreen, dental floss and the application of a condom.
"I've had a kid say to me, 'Oh, well, sir, you put it on halfway through,' " he said.
The senior professor - with a wife, three children and a salary of $130,000 a year - was fired nine months ago. In his class, nothing was off-limits. Not his gay brother who died of AIDS. Not a boyhood friend who went to Canada to become a woman. Not the length of the prom dress worn by the date of his teenage son.
Of course, his "life advice" digressions included some milder themes: never take steroids, avoid fattening food in King Hall. But Fleming didn't shy away from profanity or sex talk. He's the English professor who broke down the origins of the colloquialism "that sucks." To administrators and some midshipmen, he goes too far.
"One day in class, the period was taken up by Professor Fleming going into extreme detail regarding sexual transitions to other genders," a midshipman wrote the dean. "I tear up thinking about the thousands of Midshipmen who had to endure the constant abuse, attacks and detrimental conduct ... knowing that more Midshipmen will have those experiences in the future makes me sick."
Since 2013, administrators twice sent Fleming for counseling and issued him two letters of reprimand. Fleming sent a shirtless photo of himself to students in 2015 and again two years later, Academic Dean and Provost Andrew Phillips wrote.
"It is apparent that you do not find any aspect of your behavior to be inappropriate," Phillips wrote in the August 2018 letter. "You offer no intention to alter any aspect of your behavior."
Academy officials declined through a spokeswoman to discuss Fleming's case.
The professor says his firing comes at a chilling age for free speech on campuses. Violent protests erupted two years ago at University California, Berkeley in advance of a visit by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. Two weeks ago, Harvard University announced it would not permit a law professor and attorney for Harvey Weinstein to continue leading an undergraduate dorm where students had protested.
With conservative speakers saying their voices are being silenced on campuses, President Donald Trump said he will order colleges to support free speech if they want federal funding.
The Naval Academy, Fleming notes, is largely conservative, white and male.
"I'm being painted as a crazy left-winger who talks about sex-change operations," he said. "I hope we outlive all this political correctness."
An Eastern Shore native and the son of two Salisbury University professors, Fleming studied philosophy at Haverford College outside Philadelphia. Graduate studies led him to The University of Chicago, briefly, then Vanderbilt University. He says he was a Fulbright scholar in West Berlin and taught in Rwanda before arriving in Annapolis in 1987.
An admitted "gym rat," he found the Naval Academy - with its mission to develop midshipmen morally, mentally and physically - in accord with his own belief in the Greek ideal of a healthy mind and body. Here was a challenge: Not one of his students would ever be an English teacher.
"I went to a Quaker college, for God's sake," he said. "These people are trained to be killers."
Over the next three decades, he taught Sophocles, Shakespeare and Keats to uninterested first-year midshipmen. Typically small-town teens, Fleming says, who grew up on Rambo movies and came to Annapolis to become real men. No one slept in Fleming's class.
The former model - "I'm totally into clothes" - wore $3,000 suits, he says, and an Egyptian galabeya tunic. Midshipmen tried on his jackets. He held "Joke Fridays."
Fleming offered up one former student who graduated from the Naval Academy in 1997 and works for the U.S. Department of Justice. David Ausiello said Fleming actually cared.
"Bruce Fleming's class was like therapy," Ausiello said, "a place where you weren't going to get told how great you were or how the world is black and white, because that just wasn't the reality. He fostered an environment that encouraged his students to challenge the norms, ask why when appropriate, and be comfortable operating in the gray areas."
The professor earned performance rewards in the 1990s. As years went by, his criticism of the academy grew louder. By 2009, he was telling a CNN reporter that admissions standards were weakening. In a 2010 op-ed in The New York Times, he wrote the Naval Academy "lost its way." He called it a "military Disneyland, beloved by tourists but disillusioning to the young people who came hoping to make a difference."
He blasted the academy on C-SPAN, in his own books and in The Atlantic. Meanwhile, his theatrical teaching methods raised eyebrows. Students seemed to have the attention span of a goldfish, he told them. Fleming signed emails, "Glub, glub."
The military requires the conformity of a herd, he said; he called his students "midsheeple." According to the investigation report, he called their laptops "porn machines."
In a September 2017 email, he called two students his "right-wing extremists" and faulted them for failing to support arguments in papers on guns and taxes. "This is not a left-right thing," he wrote them, "it's a justify that thing."
A midshipman complained and administrators began an investigation. They gathered more than 100 pages of comments from midshipmen. Students reported their professor was frank and graphic in discussing sex acts. One wrote that Fleming's disdain for the academy felt excessive. Another wrote that Fleming removed his shoes and walked on a midshipman's back to crack it. Some said they were unnerved by his hugs. Some found his blunt talk refreshing; others, sickening.
Fleming draws a distinction between sexuality and physicality. He sent them the famous 1992 Calvin Klein underwear ad featuring Mark Wahlberg. He says it too was part of his lesson on the impermanence of beauty.
In August 2018, the dean found Fleming's conduct unbecoming and fired him. He has appealed to the board that hears federal employment cases, the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board. Fleming and his attorney will make their case to an administrative judge over two days in Philadelphia.
He's hoping the judge will understand what he says the academy's leadership seems to miss: That his antics are designed to get students to think for themselves, even if that means going a little overboard.
He also teaches "The Charge of the Light Brigade," the enduring poem about a suicidal order to charge forward in overwhelming odds.
The poet Alfred Lord Tennyson tells of glory in their death; Fleming doesn't.
"I say to the students, 'Don't follow the order.'"

LAWSUIT CLAIMS PRIZED TOMATOES ARE IMPOSTERS

Texto completo: They are some of the world's most prized tomatoes, beloved by chefs for their low acidity and brilliant red color, the key to great Italian sauces, the products of rich volcanic soil in the coastal fields around Mount Vesuvius.
That's the allure of San Marzano tomatoes. But a new lawsuit alleges that one of America's most popular brands of the canned tomatoes aren't true San Marzanos at all they're impostors, slapping the revered name onto lesser tomatoes to command a higher price tag.
The suit, filed by three Northern California home cooks in federal court last week, accuses the New Jersey food company Cento of "false, misleading and deceptive advertising" on cans labeled as San Marzano tomatoes. It seeks to create a class of consumers that could include thousands of people nationwide who have bought the tomatoes, claiming that those customers are entitled to relief because the tomatoes are not true San Marzanos and shoppers would not have paid a premium if they had known the truth.
Cento strongly denied the lawsuit's allegations, saying that its tomatoes are true San Marzanos and that the suit's claims are "unfounded" and "frivolous."
This isn't the first time the legitimacy of the Sam Marzano tomatoes on American grocery store shelves has been questioned. The online food magazine TASTE described the tomato variety in a 2017 article as "the fake Rolex of canned foods," citing comments from an Italian official that at most, 5 percent of the tomatoes marketed as San Marzanos in the United States were legitimate. The New York Times reported in 2015 that some companies sold American-grown tomatoes as San Marzanos, and that Italian authorities "regularly seize" cans of counterfeit tomatoes.
The reason is in part the almost mythical reputation the meaty, oblong plum tomatoes enjoy in the food world, as well as the high standards of the San Marzano title.
Think of the tomatoes like Champagne, which must come from the eponymous region in France to be worthy of the name: One of many Italian standards for San Marzanos is that they must come from a limited number of fields in one agricultural region of southwestern Italy, the Agro Sarnese-Noceino. The same variety of tomato can be grown elsewhere, but it won't be an official San Marzano.
Those standards don't apply in the United States, meaning sellers can use the widely recognized name on tomatoes that wouldn't pass muster in their homeland.
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleges that while Cento processes the tomatoes it sells as San Marzanos from the Agro Sarnese-Noceino, many of them are actually grown outside that zone. A complaint filed in the suit claims a tool on Cento's website that allows buyers to find the field where each can of tomatoes was grown shows that some of the tomatoes were grown elsewhere in Italy's Campania region.
It also states that while Cento's distinctive yellow cans boast "certified" in bold letters, they do not bear the marking of an Italian consortium that confers the San Marzano title.
A similar lawsuit over San Marzanos was filed against Cento in federal court in New York earlier this year. That case has not yet been resolved.
A spokesman for Cento said the consortium mentioned in the California suit is not the only entity that certifies San Marzanos, and that its tomatoes are certified by a third party.
"At Cento, we take pride in the truthfulness and accuracy of our product labels," the company said in a statement. "Cento exceeds industry standards in production and has always operated with the highest integrity. Any suggestion to the contrary is absolutely false."

Piden “luz verde” para licencias de conducir a indocumentados en Nueva York

Texto completo: Crece la presión para que la legislatura de Nueva York avance el programa que entregaría licencias de conducción a indocumentados en todo el estado.
Una coalición de inmigrantes y activistas se manifestó este martes en Albany, sede del Gobierno del estado de Nueva York, para pedir que se apruebe este vital proyecto de ley.
La propuesta de ley, presentada por el asambleísta Marcos Crespo y el senador Luis Sepúlveda, está a la espera de recibir el respaldo de las dos cámaras legislativas, cuya sesión finaliza a mediados de junio, lo que preocupa a los inmigrantes que dependen de un coche para trabajar o desplazarse.
“Las licencias de conducir son necesarias para familias como la mía. En Long Island y a través del estado hay áreas donde conducir se convierte en la única opción porque no podemos confiar en el sistema público de transporte para ir al trabajo o llevar a nuestros niños a sus citas médicas”, aseguró Silvia García, residente de Long Island y miembro de la organización proinmigrante Se Hace Camino Nueva York.
“Los inmigrantes de Nueva York han esperado por mucho tiempo, necesitamos que la legislatura del estado tome acción ahora”, afirmó García en un comunicado de la “Coalición Luz Verde” que convocó la protesta de hoy.
Doce estados, Puerto Rico y el distrito de Columbia ya han otorgado licencias de conducir a indocumentados.
Para el asambleísta Crespo, el tiempo para restaurar el privilegio de conducir a los residentes que no son ciudadanos “es ahora”, dijo Crespo en referencia a que los indocumentados podían conducir en este estado.
Pero, en el 2002, un año después de los atentados terroristas del 11S, el gobernador George Pataki impuso el requisito de presentar el documento del seguro social para sacar o mantener la licencia de conducir, lo que llevó a que miles perdieran el permiso.
“Esta legislación hará las carreteras más seguras para todos los neoyorquinos. Además aumentará significativamente los ingresos para nuestro estado y reducirá el coste del seguro (de los coches) para todos los conductores” , afirmó.
Aunque resta poco tiempo para que concluya la sesión legislativa, antes de que comience el periodo de vacaciones, aún no hay fecha para votar el proyecto ni el gobernador Andrew Cuomo ha pedido a los legisladores que lo incluyan en la agenda.
Por su parte, el senador Sepúlveda aseguró que el proyecto de ley es “sin lugar a dudas una de las cosas correctas que hay que hacer para Nueva York, con carreteras más seguras, comunidades más fuertes y más unidas y un auge económico”.
Destacó que los inmigrantes indocumentados aportan más de mil millones de dólares al año a la economía del estado y que de aprobarse el proyecto, esa cantidad aumentará con la creación de más empleos, mejores salarios y millones de dólares en ingresos locales y estatales.
En un editorial el pasado abril, el periódico New York Times apoyó la legislación y destacó que se calcula que en Nueva York viven 750,000 indocumentados, lo que suponía más del 5 % de la fuerza trabajadora del estado en 201 6, de acuerdo con el Pew Research Center.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Ore. – In a one-sided series that could, and perhaps should, have been competitive but never quite got there, the most heartwarming plot line has been a story of family.
Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr describes the Currys as the "royal family of the NBA."
Over the course of the Warriors' three consecutive victories in the Western Conference finals, it has been hard to argue with that sentiment.
There's Dell Curry, a 16-year league veteran, watching over his sons, All-NBA sharp-shooter Steph and Portland Trail Blazers guard Seth, as they do battle. There's Sonya Curry, whose excited reactions when one of her boys produces a highlight-reel moment is just one of the ways she generates positive focus.
The league and its fans have enjoyed this story, and the brothers have backed up the narrative.
Even if the conference finals end in a sweep -- with the Warriors hungrily hunting a Game 4 win and the glut of rest that comes with it -- on Monday at the Moda Center, we will remember this sibling meeting for quite some time.
Game 2 was the highlight and decisive point of the series. It was Seth's best outing of the postseason, as he picked his brother's pocket for four steals, was a defensive pest and nailed clutch fourth-quarter shots, before Golden State's late-game poise clinched the win.
That performance has done a lot for the younger Curry and his growing reputation, that much is commonly accepted. But how much impact has this matchup had on Steph?
It was just two weeks ago that the Warriors' star had a question mark over him. He was struggling in the Western Conference semifinal series against the Houston Rockets, affected perhaps by a middle finger injury but also painfully low on confidence. Now, he is back to being one of the most dominant players in the NBA and a true star of this postseason. Kevin Durant's injury allowing Curry more freedom is given most of the credit, but has the sibling battle broken him out of his mini-slump, too?
"It feels good," Steph Curry said, when asked what it is like to be out there alongside Seth. "This was like the coolest experience I think I've ever had playing against him."
'An incredible story'
There is a spring back in Steph's step and a smile on his face once more.
There is little time for worry and hesitancy when his younger brother is around, because, hey, brotherly things can happen. Like when Seth tried to get in his head at the free throw line as Steph lined up a pair of late attempts in Game 2.
"That's like 70 in a row," Seth said, trying to jinx him.
"About to be 72," came the response.
There have been amusing moments and quotables aplenty. Steph has admitted that there have been times when he has gone through the motions of contesting shots to "look good" but hasn't minded if Seth's attempts have gone in.
Up in the stands, Dell and Sonya have worn hybrid jerseys of the teams, facilitated by a friend of Sonya's with gifted needlework skills, while watching with their daughter, Sydel Curry-Lee.
"I thought of their parents at one point," Kerr admitted. "Can you imagine watching your two boys go head-to-head in a playoff game and both hitting huge shots? It must have been amazing for them. It is an incredible story."
Finally finding his place
Seth Curry's story has not been as seamless as that of his brother, already a three-time NBA champion.
Floating around the NBA and the G-League and never quite latching on through five seasons, he eventually got his contract with the Blazers and locked into the struggle for playing time. He has proved his worth now, with Blazers coach Terry Stotts emphasizing that he got heavy minutes here not because of sibling insight but because of his talent.
In fairness, though, on the court, Seth does know his brother better than anyone.
"I've seen every Warriors game and every Steph game for the past 10 years," Seth said. "I feel like I know some things he likes to do."
The situation has been a joyous one for the family but also laced with trickiness. No matter what happens, the Currys will be left with one son going to the NBA Finals and another whose season ends in disappointment.
"I normally don't get nervous at all," Dell told The New York Times. "Playing 16 years in the league I thought that all my nerves were gone. But this has changed that."
These are the seventh set of brothers to meet in an NBA playoff series.
"As a parent what more can you ask for?" Warriors enforcer Draymond Green said. "Sonya is amazing and I love her, but Dell -- as a father who has played in the NBA -- that is a completely different thing. I can only imagine what that feels like."
Green, with a comedic twist typical of him, then joked he didn't care about the storyline aspect of it and hoped that "Steph destroys Seth."
That hasn't happened, but the simple and inescapable truth of this series is that however much Portland's passionate fan base has wanted them to be competitive, the Blazers have not been able to sustain their occasional bursts of productivity.
As a result, barring an extraordinary turnaround, Seth will leave these playoffs with his honor firmly intact and having shown he belongs. Meanwhile, ominously, his brother has gotten his mojo back.
Perhaps the family tone running through these conference finals has helped Steph feel comfortable again and enabled him to get back to enjoying basketball. Past experience shows that when that happens watch out.

Transgender Honduran waits here for asylum

Texto completo: The men drove Rachell to a desolate lot by a sugar factory, beat her and yelled, "If you were more of a man this wouldn't be happening to you!"
Rachell lay in the dirt, bleeding and weak. Her abductors let her escape on her promise never to return. So she fled Honduras and began the long journey to the United States that eventually led her to a sponsor's home in the Twin Cities' northwest suburbs to wait for her asylum case to be heard.
Amid a record number of Central American asylum-seekers seeking refuge from gang violence, Rachell's case features a rarer claim of persecution: She was targeted by the gang MS-13 because she is a transgender woman. Central America, like much of the world, can be a dangerous place for the LGBT community, and Rachell and human rights activists say they face threats from gangs there who want to use them for drug-running and prostitution.
Some immigration advocates see hope for transgender defendants, noting they have strong cases even in a climate where asylum is rarely granted.
"These are not people who are leaving their country because they're just trying to have a better life -- they're leaving their country because they're going to get murdered and raped if they stay," said Allegra Love, attorney and executive director of the nonprofit Santa Fe Dreamers Project. "These are winning cases and these are women who absolutely fall squarely into the group that our refugee [laws] intend to protect."
The Trump administration has been cracking down on migrants arriving from Central America, arguing that people fleeing widespread conditions of violence and poverty do not meet the specific standards of persecution that must be proven to receive asylum. Trump officials say that Central Americans are exploiting the system to find jobs -- often being released with court dates far into the future -- but do not meet the definition of refugees.
"I understand [President Donald Trump] because he's trying to protect his country," Rachell, 24, said of the president's discouragement of new arrivals at the Mexican border. "But … I wish he could see the things that we're suffering in our countries and that we don't have laws to protect us."
Ira Mehlman said it's hard to comment on individual cases, but asylum and refugee laws say that someone must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution, not just that they live in a dangerous country.
"We need to be distinguishing between people who are being singled out versus people who just live in a generally dysfunctional society," said Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington, D.C.,-based organization that advocates for restricting immigration.
He added that the U.S. must put pressure on the governments of these countries to ensure that people are not being singled out for persecution.
Getting a sponsor
The Santa Fe Dreamers Project helped connect Rachell with a sponsoring family in Minnesota as part of a strategy of getting transgender women released from detention and relocated in areas that are transgender-friendly and where immigration judges have higher approval rates of asylum claims.
In the immigration court in Bloomington, two of the three judges each approved roughly 26% and 30% of asylum cases in recent years, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University-based organization that tracks federal data.
Rachell recounted her story to the Star Tribune on the condition that she be referred to only by her first name, out of safety concerns for her and her family back in Central America. The Star Tribune also reviewed some of her immigration documents, including a transcript of a March interview with U.S. immigration authorities, to establish that she had "credible fear" of returning to Honduras.
Rachell said she grew up in a poor family in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, where her hard-drinking father beat her with electrical cords, used homophobic slurs when he saw her playing with dolls and said he wanted to make her a man. The family kicked her out of the house when she was 12. Rachell said she ate in churches and begged for money in the streets.
By the time she was 18, she found a job at a factory making shirts alongside many other gay and transgender workers. She said members of the MS-13 gang would approach her on her way home, teenagers packing 9-millimeter handguns and AK-47 assault rifles, taunting her to work for them.
Rachell told immigration authorities that the gang would kill her if she did not join. Eventually, they went to her family's home and shot two of her brothers, texting Rachell pictures of their bodies dead on the ground. She kept the photos, which she showed to the Star Tribune.
Then, she said, police -- guided by a gang member on a mobile phone -- kidnapped her. They beat her and took a photo of her appearing to be dead, presumably for evidence, and left her there. Rachell recounted walking several kilometers in the dark, her body aching, pushing through the November chill to find help. A sister sent her money to go to the United States, where she stayed at several detention centers.
She learned from an immigration official about Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico, which has space designated for transgender women, arranged to be transferred there and stayed for two months.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement told the New York Times it was holding 72 migrants who identify as transgender as of last June 30.
Love, of the Santa Fe Dreamers Project, said that without the pod for transgender inmates at Cibola, "women would be forced to choose between being very, very vulnerable to sexual assault and sexual violence in an all-male population, [but] when they say 'I can't be in an all-male population' they're often put into solitary confinement."
At home in Minnesota
Jamie Nabozny had been looking into how to sponsor asylum-seekers when he learned that transgender women faced a particular need. With help from the Santa Fe Dreamers Project, he began talking to Rachell by phone while she was in Cibola.
She came to live with his family in April, taking up residence in Nabozny's seven-bedroom house that he shares with his partner, mother, stepfather and four children ages 10 to 15. They've had to communicate using Google Translate on their phones. Piece by piece, he has come to understand her struggles for acceptance back home.
"I went through some pretty horrific things at the hands of people who were homophobic and didn't like me because I was gay," said Nabozny, who came out in the 1980s. "But I always went home to a family who loved and supported me, and if I didn't have that I can't imagine I would have survived."
Rachell, for her part, was surprised that the government here had allowed a gay couple to adopt children; she began to imagine what it would be like to have a family of her own one day. She feels accepted in the United States -- here they no longer stare at her and don't seem to discriminate.
Rachell acknowledged that winning asylum would be difficult, but "if they send me back, at least I can feel at one point in my life I was able to live the life I want."

Texto completo: Billionaire's grant will wipe out Morehouse class's student debt
ATLANTA - A billionaire technology investor and philanthropist says he will provide grants to wipe out the student debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse College - an estimated $40 million.
Robert F. Smith, this year's commencement speaker, made the announcement Sunday morning while addressing nearly 400 graduating seniors of the all-male historically black college in Atlanta. Smith is the Founder and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that invests in software, data, and technology-driven companies.
"On behalf of the eight generations of my family that have been in this country, we're gonna put a little fuel in your bus," Smith told the graduates. "This is my class, 2019. And my family is making a grant to eliminate their student loans."
The announcement elicited stunned looks from faculty and students alike, before the graduates broke into the biggest cheers of the morning. Morehouse said it is the single largest gift to the college.
Smith, who received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony, had already announced a $1.5 million gift to the school.
The pledge to eliminate student debt for the class of 2019 is estimated to be $40 million.
In the weeks before graduating from Morehouse on Sunday, 22-year-old finance major Aaron Mitchom drew up a spreadsheet to calculate how long it would take him to pay back his $200,000 in student loans - 25 years at half his monthly salary, per his calculations.
In an instant, that number vanished. Mitchom, sitting in the crowd, wept.

Report: Trump, Kushner bank transactions raised red flag
NEW YORK - Multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner aroused the suspicion of anti-money laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank in 2016 and 2017, according to The New York Times.
The specialists recommended the matter be referred to a unit of the Treasury Department that polices financial crimes, but bank executives rejected their advice, the newspaper reported on Sunday.
As a result, the "suspicious activity reports" about the transactions were never filed with the government, the New York Times reported.
The report didn't give specifics about the nature of the transactions but said some of them involved money being transferred back and forth with foreign entities or individuals.

Report: Navy submariners kept list rating female crew, sex acts
Sailors aboard a U.S. Navy submarine circulated sexually explicit lists that ranked female crew members, an investigation found. The lists, first reported Friday by Military.com, were uncovered through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The 74-page investigative report reveals two lists - one with Yelp-like star ratings on the women and another containing "lewd and sexist comments" beside each woman's name, according to Military.com.
In February 2018, the USS Florida became the second to integrate female members. The misconduct came to light four months later, when two sailors aboard the Florida brought the lists to a superior officer, reporting that they were stored on an internal computer network and updated regularly, Military.com reported.

In oil-rich Venezuela, mile-long lines to buy gas in major city
MARACAIBO, Venezuela - U.S. sanctions on oil-rich Venezuela appear to be taking hold, resulting in mile-long lines for fuel in the South American nation's second-largest city, Maracaibo.
Some drivers said they'd had to wait almost 24 hours to fuel up, and people have been grabbing catnaps on the hoods of cars or in truck beds.
Nearing empty and stuck in line, infectious diseases doctor Yoli Urdaneta said she couldn't make her shift to treat patients.
"I've spent four days trying to get gasoline," Urdaneta said. "But I couldn't."
Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets, said Sunday that stiff U.S. sanctions on top of Venezuela's decaying refineries has begun to hit home.

Man charged in abduction of girl, 8, from street
FORT WORTH, Texas - A man has been charged in the abduction of an 8-year-old girl who was snatched from a street in Fort Worth, Texas, as she walked with her mother.
Fort Worth police say the girl was found safe Sunday, about eight hours later, at a hotel in nearby Forest Hill.
Police say 51-year-old Michael Webb was arrested on an aggravated kidnapping charge. He is being held without bond.
Officer Buddy Calzada says a man grabbed the girl Saturday evening, and sped away with her in a car. Police released surveillance video of the car. Police found Webb and the girl at the hotel after witnesses reported seeing the car there.
She was taken to a hospital.
Online records don't show an attorney representing Webb who can speak on his behalf.

Plane crash in Honduras kills 4 Americans, 1 Canadian
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras - Four Americans and a Canadian pilot were killed when a small plane went down off the coast of Roatan island in Honduras, officials said Sunday.
Armed Forces spokesman Jose Domingo Meza confirmed the nationalities of those who died in Saturday's crash.
The Piper Cherokee Six plummeted into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from the popular tourist destination of Roatan en route to the port of Trujillo. The military said in a statement that rescue boats with police divers and firefighters recovered four bodies within minutes of the crash, and transported another to a hospital, where he later died.
The U.S. State Department also confirmed the deaths of four U.S. citizens. They did not release names.

In Indiana: An explosion leveled a home in southern Indiana early Sunday, killing one person, injuring two others and leaving several nearby homes uninhabitable, authorities said.
Hours after the explosion shattered windows across a Jeffersonville neighborhood and sent debris flying onto roofs, lawns and cars, officials had not said what they believe caused the explosion.
Indiana State Police, Jeffersonville police and firefighters were at the scene, along with crews from Vectren, a natural gas provider.
Jeffersonville police Lt. Isaac Parker told The Courier-Journal that the house exploded just before 5 a.m. Sunday in the Ohio River city.

Texto completo: About a decade ago, Gaia Repossi, the creative director of her family's namesake fine jewelry label, purchased a Robert Mapplethorpe photograph of a palm tree swaying
in the wind, its sharp black fronds caught against a blank sky. She felt the cool, elegant image shared the same aesthetic with her own minimalist-leaning work, and found herself turning to Mapplethorpe's pictures -- particularly to his self-portraits and his architectural still lifes of flora -- more and more. "It's not cute. It's very sharp, very serious," the designer, 33, says of the artist's body of work. Then, in 2016, came the opportunity to collaborate with his estate. The result -- a 24-piece tribute collection comprising necklaces, pendants, bracelets and rings -- will launch later this year, three decades after the photographer's death in 1989.
The design process began when the Paris-based Repossi delved into Mapplethorpe's archives at both the Getty in Los Angeles and the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation in New York and uncovered a side of the artist she hadn't previously known. In his early 20s, while living in the Chelsea Hotel, Mapplethorpe supported himself by selling talismanic jewelry he made from scavenged ephemera -- dice, nails, feathers, coins, empty crab claws swiped from restaurants. Enchanted, Repossi, who holds a master's degree in archaeology, sifted through the copious remnants of his jewelry (around 25 pieces, along with hundreds of additional fragments, remain), as well as Polaroids of a young Mapplethorpe and his friends modeling his wares, making sketches as she went.
Some of Mapplethorpe's creations, like a chain made from horseshoe nails, aligned with Repossi's penchant for abstract, recurring shapes. To recreate it, she cast nails in white and dark gray gold, looping them into stacked, graceful rings, some with pavé diamonds. A chain-link and cord necklace threaded with red and black ribbon, meanwhile, was rendered as a multilayered choker featuring dark red gold as well as steel, a new material for the brand. Other finds -- namely necklaces strung with crab claws, shells, animal figurines and skulls -- were a welcome challenge. Repossi ended up commissioning a maître d'art to carve molds of some of these figurative elements in wax, which were then cast into steel pendants and, in some cases, coated in bright colors like magenta and bottle green.
Like Mapplethorpe, Repossi is eager to upend convention -- for one piece, she raided the jewelry house's collection of vintage pearls, purchased in previous decades by her father, and paired them with beads of black gold, quartz and steel -- and she isn't shy about enlisting friends. To shoot the digital and social media campaign for the collection, she hired Juergen Teller to take 1970s-style Polaroids of Mapplethorpe's circle (Cindy Sherman, the model and artist David Croland) and fans (Virgil Abloh, the curator Flavin Judd) wearing pieces from the collection, which, in addition to an ongoing exhibition at the Guggenheim in New York and a recent biopic by Ondi Timoner, is the latest evidence of a Mapplethorpe renaissance.
On the other hand, "Mapplethorpe mania," as the New York Times critic Andy Grundberg put it in 1988, has never quite waned. "He's an artist that spans centuries," says Michael Ward Stout, the president of the Mapplethorpe Foundation and the artist's lawyer during his lifetime, citing recent exhibitions that placed Mapplethorpe alongside Michelangelo and Caravaggio. Early in Timoner's film, Patti Smith, played by Marianne Rendón, asks the photographer, "What will become of the world when no trace of you remains?" "I think there'll be some traces," he replies. For Repossi, helping to uphold Mapplethorpe's legacy gives her work a deeper meaning. "Then the design has its own narrative," she says. "It becomes more than just a simple object." -- Meara Sharma

Texto completo: We tend to recall the past not on its own merits but in terms of what it lacked in retrospect. Virtually the entire period of planetary existence is lumped into the condescending unit "before Christ." Our hominid ancestors are described not as astonishing animals that harnessed the destructive force of fire, but "prehistoric" -- people who didn't know how to write.
In 2019, we remember 1994 as a time not with answering machines, a digital Encyclopaedia Britannica and the IBM Simon, but before Google, before texting and before iPhones.
Why are we remembering 1994? Good question. It's one I asked and was asked many times over the course of my experimental week attempting to live in 2019 like it was 1994. The best answer I got from my boss -- that 1994 was 25 years ago -- is, generally, not a sound enough reason to begin operating outside the norms of contemporary society at great personal inconvenience, but then again, few workplaces are as accommodating to caprice as The New York Times Styles section, in any year. Creative forces beyond my control had designated spring 2019 as the time to revisit Generation X. How are they doing? What are they doing? What do they remember? And what do they love?
The answer is: 1994.
Why? Because it was 25 years ago.
I was four years old when the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect, an iconic 25 years ago. I consider myself an average American, which is how I know the average American spent 1994 eating Dunkaroos in the back seat. Yet some Americans were not in the back seat: They were in the office. They were in brand-new restaurants that opened in 1994. They were in phone booths, not necessarily to urinate. They were smoking cigarettes -- not on domestic flights under six hours, thanks to a then-recently-passed draconian law prohibiting this, but just about everywhere else. When they gazed at their hands, they saw not a bewitching black glass rectangle that would show them anything from anywhere in the world, but appendages resembling twin opaque flattened jellyfish with stick-like tentacles -- i.e., hands.
My assignment was to attempt, for one week, to live, 24/7, as if it were 1994. Or, rather, to pretend to inhabit a version of 2019 in which the evolution of technology and culture had ceased 25 years prior -- an idea that melded the elegance of Einstein's notions about time's illusory nature with the perplexing militance of a living history flash mob of one.
How to Plan a Time Travel
Under the terms of the exercise, I would 1994-ify everything within my purview. For instance, while I would not be required to pantomime working at a phantom New York Times office inside the dual-level bowling alley and entertainment complex that now occupies the site of the newspaper's 1994 operations, I would avoid catching B trains to work since they did not stop at my neighborhood subway station in 1994. To the extent possible, I would use only products invented in or before 1994. I would dine exclusively at restaurants that opened that year or earlier. My irrational need to receive constant updates on all current events and internet gossip (normally fulfilled by compulsively checking my Twitter feed and remaining in round-the-clock text message communication with friends checking their own slightly different Twitter feeds) would have to be satisfied by the newspaper, the radio and network news.
Read more about the tech, music, style, books, rules, films and pills that scream Gen X.
Aside from figuring out how to get from anywhere to anywhere (which, I eventually discovered, was sadly nearly impossible in 1994), the most taxing element was preparation. At work, my primary tools would be paper -- a kind of very, very thin, stiff, dry, fragile fabric for writing on -- pens, and my landline desk phone. As a Styles section reporter working in 1994, I almost certainly would not have had personal internet access at work, so I would reduce my 2019 computer to word processor functionality -- no email. I would also relinquish access to my workplace's warren of internal online chat rooms, 29 of which I am currently a member -- three of which might be described as having at least some relation to my actual job and two of which are dedicated to revealing locations of free food and leftovers inside the Times building.
1994 would extend to my personal life too. The day before my new year began, I made a list of those acquaintances with whom I had interacted at least twice over the past three weeks -- about thirty in all -- and emailed them a note explaining that, while I would be unreachable for the next week by email, text message, instant message, Instagram direct message, Twitter direct message, tagged tweet or tagged Instagram comment, I was not in danger, in rehab, or even out of town, and I would love to hear from them by phone (including at my work extension) if they were inclined to talk or make plans. (Few were.) I transformed my iPhone into a landline by disabling notifications for every application except calls, and leaving it plugged into a wall outlet in my kitchen. I printed out seven pages of phone contacts because I did not know any of my friends' phone numbers, nor indeed the phone number of the man I have been dating for four years and am engaged to marry.
I bought a genuine 1994 Radio Shack television set with a built in VCR on eBay. It arrived broken. A Radio Shack cassette tape recorder also purchased on eBay also arrived broken. 1994 was not that long ago, but everything from 1994 was broken, or seemed so. I fretted that the 1994 Sony Walkman I received was also broken because no music emanated from it when I turned it on, but then I discovered that the Walkman merely demanded headphones before it would play (static-clogged radio stations or a tape of loon calls I bought at a thrift store for a quarter). I worried that the alarm clock I bought as a stand-in for my phone alarm -- a rotund plastic polar bear sunbathing in a lounge chair at what nearby signage indicates is the North Pole, holding a bottle of Coca-Cola in each hand, set atop a circular red digital clock base printed with the Coca-Cola Company logo -- was broken, because I couldn't get it to sound. The problem turned out to be a missing battery; it had been so long since I'd used an electronic with a battery cartridge I was intended to be able to open (or locate) that I'd almost forgotten to check. (I do suspect the artifact may still have been broken, because, although I eventually got it to sing "Coca-Cola's always the one! Whenever there is fun there's always Coca-Cola! Yeah!" on repeat, the bear never rotated slowly, the way it allegedly did on all the other 1994 suntanning-bear-enjoying-two-bottles-of-Coca-Cola alarm clocks for sale on eBay.)
Because I couldn't bear the idea of giving up even a single week of planning my wedding, I bought the 1994 Special Celebrity Wedding Issue of People magazine (which featured Marla Maples -- married late December 1993 to the "tycoon" Donald Trump -- on the cover) as well as the 308-page 1994 "Bride's All New Book of Etiquette." (Page 213: "'Don't DJ's show up at parties in jeans, wearing gold chains?' Simply specify that you would like the DJ to wear formal attire.") I ordered the cheapest cookbook from 1994 I could find, which was titled "Cooking Light Cookbook 1994." I borrowed a 1994 Zagat from a co-worker.
To help me identify buildings it was safely 1994 to go into, I acquired "New York, a Guide to the Metropolis" a walking tour book published in 1994 that is still recommended reading (by the government of New York City) for individuals hoping to obtain an official sightseeing guide license. For entertainment, I bought the books "The Celestine Prophecy" and "Prozac Nation." And for exercise, I purchased guided aerobic VHS tapes on eBay.
Because of a 1994 Times trend story about humans using horsehair products, I purchased Mane & Tail shampoo and conditioner (which seem to be sold only in humongous horse sizes) at my local drugstore, as well as L'Oreal Paris True Match Foundation (debuted 1994), Maybelline Great Lash mascara (1971) and Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream (1914). I bought a 1,188 page 1994 manual with the deceptively simple name "Using the Internet," which featured chapters like "BBS, UUCP, and Other Polled Services" that were incomprehensible to me, a person who exists more on the internet than in real life.
The toughest thing about going to 1994 would be leaving behind my fiancé, Taylor, particularly as I would still be living in our shared apartment. Taylor was proud of my journalistic ambition -- "This can't affect my life. This cannot affect me. I'm not getting paid," he said when I revealed the assignment -- and he would, in many ways, bear the brunt of it. For a week, he and I would be unable to enjoy one another's company while watching streaming and OnDemand TV programming in stunning 4K resolution, which made me realize the majority of our free time is spent enjoying one another's company while watching streaming and OnDemand TV programming in stunning 4K resolution, the picture quality of which is sometimes so crisply detailed it borders on hallucinatory. All of our social plans would have to be decided in advance, since he would be unable to reach me unless I happened to be near the kitchen, at my desk at work or already with him. Most annoyingly for both of us, Taylor (along with everyone I encountered) would be banned from using his smartphone to inform me of the time, the forecast, directions, invitations, addresses, phone numbers, recipes, news he had learned from digital sources and the easily researched answers to any of my spontaneous questions.
But back to the whole reason I agreed to the 1994 endeavor: cognitive dissonance that leaves me unable to calibrate effort and reward. In this instance, it manifested as a willingness to give up most of the things I enjoy about my life in order to buy Dunkaroos with company money.
A Day in the Life of 1994
I had long since stopped seeing Dunkaroos (with that distinctive kangaroo mascot whose job or obsession it is to dunk small tasteless cookies into inch-deep depressions of chocolate icing) in grocery stores, but it was on Amazon I confirmed that the fertile green Earth I inhabited as a child is now a post-Dunkaroo apocalyptic wasteland. Currently, there is one product labeled "Dunkaroos" -- in a highly unfamiliar and suspect Dunkaroo font -- available on Amazon for the heart-attack-inducing price of $ 19.98. This appears to be an imported Australian variety of the snack distributed by a different company. (General Mills discontinued the original product years ago.) I investigated the possibility of purchasing Dunkaroos on the Dark Web, and discovered to my horror that three people in Australia had recently been charged with running a syndicate that moved roughly $ 12 million worth of drugs "disguised as candy" across the country. I envisioned myself ripping the foil from a pack of hard-won Dunkaroos and finding only LSD tabs inside. I couldn't handle that kind of letdown. I resigned myself to purchasing only regulation 1994 Gushers and Fruit Roll-Ups. And then also the fake Dunkaroos, which were terrible.
The first thing I noticed at midnight when the clock struck 1994 was the sudden silence in the room. The second thing was the deafening volume of my inner monologue. I was getting ready for bed, performing the half-dozen mostly mindless tasks that, because they occupy my hands, normally provide a treasured window for listening to an audiobook or podcast. As I smeared surprisingly solid and burning Noxzema cream across my cheeks, however, all I could hear were my own thoughts. Tedious thoughts. Thoughts about what I was doing at that very moment, what I would do in the seconds that followed and how loud my inner monologue was. I can't live with this woman for a week, I thought, and it reverberated through my head like a shout.
A couple days into the experiment, I would realize something even stranger: I no longer had any inner monologue at all.
Every day in 1994, I woke up -- "Coca-Cola's always the one!" -- and listened to the local jazz radio station while getting dressed in one of the 1994 period ensembles generously lent to me by a co-worker (a beige power suit with prominent shoulder pads one day; a silver vinyl miniskirt the next). About 20 minutes into my first morning, I learned from NPR that Julian Assange had been arrested in London, which is normally the kind of information I'd receive seconds after opening my eyes, while scrolling through my phone in bed half-asleep. In addition to providing brief news summaries, the radio was my primary source of weather forecast information. It was incorrect every single day, but never more so than the morning I embarked on a 35-block pilgrimage to visit Manhattan's four remaining pay phones (all on the Upper West Side) and was forced to spend 20 minutes standing under scaffolding, filthy city rainwater soaking the pages of my handwritten observations. ("Pigeon in second booth.")
There were challenges indoors as well. At work, I discovered I had no way to access my voice mail because I had never set it up. (Since I never give out that phone number -- since I did not even know that phone number -- I had always figured I would not receive important calls on it.) I dialed the office helpline to ask for assistance resetting my PIN, and received the good news that a temporary password link had been sent to my email address.
"I can't access my email right now," I said.
"You're locked out of that too?" the gentleman helping me asked.
"No," I said. "It's on purpose."
Because I had presented him with a unique problem -- not a person who was unable to access the link, but a person who refused to -- we remained at an impasse for several minutes.
Reality Bites
People accepted "I am in 1994" as an excuse to varying degrees. The most common response was a burst of disbelieving laughter, followed by a declaration that that person was "actually kind of jealous" of my technology fast. A few people ignored the construct, continuing, I discovered later, to send me important, time-sensitive information in formats I was temporarily unable to receive (in effect creating their own false version of 2019 in which I was not inhabiting a false version of 1994). One person seemed to think I was lying to get out of looking at a dog's Instagram account.
The most time-consuming task of my week was identifying places to go, and figuring out how to go to them with paper maps. I spent hours methodically calling restaurants listed in the Zagat (under "Fireplaces," for instance) to see if they still existed. They don't. Or, anyway, most of them don't. The majority of numbers just rang forever, although one call was answered with the confusing but chipper greeting "Hello, 'Live'!" I had dialed a Chilean restaurant from 1994, and had reached an employee of "Live with Kelly and Ryan" at her desk.
In the weekly allotment of time I normally spend half-browsing the internet while half-watching TV, I read three books. ("The Celestine Prophecy": Didn't expect it to be a guide to turning myself invisible. "Prozac Nation": Exhausting. "The Bean Trees": Introduced me to Coca-Cola cake.) I reorganized my dresser and my closet. Taylor and I went for walks. One evening, I even cracked open "Cooking Light" and prepared my sweetheart a complete meal called "Dinner for Your Sweetheart," which was disgusting.
I should have known it would be, because while light cooking is not a radical concept, many of the dishes depicted in this book were unrecognizable to me, a townsperson from the future.
What is neon green and white and perfect for "Lunch After the Workout"? I still couldn't tell you, despite scrutinizing the recipe. (Vichyssoise?) What is my "favorite ice milk"? What is "ice milk"?
As I set to work preparing the bruschetta and "vegetable-cheese" linguine the recipe described as "an elegant yet easy meal that's simple enough to make after a day at work" (when "it's just you and your beloved"), I learned that nutritious cooking in 2019 is a distant cousin of the 1994 version. Vegetables were sautéed in cooking spray. I was prohibited from adding salt to the pasta water, yet instructed to spread a thick mixture of goat cheese, Parmesan and "nonfat cream cheese product" over each slice of bruschetta. Because the linguine ingredients did not include salt, butter, olive oil or even garlic, it wasn't clear to me what was supposed to add flavor to the pasta; the final answer appeared to be nothing.
(Also, despite appearing in the "Quick & Easy" chapter, the recipe included a chocolate meringue dessert -- topped with chocolate frozen yogurt and chocolate syrup -- that, per the instructions, required over three hours to execute.)
I dressed the noodles. I arranged strips of wet peppers into heart shapes on the pieces of bruschetta, as directed. I summoned my sweetheart.
"What do you think?" I asked as we ate the warm-paper-flavored meal.
"It's not bad," said Taylor. "It's like they made something inherently kind of unhealthy, flavorless." He advised me to add some of the leftover goat cheese to my linguine.
"Is it good?" I asked, watching him do it.
"Not really," he said with a shrug, "but it gives it a taste."
I told him dessert would be ready shortly after 11 p.m.
Back to the Future
While I will stop at nothing to avoid making or receiving a phone call in 2019, phone conversations in my private 1994 provided valuable lifelines to the loved ones and entertainment news from which I had been cruelly severed. I felt adored when Taylor called me one morning at work to ask if I'd "heard the big news." ("No!" I exclaimed. "I bet you didn't!" he said, and hung up.) I teared up with gratitude when I arrived home to a friend's detailed voice mail explaining that the television host Wendy Williams was filing for divorce, and how it was going. Contributing to my isolation was the fact that calls made from inside The New York Times office appear to originate from a spam number ending in "1234" -- a detail I'd forgotten to warn people about beforehand, which resulted in most of my outgoing calls being ignored. The only person I ever managed to reach on the first try was my cousin, because she assumed I was a telemarketer and was going to let her baby daughter field the call since she enjoys babbling at the phone.
By the fourth or fifth day of 1994, I'd stopped impulsively grabbing at empty spaces on my desk for my cellphone, but my reflex to quickly Google things never deteriorated. I began compiling my questions -- a list of itches to be scratched at a later time -- and spent the final day of my week at the Brooklyn Public Library, to see what percentage of answers I could find in books. About 17 percent, it turned out. While I was not able to learn the location of the nearest FedEx, the best-selling compact mirror of all time or the name of a green Chanel nail polish I had recently seen in a discount store, I did learn the ingredients in Coca-Cola cake, where Josephine Baker was born (St. Louis), and what happened to Joan Lunden after 1994.
I had been introduced to the concept of Joan Lunden only a few days prior, via her 1994 workout tape "Workout America." It opens with a clip montage of Ms. Lunden horseback riding, bungee jumping, ice climbing, fly fishing, ice skating, playing baseball, and, again, horseback riding, before cutting to her on set in a TV studio where she observes, "Boy, is life fun these days!" Then: "Hi, I'm Joan Lunden. You probably know me best as the co-host of 'Good Morning America."'
I had not known Ms. Lunden was ever a co-host of "Good Morning America." I had simply purchased her tape online because it was released in the correct year for my irreverent assignment. But, marching in time with Joan and her friends, alone in my living room, I discovered the only thing about 1994 I truly enjoyed: workout videos. I loved the inane prerecorded affirmations. I loved learning individual dance routine components and putting them all together at full speed. I loved the way Joan said, "and my personal favorite, papaya" when describing her refrigerator "filled with melons, and berries, and my personal favorite, papaya."
I copied down the Dewey Decimal number for her 2015 book "Had I Known," and located it on a shelf. The subtitle took the wind out of my sails -- "A memoir of survival." In the first pages, I learned that Joan had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014. The news made my silly assignment feel stupid. Impudent, even. Joan had seemed to delight in her health on the tape in 1994. Twenty-five years later, it was a success to be surviving.
I left the library to head to dinner with someone I had never met at a place I had never been. On the subway, I realized I had forgotten to bring the notebook where, earlier in the week, I had written the restaurant's address. I'm used to jotting everything down (typing it in the Notes app on my phone) because I have a terrible memory. I sat up in my seat and considered the situation.
Apart from my initially cacophonous inner monologue, plus an hourslong stretch while looking for the phone booths when I could not stop thinking about the 1950 Lionel Hampton rendition of "Boogie Woogie Santa Claus," my mind was dead quiet for the majority of 1994. I wasn't bored. I was just thinking in a very straightforward way about whatever I happened to be doing at that moment.
Out of this silence, out of some long-since-condemned corner of my hippocampus, the address surfaced. I was startled. I'd assumed my memory was an oubliette. All this time it was actually a sunken living room with built-in custom storage?
I pictured my frantic brain. In 2019, it spent its days firing off repeated ALL CAPS bulletins of basic information into a nonstop podcast din. Could the mental screaming from day one have been the remnant of an adaptation -- a way to break through my usual torrent of technology-enabled stimuli? Maybe the quiet hadn't replaced my thoughts. Maybe my thoughts had just relaxed into their natural hushed state. 1994 was the time before the commotion. Or that seemed plausible, anyway. I couldn't look it up.

Nike to Change Pregnancy Policy in Athlete Contracts; Sneaker giant says it won't reduce pay during pregnancy after criticism from Olympian Alysia Montaño

Texto completo: Nike Inc. said it is adding language to new contracts for female athletes that will protect their pay during pregnancy, after coming under fire for cutting compensation for some athletes.
The sneaker giant said Friday it had adopted the policy last year but was now writing the terms into its future endorsement deals. Previously, the contracts gave Nike the right to reduce pay if runners failed to meet performance thresholds for any reason, including pregnancy or childbirth.
Although Nike isn't changing existing contracts, the company said current athletes would receive similar protections. "We will provide appropriate assurances for existing contracts to reinforce our policy," a Nike spokesman said Friday.
The move comes days after one of its former runners, Alysia Montaño, criticized Nike and its rivals for their policies around pregnancy.
In an op-ed published in the New York Times , Ms. Montaño said that when she told Nike several years ago that she wanted to have a baby during her career, the company told her it would pause her contract and stop paying her. She changed sponsors and signed with Asics.
"The sports industry allows for men to have a full career and when a woman decides to have a baby it pushes women out at their prime," she said in a video published on Mother's Day .
On Saturday, Ms. Montaño, an Olympian and U.S. national champion, said she was pleased that Nike was adding protections for pregnancy in new contracts but questioned what happens after pregnancy. She also said she was skeptical about the company's assurances for existing athletes. "If they get pregnant, are they just supposed to take Nike's word for it?" she said.
After switching sponsors, she famously competed in the 2014 U.S. championships when she was eight months pregnant. Following the birth of her daughter, she said that Asics also threatened to end her contract.
She had received assurances from Asics, she said, but those weren't enough. "Because it wasn't in my contract, they threatened to penalize me," she said in an interview Saturday. "I had to fight for my money."
Ms. Montaño said she is still waiting for Asics and other brands to provide more clarity on whether they are changing their contracts. "They are being let off the hook," she said.
Nike acknowledged it had reduced pay for a few female athletes, but said that last year it changed its policies so women would no longer be penalized financially for pregnancy. However, that change wasn't written into contracts.
"Moving forward, our contracts for female athletes will include written terms that reinforce our policy," the Nike spokesman said on Friday. "We recognize we can do more and that there is an important opportunity for the sports industry to evolve to support female athletes."
On Saturday, the Nike spokesman said the company's policy applies both during and after pregnancy.
A spokeswoman for Asics didn't address the question of whether the company is changing contracts to add protections for pregnancy. "We honor our contracts with athletes," she said. "And we continuously look for evolving the ways we support them."

Texto completo: As the Democratic Party in 2019 begins to wake up to the fact that its intellectual and activist vanguard is deeply at odds with both its voting base and the vast majority of its elected officials, the politics of Washington and the 2020 primary are shifting in unexpected ways. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="358">
In Congress, Nancy Pelosi survived a campaign in which more than three dozen Democratic candidates, nearly all running in conservative or moderate districts, refused to endorse her for House speaker. Ms. Pelosi, in turn, has embraced the large wing of newly elected centrists that gave her the majority. She has repeatedly dismissed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her peers as irrelevant.
"When we won this election, it wasn't in districts like mine or Alexandria's . those are districts that are solidly Democratic. This glass of water," she said at one event, hoisting a glass, "would win with a D next to its name in those districts."
In an interview, she repudiated socialism ("I do reject socialism as an economic system. If people have that view, that's their view. That is not the view of the Democratic Party"), and when asked about the faction associated with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, she replied, "That's like five people."
Ms. Pelosi keeps making this point so insistently and even rudely because, perhaps, the media have kept missing it. Only half of House Democrats support "Medicare for all," and slightly fewer representatives support the Green New Deal. (Ms. Pelosi's assessment of the latter - "It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive. The green dream, or whatever they call it" - summarized its very dim prospects.) Meanwhile, Ms. Pelosi has broken from the left on other high-profile controversies. She has refused to initiate impeachment hearings or hold a vote specifically condemning anti-Semitism following Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments accusing Israel supporters of foreign allegiance.
College-educated white Democratic voters have shown a growing concern about structural bias in American society: a transformation owed to social progressives, who tend to be the most skeptical about nominating a white man for president. To them, the struggle against racism and sexism correlates with a belief in increasing representation of women and people of color. Many Democratic voters, on the other hand, have arrived at the opposite conclusion. If racism and sexism are so endemic, they've decided, then beating Donald Trump requires nominating a white man. "You'll always hear, 'There's no way a woman can win this,' and they go back to Hillary," one voter told The New York Times. "Even among my female friends."

Most of the party's presidential candidates took the claims of the ascendant left at face value when they undertook their campaigns. Candidates like Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke and Elizabeth Warren designed their platforms as if they had to compete ideologically with Bernie Sanders. Several of them have already advocated Medicare for all or the Green New Deal, which could expose them to withering attacks from Mr. Trump if they win the nomination.
None of their left-leaning plans stands a chance to pass Congress under the next president, even in the best-case scenario. All of them poll badly. (Medicare for all sounds popular until you tell people it means eliminating private insurance, at which point it grows unpopular.) The candidates seem to have overestimated how much left-wing policy voters actually demand.
Democratic voters might be dissuaded from nominating their former vice president if they hear more about his long record or if he repeats the undisciplined campaigning that led to defeats in both of his previous presidential campaigns. But it is already clear enough that he is supplying something much closer to what the party's electorate wants than either the political media or the other candidates had assumed. A Democratic Party in which Joe Biden is running away with a nomination simply cannot be the one that most people thought existed. Some of Ms. Harris' advisers, the Times recently reported, are urging her to stop mollifying activists and embrace her prosecutorial past.
It might slowly be dawning on the left that its giddy predictions of ascendancy have not yet materialized. Corey Robin, a left-wing writer who has previously heralded the left's impending takeover of the Democratic Party, recently conceded he may have miscalculated. "We have nothing like the organizational infrastructure, the party organization, the intellectual and ideological coherence or political leadership we need," he wrote. "I don't see anything on the horizon like the cadre of ideologues and activists that made the New Deal or Reagan Revolution."
Jonathan Chait writes for New York magazine, from which this was excerpted.

Texto completo: LAS CRUCES – To ensure repairs have been successfully made to the pond at Young Park, 1905 Nevada Ave., crews with the City of Las Cruces Parks & Recreation Department will be dropping the pond's water level this weekend, beginning Saturday, May 18.
Dropping the water level will enable crews to check the pond's drain and to make sure a leak was completely fixed, when repairs to the Young Park pond were made earlier this year, according to a city news release. Also, when the water level is dropped, the pond's aerators will have to be turned off so the motors on that equipment don't burn out.
The park pond had been refilled after a restoration project in recent months.
If it has been determined all pond repairs are complete, refilling of the pond would begin Monday, May 20.
It is anticipated the Young Park pond could be restocked with fish by the end May.
Efforts to restock the pond with fish are being coordinated between the City and the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish.

Udall introduces horseracing legislation WASHINGTON – Ahead of Saturday's Preakness Stakes, U.S. Senators Tom Udall, D-N.M., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., introduced the Racehorse Doping Ban Act of 2019, which would establish consistent medication rules across the industry and strict doping penalties for horse races already governed by federal law.
"It is past time that Congress stop rewarding the horse racing industry for its inhumane doping violations with sweetheart gambling privileges and millions in casino slots subsidies," said Udall in a news release. "This weekend, fans will tune into the second leg of the Triple Crown. And behind the scenes, horses competing in the Preakness Stakes may be injected with pain medications before being loaded into the starting gate. With racehorse death rates higher than in any other country, the U.S. industry has completely failed to self-regulate its doping and corruption abuses. Legislation to ban doping in horseracing is the meaningful action we need to end the abuse of these iconic animals. Headlines around the country make it clear the future of this sport is in serious doubt, and this may be the last chance for meaningful reform—it's time for industry leaders to take the blinders off."
"It's clear industry leaders are more concerned with their profits than protecting these iconic creatures," Wyden said. "It's time for Congress to step in and end the cycle of abuse by banning the cruel practice of doping in horseracing once and for all."
While horse racing showcases the beauty of an iconic animal, chronic abuse of performance-enhancing drugs is commonplace and undermines the safety and viability of the sport, the news release states. Drugged up with painkillers and performance-enhancing substances, racehorses can be pushed beyond their limits, leading to break downs with potentially fatal consequences for horses and jockeys.
Congress considered banning drugs in horseracing in the 1980s but left that decision up to individual states. As a result, almost every horse is given race-day medication — banned in other countries — and no uniform medication rules or doping penalties exist across the states. A recent New York Times report stated that the U.S. has a racehorse fatality rate that is up to five times greater than in other countries with nearly 10 horses dying a week. The scale of the tragedy was made shockingly clear earlier this year when twenty-three racehorses died in a span of three months at the famous Santa Anita Track in California, prompting the owners to close the track temporarily and consider new reforms.
Under Udall and Wyden's legislation, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) —which is the official anti-doping body for US Olympic sport — would develop rules for permitted and prohibited substances and create anti-doping education, research, testing and adjudication programs for horse racing. The bill would also:
Put an end to race day medication;
Set a harmonized medication policy framework for all races with interstate "simulcast" wagering;
Require stiff penalties for cheating, including "one and done" and "three strikes, you're out" lifetime bans for the worst cases; and
Ensure racehorse drug administrations meet veterinary ethics.
Alternative legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives that would not specifically ban the most harmful doping practices but rather create an industry dominated panel to list approved racehorse drugs.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A major investigation into sexual abuse at Ohio State University found no hard evidence that coaches like Jim Jordan, now a prominent Republican in Congress, knew of a team doctor's rampant sexual misconduct. But the 182-page report released on Friday said dozens of other coaches acknowledged that rumors of the doctor's predatory behavior were rife.
Mr. Jordan, a former assistant wrestling coach who has denied knowing of the abuse or hearing any locker-room talk about it, claimed complete vindication on Friday. "It confirms everything I said," he told reporters on Capitol Hill. "If we'd have known about it, we'd have reported it. It confirms everything I've said before. I didn't know about anything. If I would've, I'd have done something."
[Read the Ohio State University investigation.]
The actual findings, however, were more ambiguous than that. The report said that the university physician, Richard H. Strauss, was "infatuated" with the wrestling team and timed his workouts so he could shower with the wrestlers.
Aside from one fencing coach, investigators wrote, "we did not identify any other contemporaneous documentary evidence indicating that members of the O.S.U. coaching staff, including head coaches or assistant coaches, received or were aware of the complaints regarding Strauss sexual misconduct."
"However," it continued, "the Investigation Team received allegations from numerous student-athletes indicating that they talked about Strauss's inappropriate genital exams and complained about Strauss's locker-room voyeurism directly to -- or in front of -- O.S.U. coaching staff."
Wrestlers who worked with Mr. Jordan in the late 1980s and early 1990s continue to say that he did know of Dr. Strauss's predatory behavior, and his claims of exoneration rankled some wrestlers.
"How can he be vindicated? What he's doing now is throwing salt in the wound," said Dunyasha Yetts, a wrestler at the university in 1992 and 1993, who was one of the first and most outspoken victims to come forward.
In a graphic and sprawling report, independent investigators hired by Ohio State University found that 177 students, all men, were victims of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Dr. Strauss, a team doctor and physician from the late 1970s to the 1990s who has since committed suicide.
The university began investigating after a former wrestler, Mike DiSabato, came forward and accused Dr. Strauss of abuse and named Mr. Jordan, who served as an assistant coach on the Ohio State wrestling team in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as a witness who turned a blind eye to the misconduct.
Those accusations ensnared Mr. Jordan, Republican of Ohio, last July. He mounted an aggressive defense, maintaining that not only was he unaware of the abuse, but also that his accusers were politically motivated. The conservative public relations firm Shirley & Banister Public Affairs circulated statements of support to reporters from wrestlers defending Mr. Jordan and claiming that the accusers were "seeing dollar signs."
But the report released on Friday, the culmination of a yearlong investigation in which more than 500 people were interviewed, found that 22 coaches confirmed they were "aware of rumors and/or complaints about Strauss." Mr. Jordan was interviewed by investigators in Ohio in July, a spokesman confirmed last summer.
"I thought that the lawyer who did that handled it the proper way, and we told him the same thing we've told everyone in a public way," Mr. Jordan said on "The Bob Frantz Authority" radio show.
But many of Dr. Strauss's victims painted a picture of abuse widely known and unaddressed.
"From my experience, it was so publicly acknowledged within that community that I felt like it was open, public, acceptable behavior," Mike Glane, who wrestled at the university from 1993 to 1998 and was interviewed by investigators, said Friday in an interview. "I didn't even think about reporting it."
Mr. Yetts said that Mr. Jordan not only knew of allegations of sexual misconduct when he was an assistant wrestling coach at the university, but he personally confronted the team doctor accused of sexually abusing athletes.
Mr. Yetts has spoken of episodes with Dr. Strauss before, including his charge that Mr. Jordan had confronted the doctor. But in an interview, the former wrestler went into far more detail on at least three specific events in which Mr. Jordan was told of the misconduct. The episodes, as described by Mr. Yetts, challenge both the narrative that Mr. Jordan turned a blind eye to abuse, and the congressman's own statements that he knew nothing about it.
Mr. Jordan did, in fact, try to deal with the doctor, according to Mr. Yetts, in November 1992, after he was first examined by Dr. Strauss after transferring from Purdue University. Mr. Yetts had received physicals from doctors at Purdue, so he said he was alarmed after Dr. Strauss groped and painstakingly examined his genitals.
Mr. Yetts said he angrily burst into the locker room and went directly to Mr. Jordan and the head coach, Russ Hellickson.
"I came out and was yelling at Jim and Russ, 'I don't know what you do at Ohio State, but if this is the way it's done, I'm transferring out,"' he said. "I said, 'This dude is two centimeters from my penis."'
After calming him down, the two coaches then accompanied him back into the doctor's office.
"They said: 'Doc, what just happened? This guy is complaining,"' Mr. Yetts said of his coaches. "He said, 'I'm just being thorough."'
When Mr. Yetts became upset and began yelling, he said, Mr. Hellickson asked him to step out. The head coach and Mr. Jordan stayed in the doctor's office, and when they emerged, Mr. Hellickson told Mr. Yetts that he had confronted the doctor and "told him he's making the guys uncomfortable." He said he had taken care of the situation, Mr. Yetts said.
But the next year, when Mr. Yetts saw Dr. Strauss after he sustained a thumb injury and the doctor tried to pull down his wrestling shorts, he concluded that nothing had changed.
"I came out screaming, saying, 'Why am I getting a physical for my thumb injury?"' Mr. Yetts said.
A number of wrestlers were standing in the locker room at the time, and Mr. Jordan was standing in the doorway, Mr. Yetts said.
"He just kind of blew it off, he was like, 'Are you serious?"' Mr. Yetts said. "He said, 'I would kill him if he tried to do that to me,' and walked away."
That episode was first corroborated to NBC News, then to The New York Times by Shawn Dailey, who wrestled on the team with Mr. Yetts. A third wrestler on the team who was in the locker room during the thumb episode confirmed that Mr. Jordan dismissed Mr. Yetts's comments.
Dr. Strauss was also known to linger in the showers, standing with his back to the wall so he could have a full view to ogle the athletes. Mr. Yetts said that Mr. Hellickson and Mr. Jordan would confront him from time to time in the showers as well.
"When Russ or Jordan said, 'Doc, get out of the showers,' it's the only time he'd actually get out," Mr. Yetts said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Natalie Kitroeff, a business reporter at The New York Times, guest-hosted two episodes of "The Daily" this week. In a Slack conversation, I asked her about her path to hosting.
Natalie Kitroeff: O.K.! I started here at The Times as an assistant, left and worked at Bloomberg and then The L.A. Times, and then came back here to cover the industrial economy. Here I am. Can I ask you questions or no?
Michael Barbaro: Not really. Who were you an assistant to?
Natalie: I was an assistant to Nick Kristof and Charles Blow.
Michael: Oh, wow. I had no idea. So you spent time in our Opinion department with the columnists.
Natalie: I did. I was mainly a fact-checker.
Michael: What's your favorite story of checking facts for Nick and Charles?
Natalie: Honestly, the most hilarious moments did not involve fact-checking. They involved being Nick Kristof's travel planner. I had to file expenses for him.
Michael: That man travels. And travels.
Natalie: He would go places and bring back, like, a receipt on a piece of bark. It was hard to file. Then I would need to interface with all these governments that he had recently insulted in a column, to try to get him a visa.
Michael: As in, hi, it's Natalie. I know you are really mad at Nick, but he'd like your permission to enter your country.
Natalie: Exactly. He just called out your dictatorship, but, um, he's on his way!
Michael: So you learn the art of persuasion.
Natalie: Yes. And diplomacy. Also truly learned that if you are straightforward and honest with people, they will respect you.
Michael: Wise words.
Natalie: Even if they don't necessarily adore hearing from you.
Michael: So that naturally leads you to want to report yourself?
Natalie: Yeah, exactly. I caught the bug. Fact-checking is grueling work, but it is also the core of what we do. I liked the precision of it.
Michael: I very much remember your first "Daily" episode, a really eye-opening investigation into pregnancy discrimination, because we all decided immediately that we wanted you back on ASAP, which is what happened.
Natalie: Oh, that's nice.
Michael: And now, from guest ... to guest host. How are you feeling about that?
Natalie: Oof. It's not as easy as impersonating Michael in my living room?
Michael: Hah.
Natalie: No, but seriously, it isn't easy. One of the things about newspaper reporting that I always try to remember is that there is this imbalance built into it -- the things I say don't generally end up in an article, whereas the things people say to me do. But then, on "The Daily," you, as the reporter, are right there in it. Every gasp, every giggle, every ... hmmmm.
Michael: Hmmm. Do you think there are advantages to that? Having a reporter (you) be so present in the conversation?
Natalie: The really nice thing is that there are these moments in reporting that never, ever make it into the newspaper -- moments of levity in a tough call, little tangents that would never make it into the lead of a news story, but are just so deeply a part of what we do. It's nice to feel like we can show people that we are humans, just talking to other humans, trying to figure things out.
Michael: Entirely. There's also just the transparency of hearing both sides of a conversation. Not just one side.
Natalie: Yes! I think that is really important, especially now. With the whole fake news meme.
Michael: What's been the most fun about it?
Natalie: The most fun -- being in the studio with the producers or with you, hearing something incredible in the middle of an interview, and looking up at the producers and making eye contact and just being like, YES! That's amazing!
Michael: Give me an example.
Natalie: Oh, well, when we were talking with Eldon, there was a moment in the middle of the interview where he brought up something that we hadn't really thought about in planning the interview. He pipes up with this smart, thoughtful description of what he's worried about. It was more than just the immediate questions of survival -- will the trade war kill his farm? -- but something much bigger and more diffuse. Will the trade war cause long-term damage to the trading relationships that the U.S. agriculture industry has built up over decades? I looked up at Paige, one of the producers, in that moment, and just shook my head, truly in wonder. Like, wow, this man needs a podcast!
Michael: The Eldon Show. He's one of those guests we end up talking about for years. Like, remember Eldon? Why don't we just call back Eldon and make that an episode?
Natalie: I get that.
Michael: O.K., so, I have to run into a script planning session. But I want to leave with a final question and a thought. You possess this rare combination of intelligence, kindness, authority and wittiness. We like you. Will you agree to host more episodes?
Natalie: Hmmm. Just kidding. Obviously, yes. Please. Whenever. :slightly_smiling_face:
Michael: Wonderful! We'll be in touch.
Natalie: I'm just nervous the world will resist a Barbaro-free episode. Anyway, we can talk about that neurosis later. Byeee!!!
Michael: They crave something new.

About that ending
Many of you wondered why we ended Tuesday's episode about Representative Rashida Tlaib with a quote from President Trump that condemned her statements about the Holocaust and claimed she dislikes Jewish people. Why did we give him the last word? Several factors went into that decision:
1. The president's quote appeared in what we call the "back announce," the final words Michael reads in a segment that update you on what's happened since we recorded an interview. Back announces are, by design, almost always chronological. Events are laid out in the order they happened. In this case, the president's tweet was sent a day after Tlaib decried her critics for "twisting and turning my words." It was the last development.
2. We believed that Tlaib's claim that her words were being taken out of context, juxtaposed with a scolding presidential tweet that offered no context whatsoever, was revealing.
3. Donald Trump is the president. His words and opinions matter. In an episode in which we devoted 30 minutes to having Tlaib tell her story and frame her views, we felt comfortable including the words of one of her most vocal critics: the president of the United States.

What we're listening to
Who: Marc Georges, an editor for "The Daily"
What: "Nerdette Recaps Game of Thrones with Peter Sagal"
The cultural colossus that is "Game of Thrones" will come to an end this weekend. After eight years of political intrigue, zombie fights and dragon fire, we'll finally learn who will sit on the Iron Throne -- for now, at least. I've been watching the show since the beginning and have been rabidly seeking all the extra G.o.T. content I can find.
One of my favorite podcasts that covers the series is "Nerdette Recaps Game of Thrones with Peter Sagal." Yes, that Peter Sagal, from NPR's "Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!" Hosts Greta Johnsen and Tricia Bobeda, along with Peter, have great chemistry on the mic, and the best thing about their podcast is that it doesn't turn into a love fest for G.o.T. The trio take the TV show seriously, and they honestly critique what worked and what didn't. It's a fun hang, and every week I find myself both laughing and nodding along to the crew.

On "The Daily" this week
■ Iran is back on a "collision course" with the U.S., and that may be part of national security adviser John Bolton's plan. Mark Landler explains.
■ "Look how I turned out. I turned out pretty tough." Representative Rashida Tlaib, who's at the center of a new political storm over her comments about Israel, tells us how her upbringing in an immigrant Palestinian family helped shape her political outlook.
■ In the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, much more is at stake than tariffs. "For significant numbers of people, national pride and dignity is on the line," Peter Goodman says.
■ We talked to a farmer in Illinois and a truck manufacturer in Iowa, both supporters of President Trump, who've found themselves caught in the middle of the trade war.
■ Alabama passed a law banning nearly all abortions. The man who wrote the law knew it was unconstitutional, and did it anyway. We asked him why.

'Israel is on the side of God,' U.S. envoy says

Texto completo: JERUSALEM - The U.S. ambassador to Israel, a driving force in crafting the Trump administration's long-awaited proposal to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has declared that Israel is "on the side of God"
Speaking at a celebration sponsored by an American evangelical group to mark the anniversary of the move of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, Ambassador David M. Friedman said that Israel was gaining strength for two reasons.
First, he said, the relationship between the two countries was growing "stronger and stronger and stronger."
"And the second is that Israel has one secret weapon that not too many countries have," Friedman added. "Israel is on the side of God, and we don't underestimate that."
The remark reflected a common belief among evangelical Christians but was also the latest sign of an anything but evenhanded approach to the conflict by the Trump administration.
In addition to moving the embassy to Jerusalem, a move seen as partial to Israel in the dispute over the city's sovereignly, the administration has made deep curs in aid to the Palestinians and stopped referring to the West Bank as "occupied."
Friedman seemed to acknowledge as much moments later, rattling off a litany of other moves the administration has made that broke with precedent in Israel's favor, inducing punishing the Palestinians by closing their diplomatic mission in Washington and merging the formerly independent Jerusalem consulate, which had exclusively dealt with the Palestinians, with the embassy.
Still, the remark set off new howls of criticism, with Palestinians complaining that Friedman was representing the interests of Israel's right-wing government more than those of the United States. Even one of Friedman's predecessors called the statement out of bounds.
"As the ambassador of the far-right Orthodox Jewish community in the United States, Friedman's comment makes sense," said Daniel C. Kurtzer, who was Washington's ambassador in Israel under both Republican and Democratic presidents. "As the supposed ambassador of the United States government and all its people, it is an extremely inappropriate comment."
Palestinians were slack-jawed.
"Where does :hat place the rest of the world?" said Hanan Ashrawi, a veteran Palestinian negotiator and member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee. "I can't believe it. I can't believe this extreme fundamentalist ideologue is an ambassador."
Ashrawi - who said that Monday she had been denied a visa to the United States for the first time - noted that the event at which Friedman had made the remark, with its echoes of religious warfare, was held in a hotel a stone's throw from the walls of the Old City, where crusaders and Muslims had slaughtered one another for centuries.
"The last time we had people thinking that way in Palestine was in the Middle Ages, and look at what happened." Ashrawi said.
Saeo Erekat, the PLO's longtime chief negotiator, questioned the propriety of referring to God as a weapon at all. "What Ambassador Friedman is telling Palestinians, Christians and Muslims," he wrote on Twitter, was "that God is against them (or that they're enemies of God). This was never an American position."
No one has accused Friedman, who was Trump's longtime bankruptcy lawyer, of impartiality in his post, or even of the studied neutrality of career diplomats. Before being appointed he was a prominent supporter of and major donor to the Israeli settlement enterprise in the occupied West Bank, which most of the world considers illegal under international law.
He can also seem to invite charges that he is overly close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel: Opening his remarks Tuesday night, he acknowledged Netanyahu's presence and joked that it had been mere days since they had seen each other, adding, "It's been difficult to be apart from you for so long."
In his speech, Friedman made light of predictions of violence over the move of the embassy to Jerusalem a year ago "In the entire city of Jerusalem that day, I don't think more than 20 people got up to protest," he said. "I think more people were unhappy about the food they were eating in various restaurants than they were about the move of the embassy to Jerusalem.'
He acknowledged that "there was violence that day in Gaza" - where Israeli soldiers killed about 60 Palestinians demonstrating along the border fence - out said it had "nothing to do with the opening of the embassy."
In fact, the protests in Gaza had been mounted that day specifically with the intent of over shadowing the embassy ceremony.
Friedman also said that if he had his way, the U.S. would continue to push the envelope in its support for Israel. "I don't believe in enough," he said.
In a riff about the ancient Jewish Temple, which many right-wing Jews want to rebuild atop the Temple Mount, Friedman, an Orthodox Jew, noted that inside it was an altar built on a ramp. To achieve a certain level of holiness, he said, "you have to keep pushing forward; there are consequences to stopping." He added: "We need to keep moving forward, keep moving up the ramp.'

Building intended for school given to Opelousas

Texto completo: City officials have accepted the donation of a former downtown hotel that once served as a frequent meeting place and restaurant for the Opelousas' central business district and last year was donated to T.M. Landry College Prep.
The Board of Aldermen voted unanimously Tuesday to take possession at no cost of the three-story East Landry Street structure that has remained unoccupied. The building was owned and used by the Diocese of Lafayette as living quarters for a women's shelter. The shelter was transferred to a Lafayette location.
The diocese donated the building to T.M. Landry in 2018. After the private school became the subject of a New York Times article that quoted claims that school administrators abused students and forged college applications, the diocese noted it was not affiliated with it.
City Attorney Travis Broussard and Mayor Julius Alsandor told the aldermen that T.M. Landry school officials have been in negotiations for several months with state Rep. Dustin Miller and municipal officials to finalize the donation agreement and turn the building over to the city.
Broussard urged the aldermen to accept the donation at Tuesday night's meeting. Refusing to do so, Broussard said, might enable the school to look elsewhere at other interested parties seeking to negotiate a donation deal with T.M. Landry.
No representatives from the school spoke at the meeting. The school moved into a building in Lafayette that once housed a skating rink in March.
Since its completion in 1959, the building was known first as the Opelousas Inn and later The Downtowner. For the next 30 years, the hotel was used on a daily basis by businessmen who met there for weekly civic club meetings, luncheons and social events.
The city, according to Alsandor and Broussard, has no immediate plans for the building.
Broussard said the building was abandoned after diocese officials decided they had no use for it. He told the aldermen the building was donated by the diocese to T.M. Landry, but Broussard did not elaborate on the intentions the school may have had.
Two years ago, a representative from Cover Six, a private company that provides nationwide active-shooter training for law enforcement, had proposed using the building, but that plan never developed and the ex-hotel has continued to remain empty.
Broussard did not divulge an appraised value for the building, but he noted that in the diocese's action of donation, it was pointed out that the structure was worth an estimated $100,000.
Purvis Morrison, projects manager for the city, pointed out the building is located in what he called a "prime real estate area," and the city's acquisition costs amounted to nothing.
"This could rejuvenate the downtown area as it tries to move forward," Morrison said. "If the right type of development approaches us, the city could hand over the building and possibly make money, too."
Alsandor said possession of the building offers a number of what he described as "attractive possibilities," although he admitted he does not know its overall condition.

Texto completo: We live in an age of corruption. The age has a soundtrack, with earworms. Among the most insidious is that various important decisions are mainly political. Not legal. Not moral. Not constitutional. So deeply has this idea penetrated that it is now articulated by many who are far removed from the actual practice of corrupt and amoral decision-making.
For instance, there has been a drumbeat of such commentary related to impeachment from highly honorable people. Take my Post colleague Fareed Zakaria, who wrote that impeachment "is, by design, an inherently political process, not a legal one." From Roll Call's John T. Bennett: As "legal scholars and lawmakers from both parties have echoed - impeachment is much more of a political decision than one about criminality." Joe Lockhart, a Clinton-era White House press secretary, argued in the New York Times that, because impeachment is a fundamentally political decision, Democrats should focus on ensuring that President Trump can serve out his term as a way of weakening the Republican Party by locking it into Trumpism. A student said to me over a recent breakfast: "Impeachment is just a political process." This has become the common wisdom of our corrupt era.
In fact, impeachment is a constitutional mechanism, and the Constitution is a legal document. Impeachment is the legal mechanism designed by the framers to permit the republic to hold the president accountable for wrongdoing while in office. True, impeachment does not proceed through the court system - but that makes it no less legal. True, impeachment is a mechanism assigned to Congress and therefore to elected politicians. But plenty of judges throughout this country are elected and are politicians, and that in no way diminishes their responsibility for legal and constitutional procedures.
The earworm extends beyond impeachment. Take CNN anchor Kate Bolduan's question to CNN political director David Chalian in the wake of the news about Sen. Richard Burr's (R-N.C.) subpoena of Donald Trump Jr.: "David, since it all comes down to politics, from the contempt vote to the president trying to block release from anything with executive privilege with regard to the Mueller report, now the threat . . . to subpoena Mueller if they must to get him to testify, now Don Jr. What are people watching play out right now on Capitol Hill?"
In fact, "it" - whatever "it" may be - does not all come down to politics. There are always political elements to our choices, but those should be a matter of tactics, not objectives. Those who think impeachment, or sending a subpoena to Trump Jr., or holding Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt, reduces to a set of political choices confuse two different elements of decision-making.
We need to remember that we make separate decisions about our purposes and about our tactics.
Human beings are purposive creatures. Our purpose may be to pursue the good of our community, power for our party or our own self-interest. What "it" - what human life - fundamentally comes down to is what our purposes are.
Our purposes in turn establish our strategic objectives. We aspire to succeed in realizing our purposes. That aspiration means we must also think tactically, and as a part of this, we make political judgments: Can I best pursue the common good via this or that path? Can I best realize my constitutional responsibilities, and be effective in carrying them out, with this or that method? And, importantly, which method reinforces the purpose I am pursuing? Which undermines it? Our purposes and tactics should align in two ways. Our tactics should effectively deliver success for our objectives. But they should also embody our purposes. If our purpose is the common good, that reduces the set of tactics available to us to those that reinforce commitments to the common good. The ends do not justify the means. They must be implicit in the means.
But it's our overarching purposes that shape our world. If we pursue the common good, and find politically effective ways of doing that, we build healthy societies. The view that everything is "just politics" reduces the world to the amoral pursuit of power or domination over others. If we pursue only power for our party, we create a world riven by amoral efforts at mutual destruction. In other words, we bring war inside our walls. If we pursue only our own self-interest, we destroy the social bonds that enable the growth of social trust - itself a public good that supports wealth, prosperity and broad well-being.
The corruption revealed by the Mueller report might warrant impeachment. But if you hear someone tell you that is a "political" question, don't buy it. The framers certainly did not. They created this legal mechanism as a tool for pursuing the common good, and that's how we should think about it. Otherwise, we've allowed the corruption to enter ourselves.
Can we root out the corruption settling into our souls? Can we recover the capacity to seek out and pursue a common good? These are questions for every single one of us. They are questions about the kind of world in which we wish to live. They could not be more consequential.

Texto completo: NEW YORK (JTA) - A dozen rabbis from across the major denominations met with the publisher and editorial page editor of The New York Times regarding the anti-Semitic cartoon it published and its general coverage of Israel.
The meeting May 8 at The Times offices in Midtown Manhattan lasted an hourand a half and was organized through the New York Board of Rabbis, an interdenominational group. Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, the group's executive vice president, said A.G. Sulzberger and James Bennet, the publisher and editorial page editor, "owned the problem" of the cartoon being anti-Semitic.
Potasnik said the majority of the meeting was spent discussingThe Times' coverage of Israel, which many pro-Israel advocates have long viewed as negative toward the country. He said Sulzberger and Bennet were receptive to the rabbis' comments, and that the group planned on meeting again.
The New York Times declined to comment on the meeting.

Texto completo: The only good thing about Facebook is that no one is required to have an account. I deleted mine a year ago. Now, whenever someone talks about it, I feel like I've gone back in time: People still use Facebook?
Liberals are angry that Facebook didn't do anything about Russians using the platform to spread ridiculous political memes during the 2016 election, obviously stealing the White House from Hillary Clinton. Conservatives are angry that Facebook's algorithm sometimes buries content from right-leaning news websites and because some conservative personalities have had their pages suspended or deleted for any number of dumb reasons.
Others are angry at Facebook for mining their data, having found out that when Mark Zuckerberg asked them if they wanted to "share your location," it wasn't so he could mail them a bag of diamonds.
The solution proposed by nearly all of these people is for the government to do something. In an op-ed last week for the New York Times, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes said the government should "break up" the company by requiring it to spin off its Instagram and WhatsApp messaging properties, regulate how social media platforms protect user privacy, and set up a federal agency to police "acceptable speech" published on those platforms.
There's another option: Users unsatisfied with what Facebook produces (which is nothing) can simply delete their accounts.
Throughout Hughes' op-ed, he harps on all the "power" Zuckerberg has. "Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American," and "[I]t’s his very humanity that makes his unchecked power so problematic."
You would think Zuckerberg is a sexy god.
The only "power" Zuckerberg has is given to him freely by the people using his website. And the site is nothing more than a time suck that might occasionally double as a good social calendar. Facebook isn't a caregiver and it's not a community center.
Zuckerberg never said he was going to take care of his users, and anyone who thought that dumping all of their time and personal information into it deserves what they're getting.
Hughes, in his op-ed, fretted over Facebook's lack of competitors. "Imagine a competitive market," he wrote, "in which [consumers] could choose among one network that offered higher privacy standards, another that cost a fee to join but had little advertising and another that would allow users to customize and tweak their feeds as they saw fit."
But these are apparently things that not enough people care about, because otherwise someone would have invented them already. More importantly, these are not things people need.
Having an account on Facebook, or anything like it, is required for literally nothing.
I wish McDonald's served Maine lobster for $5.99. It doesn't, so I don't go there for Maine lobster. Likewise, Facebook didn't show me the things I wanted to see, didn't bring me any closer to my "friends," and generally didn't offer me anything useful. So I stopped going to Facebook.
True, a lot of people use Facebook to trade information, communicate with their friends and family, and learn about current events. And all of those people are aware that there are infinite other ways to do each of those things outside of that one platform.
Nobody needs the government to help them use Facebook. And if they do, they probably shouldn't be online in the first place.

Poking Around Music Platforms, but Favoring CDs

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ben Sisario, a reporter who covers the music industry, discussed the tech he's using.
What are your most important tech tools for doing your reporting?
Probably 75 percent of my reporting is done by phone and email, and when I am writing I print out drafts and notes. So that part of it is about as current as 1995. But I also use Signal and ProtonMail for sources who require secure communication.
I constantly scan social media -- Twitter, mostly -- for news, and in breaking news situations I sometimes find sources to quote there. But I am wary of letting social media itself tell the story.
You need to actually talk to people, check facts, find contrary viewpoints, weed out nonsense.
When it comes to organizing my work, I think cloud computing is the greatest thing since the manila folder. I have 15-plus years of notes instantly searchable through Dropbox and Google Docs. It's amazing to type in five characters and find that phone number from an obit you wrote a decade ago.
And then there are sites like WhoSampled and Discogs, incredible repositories of information that are deeply addictive for music nerds like me. My time there often starts with legitimate research -- say, checking the original writing credit on an old single -- but then an hour later I've spent $ 50 on vinyl and reminded myself of the slide whistle sample on "Groove Is in the Heart."
What does your music setup look like, and how has it evolved over time?
I try to keep an eye on all the major platforms out there, which means regularly poking around on about a dozen apps. My go-to sources are Spotify, SoundCloud, Bandcamp and Mixcloud, which has excellent D.J.-style mixes and to me feels more human than most.
At home I have a Sonos Play:5 speaker, which plays streaming music and podcasts, and is a piece of cake to use. I also have Google Chromecast Audio, a little plug-in device (now discontinued) that allows me to send high-fidelity streams to my stereo. It sounds better that way, but it's not nearly as easy to use as the Sonos.
To be honest, my preferred way to listen to music is on CD, as unfashionable as that might be. You push a button, the music plays, and then it's over -- no ads, no privacy terrors, no algorithms!
What are the pros and cons of the streaming model for musicians big and small?
The big positive is the vast potential exposure. Streaming eliminated the cost barrier to sampling new music, and playlists constantly put new songs in front of people. Theoretically, at least, there are more chances than ever for a song to be a hit.
But, as they say, you can die of exposure. Megahits still generate millions of dollars in royalties, and Spotify's official mission statement is "giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art."
Yet for artists beneath the megahit level -- and that is the vast majority of them -- the jury is still out. I've seen royalty statements for well-known indie acts that suggest they can earn a decent middle-class living from their streams. I've also talked to very successful songwriters who say their income has been decimated by streaming and by the new model for pop songwriting, in which five or six -- or 30 -- people divvy up the same sliver of royalties.
In general, though, I'm optimistic about streaming and its potential. It has reinvigorated the music industry and made listening a lot easier, more fun and more dynamic.
Apple and Spotify have been fighting publicly over antitrust issues. Where is this fight going, and what impact might it have on streaming music?
I tend to think of this as mostly a matter of corporate warfare. These companies are in a race for market dominance around the world, and the gloves are off. For Spotify, anything that hinders Apple, even a little, can provide an advantage. On the other hand, Apple's gigantic size means it will always be on the defensive against regulation.
I don't see these issues having a big effect on streaming music. Competition in this market has benefited consumers, and as much as Spotify accuses Apple of anticompetitive practices, it has still signed up far more users -- both free and paid -- than Apple Music.
What emerging tech trends might change the way people listen to music?
A great deal of attention is being paid to smart speakers like Amazon's Alexa. This is something that genuinely feels futuristic: walking into a room and saying, "Play relaxation playlist" or "Play NPR news," and it just happens. I think we're still in the early stages of this.
Video sharing apps like TikTok are also having a palpable effect on music, and I think that will only grow. TikTok makes it easy to generate video memes using music, and these are fast moving and viral by nature. The best example is Lil Nas X's song "Old Town Road," which was a TikTok sensation well before it hit the pop charts.
Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?
Not to be too much of a grouch, but for me it is more about an opposite kind of phenomenon: What formerly hyped, supposedly essential technology has since been exposed for gross privacy violations, or for how easily it has become a tool for predatory disinformation?
Way too many of them, of course, but the really dispiriting thing is realizing that it is nearly impossible to disengage. We have become only more conscious of the risks and dangers surrounding us at all times.
That said, in my house we are really happy with our Instant Pot Duo, a beeping digital pressure cooker that makes perfect biriyani or chicken soup in like five minutes. I really hope it is not collecting any private data.

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., may want to reconsider that town hall offer she rejected this week from Fox News.
There is an audience for authentic, left-wing politicians at the infamously right-wing cable network, according to new Morning Consult polling data. In fact, seriously progressive politics are received better by “potential Democratic primary voters” who watch Fox News than those who watch CNN or even MSNBC, according to the group.
For the section titled the “Cable News Primary,” which was conducted between April 25 and May 10 and polled some 33,370 likely Democratic primary voters, the survey’s administrators asked respondents to pick their first choice to run against President Trump in 2020. Former Vice President Joe Biden easily came in first place with 42% of the vote, just as he does in all polls. But that is not the most interesting takeaway. The most interesting takeaway comes when participants’ answers are broken down based on media usage. The data show Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., comes in second with 22% of the vote. At CNN, Sanders polled at only 16% with “potential Democratic primary voters.” At MSNBC, he got an even smaller 13%.
It is no small thing that an unapologetic socialist performs better with “potential Democratic primary voters” who watch Fox News than with those who watch CNN and MSNBC. Also — and this could be a lesson for Warren — Sanders’ placement among Fox News viewers was probably helped by the fact that he participated in a town hall event on the network in April to discuss his 2020 campaign.
[Related: Elizabeth Warren attacks Fox News with video, fundraising]
In a separate subcategory of the Morning Consult survey, the poll’s administrators discovered another interesting detail about likely primary voters’ media consumption habits and their opinion of the 2020 candidates. For potential Democratic voters who read the Wall Street Journal, 19% of them chose Sanders as their choice to run against the president. For respondents who read the Washington Post, the Vermont senator clocked in at a slightly smaller 17%. For New York Times readers, Sanders’ support was also 17%.
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also performed better with likely primary voters who read the Wall Street Journal than with those who read the New York Times. At the former, she scored a 10%, while scoring a smaller 9% with latter. The print outlet numbers are certainly interesting, but remember they fall within the survey’s margin of error.
The cable numbers, on the other hand, are the thing to watch.
They suggest that there is a benefit simply to showing up, as Sanders did when he joined Fox News for a town hall event. Remember, the senator’s appearance on the cable news network last month scored the largest audience of any televised town hall event of this election cycle to date, according to Deadline. Who do you think was watching? The Morning Consult numbers also suggest that there is an audience in the right-leaning sphere for a candidate who is authentic and presents himself exactly as who he is, as Sanders does, even if that candidate is all the way on the fringes of the left wing.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON (AP) - International worries that the Trump administration is sliding toward war with Iran flared into the open Tuesday amid skepticism about its claims that the Islamic Republic poses a growing threat to the U.S. and its allies in the Persian Gulf and beyond .
The U.S. military rebutted doubts expressed by a British general about such a threat. President Donald Trump denied a report that the administration has updated plans to send more than 100,000 troops to counter Iran if necessary. But Trump then stirred the controversy further by saying: "Would I do that? Absolutely."
The general's remarks exposed international skepticism over the American military build-up in the Middle East, a legacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq that was predicated on false intelligence. U.S. officials have not publicly provided any evidence to back up claims of an increased Iranian threat amid other signs of allied unease.
As tensions in the region started to surge, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said his nation was worried about the risk of accidental conflict "with an escalation that is unintended really on either side." Then on Tuesday, Spain temporarily pulled one of its frigates from the U.S.-led combat fleet heading toward the Strait of Hormuz. That was followed by the unusual public challenge to the Trump administration by the general.
"No, there's been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria," said Maj. Gen. Chris Ghika, a senior officer in the U.S.-backed coalition fighting the Islamic State group. Ghika, speaking in a video conference from coalition headquarters in Baghdad, told reporters at the Pentagon that the coalition monitors the presence of Iranian-backed forces "along with a whole range of others because that's the environment we're in."
But he added, "There are a substantial number of militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and we don't see any increased threat from any of them at this stage."
Late in the day, in a rare public rebuttal of an allied military officer, U.S. Central Command said Ghika's remarks "run counter to the identified credible threats" from Iranian-backed forces in the Mideast. In a written statement, Central Command said the coalition in Baghdad has increased the alert level for all service members in Iraq and Syria.
"As a result, (the coalition) is now at a high level of alert as we continue to closely monitor credible and possibly imminent threats to U.S. forces in Iraq," the statement said.
At the White House, Trump, who has repeatedly argued for avoiding long-term conflicts in the Mideast, discounted a New York Times report that the U.S. has updated plans that could send up to 120,000 troops to counter Iran if it attacked American forces.
"Would I do that? Absolutely," he told reporters. "But we have not planned for that. Hopefully we're not going to have to plan for that. If we did that, we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that."
Reinforcing Trump's denial, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a joint news conference in Sochi with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, "We fundamentally do not seek war with Iran."
A Trump administration official said a recent small meeting of national security officials was not focused on a military response to Iran, but instead concentrated on a range of other policy options, including diplomacy and economic sanctions. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Lavrov said Pompeo told him that a potential deployment of 120,000 U.S. troops to the Mideast was only a "rumor." Lavrov said the international community needs to focus on diplomacy with Iran, including on the potentially explosive issue of Iran's nuclear program, which is constrained by a U.S.-brokered deal in 2015 that Trump has abandoned.
U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook told reporters traveling with Pompeo in Brussels that the secretary of state shared intelligence on Iran with allies since "Europe shares our concerns about stability in the Gulf and the Middle East." What the Europeans do not share, however, is Washington's more aggressive approach to Iran.
"We are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident, with an escalation that is unintended really on either side but ends with some kind of conflict," British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told reporters in Brussels.
"What we need is a period of calm to make sure that everyone understands what the other side is thinking," Hunt said.
Last week, U.S. officials said they had detected signs of Iranian preparations for potential attacks on U.S. forces and interests in the Mideast, but Washington has not spelled out that threat.
The U.S. has about 5,000 troops in Iraq and about 2,000 in Syria as part of the coalition campaign to defeat the Islamic State group there. It also has long had a variety of air and naval forces stationed in Bahrain, Qatar and elsewhere in the Gulf, partly to support military operations against IS and partly as a counter to Iranian influence.
Gen. Ghika's comments came amid dramatically heightened tensions in the Middle East. The U.S. in recent days has ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Gulf region, plus four B-52 bombers. It also is moving a Patriot air-defense missile battery to an undisclosed country in the area. As of Tuesday, the Lincoln and its strike group had passed through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea, but officials would not disclose their exact location.
Tensions rose another notch with reports Sunday that four commercial vessels anchored off the United Arab Emirates had been damaged by sabotage.
A U.S. military team was sent to the UAE to investigate, and one U.S. official said the initial assessment is that each ship has a 5- to 10-foot hole in it, near or just below the water line. The official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation, said the early interpretation is that the holes were caused by explosive charges.
The official on Tuesday acknowledged seeing some photographs of the damage to the ships, but those images have not been made public. The official also said that the team is continuing to conduct forensic testing on the ship damage and that U.S. leaders are still awaiting the final report. The team's initial assessment is that the damage was done by Iranian or Iranian-backed proxies, but they are still going through the evidence and have not yet reached a final conclusion, the official said.

Texto completo: Community's silence thwarts police in WPB
Mayor Keith James has had much to say about the crime problem in a particular community. He seems to believe that this is a result of a policing problem and he blames Chief Sarah Mooney. I believe he is mistaken. I retired after 30 years with this department, 9 1/2 years of which I patrolled this neighborhood at night.
The problem in this community is the concept of "no snitch." The leaders in this community know this exists and seem to ignore the problem and prefer to blame everybody but those responsible. If you want a safe neighborhood, then you have to do your part, tell the police what you witnessed and let the court system deal with those causing the problem.
I have known every chief since Bill Barnes and none has had the confidence and loyalty of the rank and file like Chief Mooney. Replacing her would be unfair to everyone involved.
Ralph Kinser Jr., Palm Beach Gardens
Editor’s note: Kinser is a retired sergeant, West Palm Beach Police Department. Mayor James demoted Mooney on Tuesday, replacing her with former Fort Lauderdale Chief Frank Adderley.
All Americans should shun Chinese products
I do not like losing money in the stock market due to an intransigent country that has been for decades taking advantage of our presidents who have given away the store. Since we have a greater economy now, we can more easily overcome tariffs and unfair trading, and especially theft of our intellectual property. That is only the start of our problems with China.
Every American now should stop buying Chinese products until they realize they have 1.5 billion people who need to have jobs and feed themselves. If we boycott Chinese products, thousands of containers will get here with unsold goods. They cannot handle this too long.
Do not buy Chinese goods until they make a deal with our courageous president to stop what they have been doing for decades.
Steve Landes, Boynton Beach
Trump's tax returns show system tilts toward the rich
Our president says that no one cares about his tax returns, but I beg to differ. The New York Times reported that between 1985 and 1994, Donald Trump lost $1.7 billion, more money than nearly any other individual in America, and, as a result, paid no federal taxes for eight of those years. I have always had the feeling that the reason he failed to disclose his current taxes is because the situation is more of the same, not because he is under audit.
I find it strange that despite these monumental losses, he lives a life that even potentates would envy.
This man who thinks paying taxes is be avoided and a smart thing to do, is entrusted with overseeing the dispersal of billions of dollars of money that people like me — who sends at least a quarter of my income to Washington each year — must do or face penalties and fines.
If people feel the system is rigged in favor of the rich fat cats, who can blame them?
Dianne Golder, West Palm Beach
Earth, Wind and Fire set SunFest alight
Kudos to SunFest for including Earth, Wind and Fire in the lineup this year. EWF did not disappoint on the campus of Florida A&M University in 1975 and certainly not Friday night.
Could Babyface, The Whispers or Cameo be on the horizon for next year?

Texto completo: Cultural critic Damon Young is known for using his platform to demonstrate and explain the intricacies of blackness. His blog, Very Smart Brothas, was acquired by The Root (an online magazine centering on issues that affect the black community) in 2017 and is a brave exploration of how race, pop culture, and politics all intersect. 
Mr. Young is also a columnist at GQ.com, and his work has been featured in publications like Ebony, The Washington Post, and The New York Times. From the effects of white supremacy to the complexities of colorism, Mr. Young’s voice, observers say, is a critical one when it comes to amplifying the unique and difficult nature of the black male experience. Humor is often his vehicle of choice. 
“[L]iving while black has provided me with enough thrills to make Wes Craven scream,” he writes in the introduction to “What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Blacker,” his memoir in essays,   released earlier this spring. “Whenever I am followed by a police officer while driving, for instance, the theme song from “Mission: Impossible” plays on a loop in my head, and the mental checklist I run through reminds me of [action hero] Ethan Hunt attempting to defuse a nuclear warhead.
‘OK, people. Relax. Stay calm, and do exactly what I tell you. Make a sharp right at this light to see if he’s following us or just happens to be behind us.’”  
“What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Blacker” chronicles not only Mr. Young’s life but how outside – and institutional – forces affect it. With startling self-awareness, he dives deep into the encounters, moments, and relationships that have shaped him.
“Each chapter in the book, even though it delves into very specific parts of my life, injects larger things into it. There are critiques of masculinity, critiques of patriarchy, critiques of race and racism, critiques of myself,” Mr. Young explains in a phone interview.
The book examines the prevalence of overlapping forms of discrimination, classism, and otherness in the era of Trump and the microaggressions that black people routinely deal with but which fail to make their way into larger conversations. Mr. Young says that the narrative surrounding black folk is two-dimensional and typically oscillates between trauma and excellence. He is working to change that.
“When America focuses on us, they tend to focus on the two extreme ends of the spectrum, but we have all of this abundance within us, all of this beauty. We talk about love; we talk about pain; we talk about chicken wings   and have arguments about which ones are better, flats or drums.” Mr. Young coyly adds, “The answer is flats, by the way. Ultimately, I wanted to create a thing that was authentic and was as true to my experience as it could possibly be. That’s what I hope I’ve done.”
From racist epithets being hurled at his family that resulted in a volatile confrontation when he was just 6 years old to disclosing his fears when it comes to raising his daughter, Mr. Young knows that it’s the broader themes that will captivate audiences. 
“I’m not Michelle Obama. ... I’m not Black Panther. No one really cares that much about my biography or where I went to school or how I met my wife,” he says with a slight chuckle. “What people care about are the connective things that we all share: the angst, the anxieties, the neuroses, the vulnerabilities.”  
Mr. Young has been writing professionally for more than a decade, and identity has saturated a significant amount of his work. He says that it is integral in his memoir   and only strengthened its message. “I didn’t set out to write a black book. I set out to write a book about   me. But blackness is a central part of me. Anything I do or create is black by virtue of me doing it.” 
He expounds on that in an essay about his daughter. “Blackness forces you to love harder,” he writes. “It forces you to entertain the concept of forgiveness and choose whether it’s a thing you’re interested in possessing. It forces your hugs and your kisses and your daps to be tighter and longer, like a book you read ever so slowly because you’re not quite ready for it to end. It forces improvisation to be an immutable function of life.”
Elsewhere he takes on white privilege and how it is perpetuated by the feelings and opinions of white people counting more than the feelings and opinions of those who are not white. “It’s not so much that blacks are thought to be subhuman, although that belief festers too. It’s that the humanity of whites is the only humanity that matters. Their humanity is the standard all other humanities are judged by.”
National Book Award-winning author Ibram Kendi, offering praise ahead of the memoir’s release, called it “unobstructed and unsanitized” and applauded Mr. Young for being brave enough to write it. Still, Mr. Young’s unfiltered, sometimes R-rated, approach is perhaps not for everyone, and even he is anxious and “terrified” at times about the process and how people will react to his work. 
“I write a lot about anxiety and self-consciousness, but I’m a bit more confident than I give myself credit for. I put very personal things into these essays, and it’s been very cathartic and therapeutic.” He adds, “I didn’t think I had it in me to write something so vulnerable.”

Better watch out, future lunar colonists. There are quakes up there

Texto completo: In the future, someone on a moon base may look up from a computer screen and feel the rumblings of a moonquake. New research released this week may ensure that those rumblings are distant and faint, and the astronaut can get back to work.
A team of scientists, including a geology professor from Wheaton College, has found that the moon, rather than just being a dead rock, may be geologically alive.
“The moon is our closest neighbor," professor Geoffrey Collins said on the Wheaton College news site. “It's one of the places in the universe that we thought we understood the best, and part of what we thought we understood about the surface of the moon was that nothing has been happening there for a long time. That appears not to be true."
The research was published Monday in Nature Geoscience.
“Our analysis gives the first evidence that [faults on the moon] are still active and likely producing moonquakes today as the Moon continues to gradually cool and shrink," said Thomas Watters, senior scientist at the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington.
“Some of these quakes can be fairly strong, around five on the Richter scale," Watters, lead author of the paper, said in a statement from NASA.
The research could help planners to keep future moon bases away from moonquake trouble, Collins said in a telephone interview.
“While these moonquakes that were detected were maybe small by California standards, they were still big enough that you'd have to worry about them if you were to build a lunar base next to one of those faults," he said.
Scientists studied readings from seismometers placed on the moon's surface during the Apollo 12, 14, 15, and 16 missions. They recorded 28 shallow moonquakes from 1969 to 1977, ranging from around 2 to 5 on the Richter scale, NASA said.
They used a new algorithm designed to determine quake locations from a sparse seismic network and developed moonquake location estimates, NASA said.
“We have much better algorithms now than they did in the 1970s for determining where a quake occurs, even if you only have a few stations recording it," Collins said on the Wheaton news site. “Advances in computing have made it possible to locate much more precisely where these shallow moonquakes were happening."
The scientists found that eight of the 28 quakes were within 18.6 miles of “thrust faults" visible in lunar images, which, NASA said, was “close enough to attribute the quakes to the faults."
The thrust faults are formed when one section of crust is pushed up over a neighboring part, as the moon shrinks, NASA said.
The analysis also found that six of the eight quakes happened when the moon was at or near its apogee, its farthest point from Earth in orbit. That would cause tidal stress from gravity, making fault slippage more likely.
Watters said a combination of the two forces was thus probably at play.
“We think it's very likely that these eight quakes were produced by faults slipping as stress built up when the lunar crust was compressed by global contraction and tidal forces," Watters said.
Collins did research on tidal forces on the moons of giant planets, such as Jupiter, and how they cause the buildup of geological stresses. His computer models showed the correlation between the time and location of the moonquakes and the gravitational influence of the Earth on the moon.
Collins said one of the moons he studies is Jupiter's Europa, which has a big ocean under an icy surface that is affected by the gravitational pull of a giant planet. “It's just a more obvious process" there, he said.
On our moon, where there is no water, it's “more subtle," he said in the interview.
“It took us going out to look at the moons of Jupiter and Saturn to realize how important some of these tidal forces are," Collins said. “Now we realize, after looking at other moons, that our own moon is undergoing the same forces."
NASA noted that highly detailed images of the moon by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft showed landslides or boulders at the bottom of relatively bright patches on fault scarps, suggesting a recent moonquake had sent materials sliding down a cliff. Other images showed tracks from boulder falls, suggesting boulders had rolled down a cliff.
Anna Horleston, a planetary seismologist and member of the InSight mission on Mars — which recently detected its first marsquake — told The New York Times the study's data look solid, but “it would be awesome to get more seismometers on the moon and to test this out properly."
The new study comes as NASA plans to land the first man and the first woman at the south pole of the moon by 2024, in what it's dubbed the Artemis project. Artemis was Apollo's sister in Greek mythology.

Texto completo: TV Q&A

The current "Jeopardy!" champion, James Holzhauer, has racked up over $1.6 million and is going strong. I wondered how his compensation is paid. Is he given installments until he loses or must he wait until the end of his run?

Apparently he has to wait not only until the end of his run, but until his last show airs -- which could be months after it was taped. That, according to various reports, keeps contestants from violating signed agreements not to reveal the outcome of their performance until after audiences have had a chance to see it.

And the check may take still longer to arrive. Newsweek.com noted recently that one winner earlier this year was told her check would arrive 120 days after her last telecast.

There used to be a special years ago, before Christmas, called "Amahl and the Night Visitors." Any idea what ever happened to it? I haven't seen it in years!

"Amahl," which aired for the first time on NBC on Christmas Eve 1951, was composed by Gian Carlo Menotti and is considered the first opera written especially for television. About a boy who encounters the Three Wise Men on their way to the infant Jesus, the hourlong show was sponsored by Hallmark, setting the stage for its "Hallmark Hall of Fame" presentations in ensuing decades.

"Amahl" drew raves, won a Peabody Award and became a holiday season perennial (in live and taped renditions) for 15 years. There were also staged theater productions around the country.

But Menotti was unhappy with a '60s production that he had neither supervised nor approved in advance and refused to allow further TV presentations when he regained the rights to the opera. "I'd rather see no production at all of ‘Amahl' than a bad one," he told the New York Times in 1966. Menotti and NBC did agree to a new telecast in 1978, with him as music director. It was not a success. Still, companies continue to stage "Amahl." And you can find various versions online; YouTube has 1951's and 1978's. There's also a DVD of a 1955 telecast.

There was a show on television a few years ago called "The Lost World." It lasted three seasons. The last episode ended by saying "to be continued" but it never did. I was wondering if you could find out why.

The officially titled "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World" aired for three seasons in 1999-2002. According to The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, there was supposed to be a fourth season "but the producers ran into financial problems that prevented its continuing in production."

It was even worse than that: Told a fourth season would happen, writers on the show built a cliffhanger into the third season finale and began extensive planning for a fourth run. While the fourth did not happen, there's a long written discussion of what the writers had in mind at www.reeves-stevens.com/TLWSUMMARY1.pdf.

What happened to "Sun Records" on CMT? Will it ever come back?

As Elvis Presley would say, it's gone, gone, gone. The series about the early years of Sun ended after a single, eight-episode season in 2017.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is struggling to present a unified message on Iran with one high-profile military official undercutting the basis for his administration's confrontational strategy and outside experts increasingly questioning the U. S. endgame.
As bombers recently deployed to the Middle East flew their first message-sending sorties, the president appeared to be caught between hard line advisers calling for more aggressive action against Tehran and others attempting to avoid an escalation.
In a remarkable break with the Trump administration, a British general who is the No. 2 officer in the U. S. -led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq said Tuesday that the threat from Iran is no greater than it was months ago, drawing a quick rebuke from the Pentagon.
Trump, meanwhile, dismissed a report he is planning to send additional troops to the Middle East but also insisted he would do so "absolutely" if needed.
"I really don’t see any benefit from the contradictory messaging," said John McLaughlin, a former deputy director at the CIA who teaches at the Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. "It leaves the Iranians confused, our allies discouraged, and the American public puzzled and concerned. "
Clearing out: U. S. Embassy orders staff to leave Iraq amid Iran tensions
New threats: Iran says Trump playing 'very dangerous game,' risking 'devastating war'
All of the saber rattling left some experts questioning whether the White House is attempting to repeat the aggressive stance it took toward North Korea before then softening the rhetoric in exchange for temporary concessions Trump used to claim success. Experts have questioned the strategy after Kim Jong Un restarted missile tests shortly after Trump praised the North Korea leader for suspending them.
Trump v. Iran
Tension with Iran began to rise this month when John Bolton, Trump’s National Security Advisor, announced that the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and warships that travel with her were steaming to the region ahead of schedule.
A group of bombers was also dispatched as Bolton cited increasing alarm over threats to the thousands of U. S. troops in the region.
The next day, Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers noted “indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against U. S. forces and our interests. ”
Ominously, the Pentagon announced the bombers were B-52s. Though the Stratofortress aircraft first flew in the Cold War, the huge warplanes have been updated and can loiter aloft with an arsenal of sophisticated weaponry that can be launched from a safe distance at targets inside Iran.
Troops report: Trump dismisses report of plan to send troops to Middle East
Two days after Bolton’s announcement, Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U. S. Central Command, said the military had detected “credible threat streams emanating from the regime in Iran throughout the CENTCOM area of responsibility. ”
By the end of the week, the Pentagon announced it was bolstering the force, sending a Marine transport ship, the USS Arlington, and Patriot air-defense missiles to the region. Marine Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, who commands U. S. forces in the Middle East, had made the request for additional forces, the Pentagon revealed.
Meantime, senior military officials, including Patrick Shanahan, the acting Defense Secretary, met quietly on Thursday to develop plans to send as many as 120,000 U. S. troops to the region, according to the New York Times.
What's the latest?
Trump offered somewhat contradictory statements Tuesday. Asked about the New York Times report that the administration was considering sending 120,000 troops , the president said no such plans are in the works.
But then, in the next breath, he ratcheted up his anti-Iran rhetoric.
"Would I do that? Absolutely," Trump said of troops. If the administration decided to deploy soldiers to the region, he said, "we’d send a hell of lot more troops than that. "
Hours later, British Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, the No. 2 officer in Operation Inherent Resolve, told Pentagon reporters the threat from Iran was, in fact, not higher than it was months ago.
His comments were at odds with U. S. officials, and Capt. Urban, the spokesman for U. S. Central Command, said in a statement that Ghrika is wrong.
Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cautioned against reading too much into the apparent disagreement between coalition officials.
A "threat includes intent to pull the trigger, not just capability – not just more preparatory activity," he said. "So until the trigger is, in fact, pulled, one can have a full and rich debate. "
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was traveling in Russia on Tuesday, appeared to tamp down escalating tensions.
"We fundamentally do not see a war with Iran," Pompeo said when asked about the New York Times report during a news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He said the U. S. wants Iran to stop funding terrorist groups and "behave like a normal country. "
What does Iran say?
A senior Iranian official warned Tuesday that the U. S. is playing a "very dangerous game" and suggested Trump could "drag Iran into an unnecessary war. "
Hamid Baeidinejad, Iran’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, said Trump made a "serious miscalculation" in deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, B-52 bombers and other military personnel and equipment to the Persian Gulf to counter alleged, unspecified Iranian threats.
Baeidinejad denied that Iran or its "proxies" were behind what Washington described as the "sabotage" of oil tankers in the Gulf belonging to Saudi Arabia, Norway and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia said drones attacked one of its oil pipelines and other energy infrastructure, an incident that caused global oil price benchmarks to jump.
"We are prepared for any eventuality," Baeidinejad said. "This I can tell you. "

Russia and the 5G Cancer Scare

Texto completo: Above the fold on the front page of the New York Times, by the paper's seasoned science reporter, William Broad, came a story that could only have the cell-phone industry saying "yippee."
RT, the Moscow-backed, U.S.-based television network that U.S. intelligence identified as a "principal meddler in the 2016 presidential election," is promoting for U.S. audiences a claim that 5G wireless is a menace to public health, causing "brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors and Alzheimer's disease."
"It's economic warfare," a source told the paper. "Russia doesn't have a good 5G play, so it tries to undermine and discredit ours."
Splashy national news stories often are not as original as they seem. A tech news site, Fudzilla, so unprepossessing that it recently fought a battle with Wikipedia over whether it deserved an entry, was already on the story months ago, and provided useful context: Conspiratorial websites, including that of Infowars impresario Alex Jones, have been pushing 5G alarmism for more than a year. All have been playing off decades of activist scare-mongering that has underlain so much opposition around the country to cellphone towers, power lines and even airport landing systems.
This noise brigade all stems, in a sense, from the same august source: a series of articles published by the New Yorker magazine in the late 1980s and early 1990s alleging a massive coverup of health effects of nonionizing radiation produced by many kinds of electrical appliances.
A cottage industry has been with us ever since. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the U.S. government disallowed health claims as a reason to block cellphone towers. Yet last year its own National Toxicology Program produced a $25 million study showing that a small percentage of male (but not female) rodents developed a certain type of cancer when bathed in 2G and 3G emissions for an extended period.
The respectable left-wing magazine the Nation produced a lengthy article last year accusing industry and government of a 5G coverup. A group of scientists and technologists calling themselves the 5G Appeal demands a moratorium on deployment. As far back as 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which considers everything a cancer risk until proven otherwise, decided cellphone use was a possible carcinogen.
For the sake of having a complete record, this column once urged a hunt for a Russian role in promoting the 9/11 truther and Obama birther conspiracies. In 2014, the head of NATO candidly accused Russia of backing the anti-fracking efforts of environmentalists. And yet does anybody think these hobby horses would not have sustained themselves without Russia's help?
Not only will the Kremlin's anti-5G efforts likely be devoid of influence, they will be a boon to those pushing back. The Times story is valuable precisely for showing how easily Russia's efforts can be neutralized just by calling attention to them.
Alas, a new cottage industry has been born -- devoted to exaggerating the competence and potency of Russian propaganda tactics. And it's hard not to see a connection to the grand illusion that continues to animate America's media and political firmament, namely that Trump voters were fooled into pulling the lever for him.
For the third time since it tried to inject an October surprise before Election Day in 2016, the New York Times last week unleashed another "investigation" of Mr. Trump's tax history that amounts to yet another least-interesting version of the most-told story about Mr. Trump -- his debt-fueled meltdown of the early 1990s.
Immediately pilot fish at the New Yorker, Slate and other publications rushed out pieces calling Mr. Trump "the worst businessman in America" and a "reckless conman who burned money."
We'll spare you the details. Unlike many businesses, Mr. Trump ran his losses through his personal tax return. That's the sole basis for the paper's excited claim that he "lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer." The same 1990-91 recession that nearly took down Mr. Trump also nearly took down Rupert Murdoch's burgeoning Fox media empire. It sank two of the country's biggest regional banks, Security Pacific and Bank of New England, as well as other enterprises whose losses mostly appeared on corporate, rather than personal, income statements.
Mr. Trump wasn't the first and won't be the last to seek billionairehood by owning businesses on credit. Though it won't earn any business hagiographies, his resurrection, by peddling himself as a gold-plated wheeler-dealer, was also some kind of feat, leading to his NBC show and the presidency.
We in the press fool ourselves if we think the public needs to be disabused about his history. Mr. Trump was the most known presidential candidate ever. And soon, of course, voters will have even more relevant data to inform their 2020 vote: four years of a Trump presidency.

Texto completo: Activist and former soldier Chelsea Manning will tell her life story in a memoir set for release next year.
Manning, who spent seven years in prison for leaking thousands of documents related to the Iraq war to the website WikiLeaks, is writing the book for publisher Farrar, Straus & Giroux, the publisher told the New York Times.
Manning told the Times that the memoir is essentially a "coming-of-age story."

"It's basically my life story up until I got the commutation, from my birth to my time in school and going to the Army and going to prison and the court-martial process," she said. "It's a personal narrative of what was going on in my life surrounding that time and what led to the leaks, what led to prison, and how this whole ordeal has really shaped me and changed me."
Manning, then an Army intelligence analyst stationed in Iraq, was arrested in 2010 after sending more than 700,000 classified or sensitive documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to WikiLeaks.
She was court-martialed and, in 2013, was convicted of 17 charges including espionage. A judge sentenced her to 35 years in prison, and she was dishonorably discharged from the Army.
In 2017, President Obama commuted her sentence, and she left prison after serving seven years.
She returned to jail this year after being held in contempt for refusing to testify to a grand jury. She was released this month after the expiration of the grand jury's term but could return if she refuses to testify to the new grand jury.
Manning told the New York Times that there are some aspects of the trial that she won't be able to discuss in the book.
"I'm still under obligation under the court rules and the Classified Information Procedures Act of 1980 to not disclose closed court-martial testimony or verify evidence that was put in the record. Things like that," she said. "So I can't talk about that stuff and I'm not going to, and so I'm trying to keep this and maintain this as more of a personal story."
Manning indicated that the book would touch on her gender. In 2013, she came out as a transgender woman.
"I'm really opening myself up to some really intimate things in this book, some really very personal moments and much more intimate points of my life that I've never disclosed before," she said. "You're probably going to learn more about my love life than about the disclosures."
Manning's memoir, as yet untitled, is set for release in the winter of 2020.

Tampa gets a savory clue

Texto completo: Sundays New York Times crossword offered a polarizing clue for Florida readers: City famous for its Cuban sandwiches.

The answer for 1 Down contained five spaces. Both Tampa and Miami, cities that are, in fact, famous for their Cuban sandwiches, consist of five letters, making it a difficult wager.

Yet the clue for 1 Across was whole lot, which could be substituted with the word ton. So a city famous for Cuban sandwiches that begins with a T? The answer becomes a whole lot more clear.

Miami and Tampa are constantly waging a war for the crown of the original and best Cuban sandwich. It is considered one of the states most iconic foods, so the war has significance. One of the Tampa BayTimes reporters, Christopher Spata, actually created National Cuban Sandwich Day in 2016. Thats August 23, for those who dont know.

In 2012, the Tampa City Council voted the historic Tampa Cuban sandwich as the official sandwich of the city of Tampa. That sandwich must include: Cuban bread with a leaf from a palm frond, ham, mojo roast pork, Genoa salami, Swiss cheese, yellow mustard and three dill pickle slices, but no mayonnaise.

Sen. Marco Rubio served a controversial opinion last month when he said Tampa bakery La Segunda had the best Cuban bread in the state. The Food Network named the Cuban at Tampas Columbia restaurant as the standard.

In its daily crossword column, the New York Times noted that it has waded into controversial territory with its crossword answer. The crossword was penned by University of Minnesota biomedical engineering professor Victor Barocas.

I recently learned that the Cuban sandwich is really Floridian, but it turns out that theres a real turf war for ownership between Miami and Tampa, wrote the New York Times Caitlin Lovinger. We know where Professor Barocass allegiances lie, and hes in the majority if you go by this NPR poll  which includes the decisive information that Tampa sends bread to Miami for its Cubanos. Nuff said.

In 2012, 57 percent of NPR listeners chose Tampa over Miami as the first city for the Cuban sandwich. The New York Times Crossword answers site confirms the correct response is Tampa.

Texto completo: I am not going to write "a beautiful letter" to Premier Donald Trump, the kind he likes to get from fellow autocrats.
But I have to give him credit for one thing.
When Trump fatigue seemed to set in after the Mueller report, with cable network ratings dropping, I had total faith that Mr. Trump and his crazy posse would find some bizarre way to grab back the spotlight.
And, indeed, what could be more insane than this? A president who has spent two years battling accusations that he colluded with a foreign power to fix the 2016 election manages to wriggle off the hook. Just three weeks later, his lawyer unveils their 2020 plan: to collude with a foreign power to fix the election.
"We're not meddling in an election," Rudy Giuliani protested to The New York Times. "We're meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do."
Mr. Giuliani had his bags packed for a trip to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, to meet with the president-elect - who made his name playing a president on a TV comedy. Rudy wanted to stir up investigations that might buoy any one of the president's febrile rants about Ukrainian connections to "the dirty dossier," the origins of the "witch hunt" and, of course, how all of it leads back to Hillary and the Democrats.
And, while he was over there, Mr. Giuliani planned to pick up some fresh ammo to use against Joe Biden, who served on the board of a company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, in an effort to hurt the Democratic rival he now calls "SleepyCreepy Joe."
After an uproar, Mr. Giuliani canceled the trip late Friday night, saying he thought he was being "set up," and that Democrats were trying to "spin" the trip.
Volume I of the Mueller report garnered less attention than Volume II, but in some ways was more chilling. The Russian spies, hackers and cyberteams who aimed to upend the 2016 election "in sweeping and systematic fashion," as the Mueller report put it, were far more efficient and successful than the Russians who met with Donald Trump Jr. in Trump Tower.
The elder Mr. Trump's former homeland security chief, Kirstjen Nielsen, was told not to talk to the president about plans to protect America from Russian interference in the next election. He's putting his hands over his ears on this one. He didn't even bother to bring it up in his recent phone call with his pal Vlad.
Volume I is dispiriting, both because of the specter that the Russians are coming for us again with our digital defenses down, and because of the sad arc it unspools about the existential perils of social media.
George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld dragged us into the past. Still stung by rollbacks of presidential power after Watergate, Richard Nixon acolytes Cheney and Rumsfeld had pushed for extreme executive privilege and for America to be a swaggering hyperpower in the world. They mired us in two interminable wars in Flintstones territory when we should have been looking ahead.
When Barack Obama was elected, it felt like we were moving to a bold, gleaming future with a young, appealing president who would reposition America to deal with Asia, A.I., globalization and all the fresh challenges of the 21st century.
But Mr. Obama's presidency was bogged down by W.'s epic mistakes and his own professorial aloofness. The fears and ire of Americans who felt displaced and left behind intensified and metastasized across social media. We learned the dark side of the fiendish little devices that were supposed to make our lives brighter, and the avaricious side of the lords of the cloud, who turned out to have world domination dreams that rivaled Mr. Cheney's. Silicon Valley's touted utopia helped deliver our current dystopia.
"Collectively," the Mueller report said, the social media accounts of the Russian troll farms and bots, pretending to be American activists, "reached tens of millions of U.S. persons."
Boosted by all the phony content on social media during the campaign, and by his own adeptness using Twitter as a saber, Mr. Trump got into the White House and began yanking us back to the '50s - on abortion, on climate change, on women's rights, on regulations. Most devastatingly, he's turning back the clock with the judiciary.
Mr. Trump always seems like someone who walked out of a Vegas steam bath in 1959. And now the whole country is starting to smell of moth balls.
When the Vatican complains that you're dragging the U.S. "back to the past," you know you're in trouble.
Besides Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. Trump is the most successful exploiter of social media in history - and he's 72.
Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is not the perfect messenger. He stumbled into a fortune based on a lucky roommate situation and then used it to trash the venerable New Republic magazine and help bungle a swing district for the Democrats. But he is correct that Mr. Zuckerberg's unbridled power is frightening; it's a story straight out of Mary Shelley.
"Mark may never have a boss, but he needs to have some check on his power," Mr. Hughes wrote in a searing New York Times op-ed piece. "The American government needs to do two things: Break up Facebook's monopoly and regulate the company to make it more accountable to the American people."
It's time for all our social-media-addicted dictators - in the D.C. swamp and in Silicon Valley - to have their wings clipped.

Losing income tax privacy is a real danger: Ron Paul

Autor: Paul, Ron. 

Información de publicación: Press - Telegram ; Long Beach, Calif. [Long Beach, Calif]. 13 May 2019.

Texto completo: Last week the New York Times published some of President Trump’s 1980s and 1990s tax return information.
The information detailed President Trump’s financial difficulties during that time. While you would not know it from reading some media reports, this is old news. In fact, President Trump openly discussed his financial difficulties on his popular reality television show.
What should be of great concern is the possibility that the person who leaked the returns — who the paper says has legal access to President Trump’s tax records — is an IRS employee seeking to undermine the president. This would hardly be the first time an IRS employee has leaked confidential information because he disagreed with the taxpayer’s politics. In 2014 the agency had to pay the National Organization for Marriage $50,000 dollars after an IRS employee gave names of the group’s donors to the group’s opponents.
In 2014-2017, my Campaign for Liberty group was repeatedly threatened by the IRS because it refused to give the agency the names of and other information about its top supporters. Fortunately, the IRS rescinded the regulation forcing groups like Campaign for Liberty to violate supporters’ privacy or face legal penalties. However, campaign finance reform legislation that recently passed in the House of Representatives would require the IRS to resume collecting this information, and the New York attorney general is suing the IRS to force the agency to reinstate the regulation.
The right of groups like Campaign for Liberty to protect their supporters’ privacy was upheld by the Supreme Court in NAACP v. Alabama. As Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, “Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.”
Traditionally, presidents have used the IRS to harass their political opponents instead of presidents’ opponents using the IRS against them. Franklin Roosevelt audited people critical of the New Deal and supportive of the America First movement. Lyndon Johnson ordered audits of opponents, and John Kennedy shared tax return information with Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.
During the Obama administration, the IRS targeted groups opposing Obamacare. The agency went after anti-Iraq War groups during the George W. Bush years.
If the Times did obtain Trump’s tax returns information from an IRS employee, that employee is not in the same category as whistleblowers like Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning who exposed government wrongdoing. The leaker or leakers of President Trump’s information are releasing private tax information.
The IRS regularly violates the civil liberties of taxpayers. In fact, the income tax system forcing taxpayers to reveal potentially incriminating information on their tax returns violates the principles of a free society. Americans’ liberty and prosperity will never be secure until Congress repeals two great mistakes of 1913: the income tax and the Federal Reserve.
Dr. Ron Paul is a former member of the House of Representatives. This article was written for and published by the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.

Rosenstein criticizes Comey: The former FBI director 'acting as a partisan pundit'

Texto completo: Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Monday evening bashed James Comey as a "partisan pundit," several days after the former FBI director criticized Rosenstein's character.
During remarks to the Greater Baltimore Committee, Rosenstein, just days removed from his tumultuous tenure helping to lead the Justice Department for the past two years, defended his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe and responded to remarks his former colleague made about him last week.
Rosenstein said that during Comey's time as FBI director, he did not dislike him: "At the time, I admired him personally and appreciated some of his accomplishments at the FBI. "
More: Comey: 'No doubt' Trump would be charged with obstruction if not president
However, Rosenstein said that Comey made some mistakes, which crossed "bright lines that should never be crossed. " The former deputy attorney general critiqued Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation during the 2016 presidential race.
He went on to respond to criticism from the former FBI director, who said last week during a televised CNN town hall that he does not believe Rosenstein has "strong character. "
"But now the former director seems to be acting as a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul. I kid you not," Rosenstein said during his remarks Monday
"That is disappointing. Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors," he continued.
More: Comey: US not in a constitutional crisis, but 'our system is being stress-tested'
Last week, Comey criticized Rosenstein's character, saying that it was not "strong. " The former FBI director was expanding on an op-ed he penned for the New York Times where he said President Donald Trump "eats your soul in small bites. "
"I think people like that, like Rod Rosenstein, who are people of accomplishment but not real sterling character, strong character, find themselves trapped," Comey said during a CNN town hall. "Then they start telling themselves a story to try justifying their being trapped which is 'yeah he's awful, but the country needs me. '"
Comey added that Rosenstein and other Republicans who don't stand up to Trump make compromises or stay silent because they believe they are needed in the long run to combat Trump.
More: James Comey called Trump a 'chronic liar. ' What his anti-Trump politics mean for the FBI
"They become trapped, they're not strong enough to push out of it, and they end up making comprises that they lose everything," Comey said.
When asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper whether he believes Rosenstein is of a strong character, Comey doubled down.
"Yeah, I don't think he is," the former FBI director said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr tapped Connecticut's chief federal prosecutor, John Durham, to assist in an investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation and the FBI's surveillance activities, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.
The person, who is not authorized to comment publicly, said that Durham has been assisting the attorney general for at least a couple of weeks to determine whether federal investigators acted appropriately in the early stages of the now-completed inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
Barr announced that he had launched the review last month during an appearance before a Senate subcommittee. He expressed concern about the FBI's use of surveillance involving associates of then-candidate Donald Trump as authorities sought to understand Russia's interference efforts, though Barr also said he did not know whether officials had done anything wrong.
"Spying on a campaign is a big deal," Barr told lawmakers then. "I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. "
At that time, the attorney general said he planned to examine the "genesis and the conduct" of the FBI's investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.
"I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred," Barr told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee. "I am concerned about it. There is a basis for my concern. "
Democrats have seized on Barr's use of the term "spying," asserting that the attorney general has sided with President Trump to disparage the 22-month investigation that the president has repeatedly described as a "witch-hunt. "
As recently as last week, however, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was unaware of any evidence indicating that the FBI had abused its surveillance authority, distancing himself from the attorney general. "That's not the term I would use," Wray told the same Senate committee, referring to the "spying" reference.
Rod Rosenstein, until recently the department's second-in-command, said in a speech Monday that based on what he knew in 2017, "the investigation of Russian election interference was justified, and closing it was not an option. "
The review involving the attorney general and Durham, a longtime Justice Department official, marks the third such inquiry into aspects of the Russia investigation that was led by special counsel Robert Mueller. It was first reported late Monday by the New York Times.
The department's inspector general is conducting a review of surveillance warrants authorities used to eavesdrop on a former campaign aide, Carter Page, in October 2016. Barr has said that effort should be completed by late May or perhaps June. The chief federal prosecutor in Utah, John Huber, also is in the midst of a separate review.
During his long career at the Justice Department, Durham has taken on a number of special investigations, including an appointment during the George W. Bush administration to investigate the CIA's destruction of videotapes depicting the torture of terror suspects.

'Trump economy' mostly a continuation of the Obama years

Texto completo: "We're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business you're not even going to believe it," President Trump told an American Farm Bureau Federation meeting in January. The attendees cheered.
Meanwhile, farmer income for the first three months of this year fell almost $12 billion. Farmers account for only 2% of all employed Americans, but the drop-off in their income was such that it suppressed the entire nation's personal income growth number for March.
I'm convinced that even as Trump recharges the trade war responsible for so much pain, his many fans in agricultural America would still whoop at his punch lines. If they didn't stop long ago as their misery mounted, why would they now?
You've got to hand it to Trump. His talent for seducing and entertaining his audiences is extraordinary. That takes genuine skill, and it's also a useful means to hide a less impressive reality. Trump campaigned as a genius dealmaker who would spread his magic formula for getting rich across the land.
Trump's supporters ignored evidence to the contrary. His six bankruptcies were public knowledge. Way back in 1987, as Trump's Atlantic City investments were crashing, The Philadelphia Inquirer ran a headline reading "Bankers Say Trump May Be Worth Less Than Zero." A new report in The New York Times documents a decade of carnage (1985 to 1994), when Trump lost over $1 billion.
In 1988, when he lost almost $47 million, he announced, "If the world goes to hell in a handbasket, I won't lose a dollar." In 1990, when he lost over $400 million, he said, "It's been good financially."
And his skilled spinning has hypnotized a usually sophisticated media into declaring this an era of amazing economic prosperity. Many of the indicators show strong growth for sure, but a look at the graphs of the decadelong expansion portrays the Trump years as mostly a continuation of the Obama years.
In terms of job creation, they're not as good. The much-heralded jobs number for April was indeed welcome. It brought the average number of jobs created during the 28-month Trump presidency to 202,000 a month. But in Obama's last 28 months, job growth averaged 220,000 a month. In 2014, he could have bragged of an average 251,000 a month but didn't.
To soundtrack to the news of 3.2% economic growth for the first quarter, Trump activated the nation's marching bands. Under Obama, however, the quarterly gross national product quietly surpassed 3% growth eight times. In four of the quarters, it rose 4% or better.
In not-so-good news, the deficit under Trump will jump from 3.5% of the economy in 2017 to 5.1% in 2019. Piling up debt in good times will make digging out of bad times harder.
Back in the heartland, farm income rose in December only because the government sent out checks to cover some losses caused by the trade war. To be fair to Trump, farmers were also hurt by low prices for their commodities. And some confrontation with China was needed to change its unfair trading practices.
Unfortunately, Trump has been taunting the Chinese. He accuses them of wanting to delay negotiations until a "very weak" Democrat is president. That's entertainment mode, not business mode.
Trade deficits are a much-misused measure of economic health. But since they are one of Trump's favorite yardsticks, do note that the U.S. trade deficit has reached its all-time high under him.
Humiliating the other side is not a clever negotiating tactic, assuming results are the goal. A businessperson would want to close the deal. An entertainer wants the show to go on.

Female executives offer some career advice to younger women: 'Leave the comfort zone'

Texto completo: .
With the 10th anniversary of my mother’s death approaching, this Mother’s Day was wistful. She would have turned 100 in weeks.
Mom grew up tough in southwest Arkansas. Pre-Great Depression, before penicillin, where railroads and river shipping reigned. She married my father during World War II, moved west and never looked back.
Honoring her memory, I asked top women at my firm what advice they would give women seeking to fulfill their vision of life.
Here's what my colleagues had to say about careers, investing and relationships.
Jill Hitchcock, a 20-year veteran, who heads our national Private Client Group, offers this advice:
Don't settle for comfortable
“Run toward the things that scare you, especially early in your career,” Hitchcock says.
“Too often, I see associates, especially women, seeking ‘comfortable’ roles instead of what really challenges them to build new skills," she said. "Don’t close doors opting for comfortable or known roles that play to skills you have; move toward roles that build skills you don’t have. ”
Carrianne Coffey, also 20 years at my firm, who runs our comparable overseas group, echoed this: “Feeling role-comfortable creates mediocrity and stagnation. Get a comfortable bed, some good sheets – then leave the comfort zone when you wake in the morning. ”
She adds, “Be direct about your aims. ” Her favorite advice comes courtesy of her older brother: “If you don’t ask for it, some other jerk will. ”
More: Being a mom is like having more than two full-time jobs and we aren't at all surprised
More: Need last-minute gifts Mom will actually like? We've got you.
Don't expect to have all the answers
Take time to breathe and reflect, says Laurine Garrity, our global marketing head.
“Don’t expect to have all the answers early in your career," she says. "I often see young adults seriously stressed thinking they need a long-term career road map. Life is unpredictable. You need to be flexible and resilient. So find out what you enjoy, what challenges you – then learn from those experiences and build on them. Over time, with work and self-reflection, you should land in a good place. ”
Lane Jarvis, our human capital czar, stressed avoiding burnout.
“Take care of your health. Don’t prioritize work over taking care of yourself. It will make you better and healthier so you can work longer. ”
On finances, listen to Jarvis: “Save some money. Pay yourself first. Do what you can afford, but put some money away. Always put money into your 401(k). ”
Always fund your 401(k)
Garrity agrees. “Invest in yourself. Participate as much as you can in your 401(k). Get invested in the market and stick with a basic plan — don’t get too cute with it. ”
Coffey also stressed simplicity. “For longer-term savings, save all you can in any amount you can and invest in stocks. Look up in 20 or 30 years from now, and you will be glad you did. ”
Then, some frank talk about the trade-offs accompanying marriage and kids.
If you're going to marry, Garrity says, “Marry someone who supports you – personally and professionally. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my husband. I don’t like the phrase ‘you can have it all’ – it sets false expectations. You can have a successful career and family. But it takes hard work, compromise, direct communication and the realization it will never be perfect. ”
Create a support network
Realistic expectations rang Hitchcock's bell, too. “If you’re to stay home to raise kids, understand you’re taking on major personal risk if something happens to the primary breadwinner in your family. Make sure you have enough disability and life insurance to support you and your kids if the unexpected happens. It happens. ”
And make sure you have a support network, says Jarvis. “This group can help you navigate through opportunities and setbacks. ”
Finally, they agreed, your path is up to you and no one else – to go your own way – maybe a bit like my mom did, just different.

Nothing compares to the magic of joy

Texto completo: On Monday I was honored to speak to the graduating students at Arizona State University. It was an intimidating occasion. ASU is the most innovative university in the world. Plus, there were 35,000 people in the football stadium.
Anybody speaking to college students these days is aware of how hard it is to be a young adult today, with rising rates of depression, other mental health issues, even suicide.
So while these talks are usually occasions to talk about professional life, my goal was to get them thinking about the future of their emotional lives, which is really going to be at the center of everything.
There are two kinds of emotion present at any graduation ceremony. For the graduating students there is happiness. They've achieved something. They've worked hard and are moving closer to their goals.
There is a different emotion up in the stands among the families and friends. That emotion is joy. They are not thinking about themselves. Their delight is seeing the glow on the graduate's face, the laughter in her voice, the progress of his journey, the blooming of a whole person.
Happiness usually involves a victory for the self. Joy tends to involve the transcendence of self. Happiness comes from accomplishments. Joy comes when your heart is in another. Joy comes after years of changing diapers, driving to practice, worrying at night, dancing in the kitchen, playing in the yard and just sitting quietly together watching TV. Joy is the present that life gives you as you give away your gifts.
The core point is that happiness is good, but joy is better. It's smart to enjoy happiness, but it's smarter still to put yourself in situations where you might experience joy.
People receive joy after they have over-invested in their friendships. The thing the wisest people say about friendship is this: Lovers stand face to face staring into each other's eyes. But friends stand side by side, staring at the things they both care about. Friendship is about doing things together. So people build their friendships by organizing activities that are repeated weekly, monthly or annually: picnics, fantasy leagues, book clubs, etc.
A friend of mine organized a giving circle when he graduated. He and his friends put money into a common pot every year, and every year they gather to decide what cause they will give the money to. The philanthropy is nice, but it's really just a pretext to get them together each year, so they can live life shoulder to shoulder.
They say that love is blind, but the affection friends have for each other is the opposite of blind. It is ferociously attentive. You are vulnerable, and your friend holds your vulnerability. He pauses, and you wait for him. You err, and she forgives.
"You will be loved," Italian novelist Cesare Pavese wrote, "the day when you will be able to show your weakness without the other person using it to assert his strength."
Transparency is the fuel of friendship. We live in an age of social media. It's very easy to create false personas and live life as a performance.
We live in a cruel time, when people attack you when they see a hint of vulnerability. So, it's extra important to stick with emotional honesty even after people take advantage of your vulnerability to inflict pain. Vulnerability is the only means we have to build relationships, and relationships are the only means we have to experience joy.
My friend Catherine Bly Cox observed that when her first daughter was born, she realized she loved her more than evolution required. I love that phrase because it speaks to what is distinctly human, our complex and infinite caring for one another.
There are some things we do because biology demands it. There are some things we do to pay the rent. But material drives don't explain the magic of our friendships and the way our soul sings when we watch loved ones glow.
Sometimes when you're out with your friends, you taste a kind of effervescent joy. Several years ago, writer Zadie Smith was dancing at a club with her friends when a song from A Tribe Called Quest came on. At that point, she wrote, "A rail-thin man with enormous eyes reached across a sea of bodies for my hand. He kept asking me the same thing over and over: You feeling it? I was. My ridiculous heels were killing me, I was terrified I might die, yet I felt simultaneously overwhelmed with delight that Can I Kick It?' should happen to be playing at this precise moment in the history of the world, and was now morphing into Smells Like Teen Spirit.' I took the man's hand. The top of my head flew away. We danced and danced. We gave ourselves up to joy."
When you have moments like that, you realize there is magic in the world. You can't create the magic intentionally, but when you are living at that deep affectionate level, it sometimes just combusts within you. A blaze of joy.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is fond of using unflattering comparisons and backhanded nicknames to describe his political rivals. Jeb Bush was "low-energy," Marco Rubio became "Little Marco," Joe Biden was called "Sleepy Joe," and so on.
On Friday, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigeig became "Alfred E. Neuman. "
In an interview with Politico, Trump said “Alfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States," referring to Buttigieg. Alfred E. Neuman is the longtime wispy haired boy mascot of MAD magazine.
When asked, Buttigieg told Politico, "I’ll be honest. I had to Google that," he said. "I guess it’s just a generational thing. I didn’t get the reference. "
"But he’s also the president of the United States," Buttigieg continued, before referencing the ongoing U. S. -China trade talks. "I’m surprised he’s not spending more time trying to salvage this China deal. "
Trade talks collapse: U. S. , China break off latest trade talks without a deal, as new tariffs rile markets
How the trade war with China could affect you: Higher prices, lost jobs and falling stocks
To some, the comment seemed dated.
New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman noted that such a reference "might have worked better twenty years ago. "
The magazine hit back, asking on Twitter: "Who’s Pete Buttigieg? Must be a generational thing. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Within a day of the release of the Mueller report last month, President Trump sought to have former White House counsel Don McGahn declare he didn't consider the president's 2017 directive that he seek Robert Mueller's dismissal to be obstruction of justice, but Mr. McGahn rebuffed the request, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Trump has publicly denied asking Mr. McGahn to fire the Russia probe special counsel since the release of the report. Mr. Mueller's report detailed that directive, and a subsequent request by Mr. Trump that Mr. McGahn deny that conversation ever happened, and said that Mr. McGahn rebuffed both. Last month, Mr. Trump tweeted: "If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didn't need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself."
Privately, Mr. Trump asked White House special counsel Emmet Flood to inquire whether Mr. McGahn would release a statement asserting that he didn't believe those interactions with the president -- and Mr. Trump's subsequent efforts to have Mr. McGahn deny news reports about that request -- amounted to obstruction, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Flood didn't respond to a request for comment.
William Burck, a lawyer for Mr. McGahn, said in a statement about the request: "We did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister. It was a request, professionally and cordially made."
Mr. McGahn turned down the request because he didn't want to weigh in on the totality of evidence in the report beyond his own testimony, and didn't want to comment on his own testimony in isolation, the people said. Mr. McGahn also didn't view his personal opinion as relevant, because Attorney General William Barr had already said he didn't believe the evidence in Mr. Mueller's report amounted to obstruction of justice, the people said.
Mr. Flood, as he sought the statement from Mr. McGahn, pointed to previous assertions by Mr. Burck that if Mr. McGahn believed Mr. Trump had committed a crime, he would have resigned, the people said.
Last August, following reports that Mr. McGahn had spent 30 hours talking to Mr. Mueller's investigators, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow reached out to Mr. Burck to inquire about the scope of Mr. McGahn's testimony to Mr. Mueller, according to people familiar with the conversation. John Dowd, who headed the president's legal team, had also contacted Mr. Burck previously to inquire about Mr. McGahn's testimony and whether he had told Mr. Mueller that Mr. Trump committed any crimes, the people said.
Mr. McGahn told investigators that he prepared to resign in June 2017 rather than follow Mr. Trump's directive to call the deputy attorney general and ask him to dismiss Mr. Mueller, but stayed when Mr. Trump didn't press him on the matter. Mr. McGahn left his White House position in October 2018.
Mr. Trump's effort to have Mr. McGahn make a public statement after the report's release could intensify efforts by Democratic lawmakers to compel him to testify about his interactions with Mr. Trump. The White House on Tuesday directed Mr. McGahn to rebuff a subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee for documents related to Mr. Mueller's investigation, saying the requested documents implicated executive privilege.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), in a letter to Mr. Burck on Tuesday evening, said he expected the committee would vote to hold Mr. McGahn in contempt if he didn't appear before the panel on May 21.
Mr. Trump and his allies have criticized Mr. McGahn since the report's release. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani called Mr. McGahn "hopelessly confused" in a CNN interview. Mr. Burck has defended the episodes in the report involving his client as "accurately described" and called Mr. Giuliani's comments a "mystery."
A statement from Mr. McGahn declaring that he didn't believe Mr. Trump committed a crime could have bolstered the White House's broader public argument for Mr. Trump's innocence, particularly as Congress continues to investigate Mr. Trump for obstruction and other matters related to the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and Moscow's ties to the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump has publicly declared the Mueller report exonerates him and has denied obstructing justice.
Mr. Mueller in his report said he wasn't exonerating Mr. Trump and wrote: "The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred." He said he decided not to make a decision on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice in part because of a policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted.
According to the Mueller report, Mr. Trump called Mr. McGahn at home in June 2017 -- a month after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had appointed Mr. Mueller -- and directed him to call Mr. Rosenstein and say Mr. Mueller had conflicts that precluded him from serving as special counsel. "You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod," the president said.
Mr. McGahn was "perturbed" by Mr. Trump's order, according to the report, and prepared to resign rather than carry it out, telling then-chief of staff Reince Priebus the president had asked Mr. McGahn to "do crazy shit." He told Mr. Mueller's investigators that he and other White House aides saw the alleged conflicts -- which included Mr. Mueller's effort to obtain a refund from one of Mr. Trump's golf clubs in 2011 -- as "silly" and "not real," and that they had said as much to Mr. Trump, according to the report.
After the New York Times reported in January 2018 that Mr. Trump had directed Mr. McGahn to have the special counsel dismissed, Mr. Trump publicly denied it and sought to have aides ask Mr. McGahn to dispute the reports, at one point threatening to fire Mr. McGahn, according to the Mueller report. The next month, he met face-to-face with Mr. McGahn and asked him: "Did I say the word fire?" Mr. McGahn told Mr. Trump that he understood the conversation as "Mueller has to go."

Trump's pardon sends a disturbing message

Texto completo: ON MAY 16, 2008, former Army Lieutenant Michael Behenna drove Ali Mansur to a railroad culvert in the middle of the Iraqi desert.
Behenna suspected that Mansur had played a role in an IED explosion that killed two of his fellow soldiers. He blindfolded him, stripped him naked, pointed a Glock pistol at his head, and told him that he would die that day if he didn't tell him who was responsible for the attack. He then shot Mansur in the head and chest, leaving his bloodied body in the culvert to be picked up by Iraqi police the next day.
Behenna would be convicted of murdering Mansur and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was released from jail in 2014 on parole.
This week, Donald Trump issued a formal pardon to Behenna. In doing so, Trump has made a mockery of military justice and the military's oft-stated commitment to human rights and the rule of law.
Behenna has long claimed that he'd acted in self-defense after Mansur threw a rock at him and lunged for his gun. After his conviction Behenna appealed the case, but a narrowly decided US Court of Appeals ruling determined that even if Behenna's story of self-defense was true, by engaging in an unlawful interrogation and threatening the victim, he had “brought about the situation that resulted in the necessity to kill another."
In effect, by his actions, Behenna had surrendered any claim to self-defense.
Behenna was not exactly remorseful for his crimes. According to court documents, he allegedly told other soldiers that “he would do it again, and he did not feel bad about it because he just lost two guys."
Since Behenna left prison, powerful allies have launched a campaign to clear his name.
Republicans in Oklahoma, including the former governor, Mary Fallin, and both US Senators, James Inhofe and James Lanfkord, as well as a host of retired military officials have called on Trump to pardon Behenna.
Just last month, Oklahoma's attorney general, Mike Hunter, wrote to the president and argued that “Mr. Behenna served his country with distinction, honor, and sacrifice," and had “admitted to his mistakes, has learned from them, and deserves to move on from this incident without living under its cloud for the rest of his life." In a White House statement announcing the pardon, press secretary Sarah Sanders cited this support for Behenna and even referenced the fact that “upon his release, dozens of Patriot Guard motorcycle riders met Mr. Behenna to escort him back to his home in Oklahoma."
Of course many, if not the vast majority, of US soldiers serve with distinction and honor and don't strip prisoners naked, threaten their lives, and shoot them dead in a barren desert.
For a president who has regularly shown disdain for human rights and the rule of law, there is little about the Behenna pardon that is surprising. During the 2016 campaign, Trump regularly extolled the virtues of torture and waterboarding and complained about the “very politically correct war" the Obama administration had been waging against the Islamic State. Most infamously, he even suggested killing the family members of suspected terrorists.
As president, he has offered public support for Major Matt Golsteyn, who is facing murder charges in the death of a suspected Afghan bombmaker, and Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused of killing Iraqi civilians in 2017.
The Gallagher case is particularly relevant because, as the New York Times reported last month, his fellow SEALs made formal complaints about potential war crimes by Gallagher only to be told by superior officers that speaking out could put their careers at risk. In March, rather than praise those who courageously came forward, Trump tweeted approvingly about Gallagher, saying that in “honor of his past service to our Country . . . he would soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court."
It's been hard enough to get the military to police its own — and even harder to empower soldiers to bring to light abuses by their comrades in arms. It's doubly difficult to convince those around the world that the American military will hold those who violate the law accountable for their actions. Trump has fundamentally set back these efforts.
The message being sent by the commander-in-chief of the military is that he has little problem with soldiers committing heinous and illegal offenses. Rather than serving as a moral voice against war crimes, Trump is endorsing them. Even more ominous is the message sent to those who might be inclined to take justice into their own hands on a battlefield: the president has your back.
To those who serve honorably and adhere to the laws of armed combat, and to those Americans who expect their military to demonstrate professionalism and embrace the rhetorical ideals so often spouted by politicians, Trump's pardon of Behenna is a slap in the face — and a reminder that a lawless and morally challenged president is commanding the most powerful military in the world.

Texto completo: Nina Simone was a singer-songwriter, pianist and civil rights activist whose career has sparked renewed interest in recent years. Her song "Four Women" is the inspiration for a play with music that closes the 2018-19 Black Rep season.
Playwright Christina Ham's "Nina Simone: Four Women" imagines Simone at the site of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., where four African-American girls were killed in a Ku Klux Klan bombing on Sept. 15, 1963.
In the play, Simone interacts with three other black women depicted in the song, whose skin colors represent a range of shades: Aunt Sarah, whose skin is very dark; yellow-skinned Sephronia; and tan-skinned Sweet Thing. Simone herself stands in for the song's fourth woman, the brown-skinned Peaches.
Although "Nina Simone: Four Women" features some of Simone's socially conscious songs -- including "To Be Young, Gifted and Black" and the protest number, "Mississippi Goddam" -- Ham said the play is not meant to be just a jukebox musical.
"I was really trying to create a narrative about her work that didn't exist, that dealt with the issues in the song, 'Four Women,'" Ham says. "It was important to me to capture a moment in time, in which Nina Simone switched from being an artist to an artist and activist."
Black Rep founder and producing director Ron Himes, director of the show and longtime fan of Simone, says he has been working for years to put together the right cast, which includes singer Denise Thimes as Aunt Sarah. Simone will be played by Leah Stewart.
"One of the big things that Christina (Ham) deals with is colorism," Himes says. "Issues of skin tone and color that we deal with as a race, but that people outside the race don't always see or understand. To find four women who could fit those roles, but who could also act and sing those roles, was a challenge."
Thimes says she was introduced to Simone's music "probably at the age of 11. So I was quite familiar with the song 'Four Women,' and it's always been one of my favorites."
Simone was the subject of the 2015 documentary "What Happened, Miss Simone?," which the New York Times called "bracingly urgent." And Zoe Saldana ("Guardians of the Galaxy") controversially appeared with darkened skin to portray Simone in the biopic "Nina" (2016).
"Nina Simone: Four Women" continues to maintain a spotlight on an artist who deserves wider recognition.
"Her music is still saying things that are relevant to what we're facing right now," Ham says. "She's being rediscovered in a way that I think is exciting and in a way that she probably hadn't experienced when she was alive."

Champions League Plan Excludes Most of Europe

Texto completo: It was the rarest of feats in modern European soccer: Ajax Amsterdam, a proud club from the Dutch league, battling its way past giants like Real Madrid and Juventus to the cusp of a place in the Champions League final.
Ajax's journey, which began in the summer qualifying rounds and was ended by an injury-time goal in the semifinals on Wednesday, was the kind of puncher's chance that every small club dreams of in the Champions League. But it is unlikely to be repeated if concrete proposals for the future of European soccer drawn up by the continent's governing body and its richest clubs come to fruition.
While officials from the continent's biggest clubs and UEFA, which governs the sport in Europe and organizes the Champions League, have suggested that there is a suite of options on the table, documents obtained by The New York Times outline only one developed plan. If approved, it would calcify the Champions League into a competition dominated by a small group of elite clubs and leave as few as four of its 32 places available for teams from leagues in Europe's 55 national federations.
Discussions over the proposed changes have proved divisive, pitting national leagues -- led by England's Premier League, La Liga in Spain and competitions in Germany and France -- against some of their own members. But the documents reviewed by The Times, the product of a project that appears to have been in the works for more than a year, present a more formidable threat to domestic leagues and most clubs than previously known.
If approved, they would result in a Champions League that could render national competitions nearly irrelevant, impose significant barriers to entry for teams outside the game's current elite and deepen the divide between the two dozen richest clubs and the hundreds of others that make up the bulk of the European game.
Officials from the domestic leagues were shown the proposal for restructured European competitions this week. The new tournaments would, starting in 2024, allow the top 24 teams in a 32-team Champions League to qualify automatically for the next season's event, effectively guaranteeing them annual participation and tens of millions of dollars more in broadcasting revenue than their domestic rivals would receive. Those rivals would most likely be unable to match the rich clubs' spending power and would find it prohibitively difficult to play their way into the Champions League on the field.
The biggest clubs, notably those from Spain and Italy, are pushing the proposals the hardest, according to people familiar with the discussions. They argue that the changes are needed to provide more fiscal certainty year after year.
UEFA has been in talks about proposals for months with the European Club Association, a group that is led by Juventus's chairman, Andrea Agnelli, and is driving the campaign for an elite competition. UEFA belatedly met with representatives of Europe's leagues on Wednesday. After the meeting, Aleksander Ceferin, the UEFA president, said, "At the moment we have only ideas and opinions."
Some leaders of European leagues who were present did not accept that description, pointing out that only one proposal had been presented -- a formal one with charts and graphics that was created without input from the leagues. The Spanish league president Javier Tebas, a vocal critic of the plans, said after the meeting that the plans were so developed that there appeared to be little room for negotiation.
"We cannot accept that these are just plans and proposals for an open discussion with stakeholders about the future of professional football," Tebas told The Times. "In reality, we were presented with a concrete project developed by UEFA in full cooperation with a small group of rich and powerful European clubs to reform European club competitions after 2024 in a format that could destroy domestic competitions and the sporting and financial sustainability of the vast majority of clubs in Europe.
"We are open for a constructive dialogue to reform European football together with other stakeholders, but if this is the project on the table, then the margins for negotiations are very limited."
While the Champions League's main competition will continue to be the 32-team event it is today, UEFA envisages substantial changes to its format to ensure a longer group stage in which teams would play in four groups of eight, with the top four teams qualifying for the knockout stages. Such a setup would create dozens more matchups of elite clubs to sell to broadcasters, with some perhaps on weekend dates that are traditionally reserved for domestic league play.
Champions from lower-profile leagues like those in the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and most of Eastern Europe, as well as elite-league clubs outside the top four or five spots in their domestic competitions, would be relegated to a 32-team second-tier competition and to a third division with 64 teams. Teams would be eligible to be promoted and relegated among the three divisions, but the financial resources available to those at the top could create a competitive advantage that might secure their places in the Champions League for the foreseeable future. Only four of the 32 places would be reserved for incoming clubs each season.
Leaders of Europe's domestic leagues fear the changes could reduce their competitions to fourth-tier afterthoughts behind the three European competitions, while small and medium-size clubs have expressed concern that their fans would no longer have the chance to dream of even competing against the continent's biggest clubs for Europe's biggest prizes.
"The objective of football is to give happiness to fans, and to give happiness is to have a chance of winning," said Bernard Caiazzo, the owner of the French team St.-Étienne.
The uncertainty has already prevented some teams from securing outside investment, according to Caiazzo. His club, once a power in European competition, had been in talks with minority investors who have now cooled on buying a minority stake, he said.
St.-Étienne has a storied past, having won 10 French championships during a heyday that ended with its last league title in 1981. In recent years, it has found itself among the also-rans in France's Ligue 1, as first Lyon and now Paris St.-Germain -- a club whose rise has been financed by seemingly endless infusions of cash from its Qatari owners -- have dominated French soccer.
He said he worried that the proposed Champions League overhaul would leave new owners with no reason to invest.
"Of course, these investors, new investors, will consider if we close the system that of course they could suddenly be outside," Caiazzo said.

Comey: 'No doubt' Trump would be charged with obstruction if not president

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Former FBI Director James Comey said Thursday that Donald Trump would have been charged with obstruction of justice if he was not a sitting president, based on the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe report.
The comment came during a roughly one-hour long town hall broadcast on CNN, where Comey touched on a number of issues, including whether he will run for office and his thoughts on how best to respond to school shootings.
Moderator Anderson Cooper asked Comey if he agreed with an open letter signed by hundreds of former federal prosecutors declaring that Trump would have been charged with obstruction if he wasn't currently the president.
"I agree," Comey said before affirming his view with "no doubt" when questioned again by Cooper. Comey pointed out that Muller laid out 10 different episodes in his report that would have supported an obstruction charge.
Who is James Comey?: A hero who helped expose President Trump’s behavior, or a villain whose politics damage the FBI?
Former federal prosecutors: If Trump wasn't president, he would be guilty of obstruction
Comey added that the episodes he thought were most likely to be the basis of an obstruction charge against Trump weren't the ones involving him but others detailed in the report. He pointed to former White House counsel Don McGahn being asked by Trump to fire Mueller, which McGahn refused to do.
"The president is not above the law and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice in connection with executive branch activities," Comey said. "That's just crazy and a recipe for lawlessness. "
Comey said the question is whether Trump acted with the corrupt intent required to support an obstruction charge. Comey said "it sure looks like" Trump had the necessary criminal intent to charge him with obstruction of justice.
Here are some more top moments from Comey's town hall:
'The FBI doesn't spy . . . . The FBI investigates'
Comey pushed back against Attorney General William Barr's statement that there was "spying" by the FBI of Trump's 2016 campaign.
"The only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it, which is really disappointing," Comey said of Barr's word choice.
Barr last month told senators, without providing evidence, that Trump's 2016 campaign was spied on. Comey, however, said that Barr "knows better than that," adding that the FBI cannot conduct electronic surveillance without getting a warrant from a federal judge.
Comey also said that the FBI did not spy when asked about a recent report by the New York Times that details how an undercover U. S. intelligence official tried to probe George Papadopoulos on possible ties between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. At the time, Papadopoulos was a junior foreign policy aide to the campaign.
'The FBI doesn't spy': Comey slams Barr for spying claim, 'misleading' Mueller summary
Sessions sides with Barr: 'Spying' proper term for FBI surveillance of Trump's 2016 campaign
"I'm not going to comment on a particular investigative step, because that's for the bureau to do and I'm not in the government any longer," he also told the audience. "But the FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates. "
The former FBI director said that the reported encounter happened during a time when the U. S. was alerted that "the Russians were engaged in a massive effort to attack our democracy" and there had been talks before that point between a Russian representative and an adviser on Trump's campaign about "dirt" Russians had on Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.
"We all should have been fired if when we learned that, we didn't investigate to figure out is there a connection between any Americans and this Russian effort," he said.
In addition, Comey said that the FBI took the proper steps to investigate that tip.
"We acted in a responsible, limited and constrained way," he said. "I'm proud of the way we conducted ourselves. "
Russia's 2020 goals
Comey said in 2016 Russia had three goals: Destabilize United States' democracy, hurt Hillary Clinton, and help Donald Trump.
For 2020, Comey said he believes Russia will continue to pursue its primary goal.
"Going into 2020, their goals, my common sense tells me will be, to continue their overarching goal, which is to damage the United States of America," Comey said.
He added that he believes Russia will also work to support Trump and help the president get re-elected "because surely they think they'll do better with someone who jokes on the phone with Vladimir Putin that the Russia thing is a hoax than they will with whoever else might be president. "
Comey also left open the possibility that Russia has some kind of leverage over Trump. When first asked by Cooper, Comey said: "I don't know the answer to that. "
When asked whether it's possible the Kremlin has leverage over the president, Comey said: "Yes. "
The moral case against Trump
The former FBI director repeatedly spoke out against Trump during the town hall, highlighting what he called Trump's penchant for lying and his amorality.
"You cannot have a president who is a chronic liar," he said, later adding that Trump is an "amoral leader. "
"The president of the United States cannot be someone who lies constantly," Comey also said Thursday night.
In addition, Comey stood by an op-ed he wrote in the New York Times where he claimed that Trump "eats your soul in small bites. "
He maintained that he believes Barr has "lost most of his reputation with the way he's conducted himself" since Mueller submitted his report to the attorney general.
Barr summarized Mueller's 448-page report in a 4-page memo to Congress. He later released a redacted version of the report, but Democratic lawmakers are urging the Justice Department to release an unredacted version and the report's underlying evidence.
"I think he acted in a way that's less than honorable in the way he described it in writing and the way he described during a press conference, and continues to talk as if he's the president's lawyer," Comey said. "That is not the attorney general's job. "
Despite the president's conduct, Comey said he doesn't believe Trump should be impeached. Instead, he said he believed it would be better if voters across the political spectrum came together to deny Trump a second term out of a shared sense of fundamental values.
"I kind of hope there isn't an impeachment because I think it will leave us in a situation where we're kind of off the hook," Comey said. "We need an election where the American people stand up and say . . . we have something in common that's not negotiable. Our president must reflect the values of this country. "
Will he run for office?
Comey had one simple answer when asked whether voters would ever see his name on a ballot: "No, never. "
While he said seeking elected office is not in his future, he also said he admires "good people" who do run. On April Fools Day, Comey joked that he was jumping into the already crowded Democratic presidential field. He later noted that it was just a prank.
"I admire good people who run for office, we need good people on both sides of the aisle running for office," he said. "It's not my thing, but there are lots of ways to contribute, to serve your community and your country without running for office. "
Say 'no' to arming teachers
Comey weighed in on the school shootings debate.
Just this week, one student was killed and seven others injured after a shooting at a K-12 STEM school in Colorado.
Speaking from his FBI experience, Comey said that there needs to be a better job connecting educators, law enforcement and the mental health community. He said there needs to be a process to identify "troubled souls" earlier and to then get them the help they need.

He also pushed back on a suggestion from President Trump to arm teachers to protect their students from school shooters. The president proposed the controversial move in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla.
"The answer in my experience, as someone that's been around firearms most of my life, is not to arm teachers," Comey said.
Two years after firing by Trump, it's still 'numbing'
The town hall took place two years to the day after Comey was abruptly fired by the president when he was not in Washington, but across the country in California.
Comey said he was speaking with custodial staff at the FBI bureau in Los Angeles, when he looked up and saw CNN reporting that he had resigned. Then the cable network said he had been fired.
"I was numb because I didn't expect to be fired," he told Cooper.
After shaking all of the staff's hands that day, Comey said he walked across the room and the first call he took was from his wife.
"'Have you been fired? The kids say it's all over the internet,'" Comey said he remembered his wife saying.
Comey said he later found out that someone was at his office on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington with a letter from the president while he was on the other side of the country learning on TV that he'd been let go. Despite his icy relationship with Trump, Comey said he never anticipated that he would be axed.
"It still feels a little bit numbing, frankly, and like it happened yesterday and a lifetime ago," he said.

Don't let Trump hide brutal LGBTQ record behind 'religious freedom' rhetoric in 2020 race

Texto completo: Last week President Donald Trump took another hostile action against LGBTQ people.
But you wouldn’t know that from many of the headlines.
“Trump Administration Strengthens ‘Conscience Rule’ for Health Care Workers,” read the headline in the New York Times about a bill that would allow doctors, nurses, physicians, pharmacists, nurses, teachers and others to discriminate based on their religious beliefs. National Public Radio’s web site went with “New Trump Rule Protects Health Care Workers Who Refuse Care For Religious Reasons. ”
It’s true that someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity are only two among several reasons such workers, under an expanded Department of Health and Human Services rule, may deny care to people based on religious grounds. And most reports did discuss the threat to LGBTQ people, in addition to the threat to other groups, such as women seeking reproductive health care.
But the coded language used by the Trump administration, couched in protecting religious beliefs rather than permitting discrimination against LGBTQ people and other groups, is being allowed to frame the discussion. Using this coded language to attack LGBTQ rights has benefited this administration as it continues to galvanize conservative evangelicals — who know exactly who is being targeted — while not alienating people who might see these efforts as an attack on civil rights.
Read more commentary:
We can protect LGBTQ people and religious freedom. Pete Buttigieg and Utah show the way.
American churches must reject literalism and admit we got it wrong on gay people
America is at a gay rights crossroads, thanks to Pete Buttigieg and the Supreme Court
But make no mistake: LGBTQ people are among the primary targets if not the main target of such efforts. It's part of religious conservatives' strategy to chip away at marriage equality and LGBTQ rights much as they have done on the issue of abortion rights for many years.
Back in 2014, I interviewed Frank Schubert, the mastermind strategist behind California’s Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in that state, and who went on to work with the anti-gay National Organization for Marriage as it unsuccessfully fought marriage equality all the way up to the U. S. Supreme Court.
Schubert, sitting on a panel with other anti-LGBTQ religious leaders at the annual Values Voter Summit as they mapped out strategy to fight LGBTQ rights, had just explained that the battle against marriage equality would mirror the battle against legal abortion if his side lost at the high court. The following year his side did in fact lose, when the court handed down the historic Obergefell ruling.
LGBTQ discrimination recast as 'freedom'
“In a broad sense, it will be similar to the pro-life movement after Roe v. Wade,” Schubert told me, claiming that “religious liberty issues will be very much in the crosshairs” if marriage equality prevailed. “An example would be protecting the right of a believer in traditional marriage from being punished by the government. Conscience protections — those sorts of things,” Schubert said.
The effort to recast discrimination against LGBTQ people, and roll back rights that were hard won, has indeed been successful. The debate has shifted to issues such as “religious liberty” and “conscience. ”
This has even enabled some cynical politicians to argue that they support the rights of LGBTQ people — such as when Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention in 2016 that he will “protect our LGBTQ citizens” — while simultaneously making promises to anti-LGBTQ evangelical leaders to push policies that will ultimately unravel LGBTQ rights.
Coded anti-LGBTQ language must be exposed
That’s why it’s important that the agenda of anti-LGBTQ forces, including the coded language they use, be fully exposed. Some of the Trump administration’s hostile actions, such as the president’s Twitter announcement in 2017 that’d be banning transgender people from the military, are so overt they can’t be papered over. But others are disguised as protecting religious freedom.
At February’s annual National Prayer Breakfast, Trump defended a state-funded Michigan adoption agency’s efforts to ban gay and lesbian couples from adopting children, for example. “We will always protect our country’s long and proud tradition of faith-based adoption,” Trump said, without uttering the words “gay” or “lesbian. ”
When Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in March, he claimed that “freedom of religion is under attack in our country. ” He then portrayed himself and his family as among the victims.
“My own family recently came under attack just because my wife Karen went back to teach art to children at a Christian school,” Pence said. He didn't mention that the Virginia private school in question bans LGBTQ students and employees and labels being LGBTQ as “moral misconduct. ” The school’s employment application equates homosexuality and transgender identity with polygamy, extramarital sex, pornography and “sexual immorality. ”
Brutal hostility is Trump's real record
In Virginia and more than half the states, absent a federal law such as the Equality Act recently re-introduced in Congress, there are no protections for LGBT people against such discrimination in employment and education. And yet, in polls Americans express broad support for these protections. Most Americans don’t see this as an issue of “religious liberty” — and many of them are people of faith themselves — but rather as one of flat out discrimination.
It’s for that reason that Trump, Pence and others in the GOP speak in inexplicit ways to play to the evangelical base, while keeping the anti-LGBTQ agenda below the radar for anyone who would be turned off by blatant bigotry. But when you're the target, you get it. Many of us in the LGBTQ community understand their code and why their intent must be made clear.
Trump's brutal record of hostility to LGBTQ people, and his bowing to those determined to roll back LGBTQ rights, must be fully laid bare to voters before the 2020 election. As long as the administration is allowed to get away with vague statements and code language, it won't be.

NY moves closer to allowing release of Trump's taxes

Texto completo: ALBANY – The state Senate on Wednesday passed legislation that would allow the state Tax Department to release a president's state tax returns if any of three congressional committees asks for them.
Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, introduced the measure last month in a bid to aid Democrats who control the U.S. House in their efforts to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns. It passed along party lines, 39-21.
Because Trump is a New Yorker, the state Legislature "has a special role and responsibility to assist Congress in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities," Hoylman said Tuesday after the bill passed a Senate committee.
He added Wednesday, "Simply put, no one is above the law, and we have a situation in Washington where a co-equal branch of government has requested tax information from the White House and it is being stonewalled."
The Democrat-controlled Senate passed another bill Wednesday aimed at Trump.
It would allow New York to prosecute Trump associates even if they are pardoned by the president on the federal level.
What happens next? With the Senate approval, the bills now go to the Democrat-led Assembly, where leaders haven't indicated whether it would pass them.
Then they would need the signature of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who, despite being a harsh Trump critic, has indicated he would back the proposal to let the state release Trump's taxes to Congress if it would apply to more than just the president.
The Trump administration has rejected requests by House Democrats to get Trump's federal tax returns.
Since Trump files his taxes in New York, the bill would allow three congressional committees — the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation — to request the state Department of Taxation and Finance to provide the president's state tax returns.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler praised New York's bill, saying it would aid his investigation into the White House.
"This bill is a workaround to a White House that continues to obstruct and stonewall the legitimate oversight work of Congress," he said in a statement.
Republicans ripped both the tax bill and the so-called "double jeopardy" bill, saying they are politically motivated and set dangerous precedents.
"I truly believe that this is pure and simple a political maneuver to attack a sitting president of the United States to score political points in your individual districts," Sen. Thomas O'Mara, R-Big Flats, Chemung County, said on the Senate floor.
The "double jeopardy" bill would let state prosecutors bring charges — even if a presidential pardon was issued. Attorney General Letitia James, a Trump critic, has pushed for the measure.
The bill appears to have the support of Cuomo and the Assembly.
Changing the law Under New York law, sharing state tax return information is prohibited, except under rare circumstances. The bill would create an exemption when the returns are sought by congressional committees in any investigations.
Democrats dismissed Republicans' concerns that it would open all New Yorkers to tax scrutiny by Congress, saying the measure is limited in scope and the IRS already has access to state tax returns.
The bill is one of three Hoylman has introduced to get at Trump's taxes.
One would require all statewide elected officials, including the president and vice president if they file New York income taxes, to release their taxes publicly each year.
Another would keep Trump off the state's 2020 ballot if he doesn't release his taxes.
Hoylman said the Senate focused on the tax bill passed Wednesday because it appears to be more urgent, since Trump is fighting with the House over release of his taxes to the congressional committees.
Scrutinizing Trump's taxes The bill's passage in the Senate came a day after The New York Times reported on details of Trump's tax returns from 1985 through 1994, saying he lost more than $1 billion through his business dealings over that span.
On Wednesday, Trump blasted the report, saying the tax filings demonstrated "write-offs" and "depreciation."
"Real estate developers in the 1980's & 1990's, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases," Trump tweeted early Wednesday.

Texto completo: This column is part of a series for the Design special report of The New York Times. Readers are invited to send questions to designadvice@nytimes.com.
I would like to install central air-conditioning in my prewar apartment, but I want something minimally invasive. What are my options, and how do I get started?
First, ask your management if anyone else has added air-conditioning to their units. If yes, follow whatever course that neighbor employed.
If you are an air-con maverick, find out whether the building has enough available power to allow you to upgrade your electrical service for the new system.
Are you able to use through-the-wall units like those offered by LG? If your building is a landmark, this will not be an option, at least not on street-facing windows. At that point, you will want to consider what is known as a split system.
The split system will require outdoor space for a condenser unit, either in a yard or on the roof. Ask if you have access to such a space. No? Think about buying a few more fans.
If you do clear the bar, then you'll ideally meet two or three air-conditioning contractors for competitive bids to help figure out power and size requirements as well as the estimated cost.
For the through-the-wall option, each unit installed will require a new masonry opening in an exterior wall. If you go this route, make sure you have a general contractor. The masonry openings might require an engineer, and permits will have to be filed.
A split system like those offered by Mitsubishi involves one or more fan coil units inside your apartment and the aforementioned condenser unit outdoors. Fan coil units are generally rectangular plastic boxes that are installed high on a wall and are visually unobtrusive. But because the wall units will need to be hooked up to your waste line to drain any condensation, you will also need your general contractor to file permits for electrical and plumbing and tackle the mess after the job is done. Installing power and plumbing pipes and possibly plywood backing for the wall units will involve cutting your walls open. Once the units are installed, it is on you to find help with the patching and painting.
As you can see, both options are invasive, although somewhat less so than installing a conventional ducted system. But if you can bear the cost and chaos, you will be rewarded with cool.
We want to replace our undercounter ice maker, and I keep hearing about better, bar-quality ice that some machines offer. What should we be looking for?
The chief attribute of a great ice maker is its ability to produce clear, or "gourmet," ice. Clear ice is much denser than its cloudier, low-market friends, which are suffused with air. This means it takes longer for clear ice to melt and dilute your drink. Furthermore, clear-ice makers generally have water filtration and self-cleaning capabilities, adding taste (or, really, lack of taste) to their benefits. Clear ice will cost you, though. A conventional full-size ice maker can be as little as $ 300, while clear is priced in the $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 range.
Beyond density and taste, different ice shapes have alleged advantages. Crescent-shaped ice as produced by Isotherm ( $ 1,550) is valued because it fits curved glasses and moves freely in a drink without clumping. Octagonal cubes like those Manitowoc ( $ 1,789) makes, and cylindrical (also known as top hat) cubes offered by Hoshizaki ( $ 1,905), are considered optimal for their long frozen lives and good looks. If you still prefer the classic cube shape, you can find it from companies like Whynter for $ 1,069.
I have been looking for contemporary pendant lighting for our terrace and find that most things are "soft modern" and a little boring. Is there anything out there that is clean and minimal without being a snore?
Plenty of statement lighting is available at a variety of prices. At the high end you could try Marset's Soho Pendant, a large shaded factory-inspired fixture made of polyethylene. It is available in 22-inch ( $ 2,409) and 44-inch ( $ 6,058) diameters. Another great polyethylene option is Modoluce's Campanone Pendant, also offered in two diameters: 13 inches ( $ 1,000) and 20 inches ( $ 1,400). The light's elongated domed shape, reminiscent of Jujubes candy, comes in colors, including white, orange and red. Foscarini makes the frosted white cloudlike Gregg pendant in three sizes that are meant to be used alone or in a group; the diameters range from 12 inches ( $ 500) to 23 inches ( $ 912 with LED). Lower on the price scale, Shades of Light offers the Shaped Concrete Dome Pendant -- sort of a cement Hershey's Kiss; the 15-inch-diameter light is $ 218. Among the many synthetic wicker pendants is the orb-like Pacifica Outdoor Pendant, which comes in three diameters, 13.5 inches ( $ 228), 20 inches ( $ 328) and 26 inches ( $ 448).
I'm moving into a house and buying lots of things as well as picking paint colors. Should I be considering Pantone's color of the year -- Living Coral -- for my new digs?
While a single color might safely inspire your choice of a new pair of sneakers or a blender, it shouldn't motivate you to kit out your place all at one go. (For that matter, nothing should.) If you adhered to the Pantone color of the year for the past three years, you'd be living in a Tang orange, Grimace purple and Kermit green world more appropriate for a Teletubbies set than an adult abode. If you like color, go with the colors you like. If you like Living Coral, use it as an accent. And if you want to paint a room in a Pantone-approved annual shade try dialing back to 2016's Rose Quartz doing business as millennial pink, which is no doubt lingering in home furnishings because it is more subtle and suitable.

Texto completo: Whether you're a lifelong pet owner or a first-time adopter, a trip to a rowdy and crowded vet's office can be a frazzling experience. I was once so distracted by my dog Sutton's incessant licking of her lips, an indicator of stress, that I forgot all about my mental checklist of questions until after the appointment ended.
If your attention is easily diverted by your pet's antics or you get nervous around doctors, make a plan. To ensure history doesn't repeat itself, I now save my questions, along with my pet's medical history and dietary notes or troubling symptoms, to my phone ahead of every visit.
Dr. Leni Kaplan, a clinician and lecturer with Cornell's Small Animal Community Practice, said in an email interview that owners shouldn't feel embarrassed by coming in with a list of questions. "Veterinarians have pets, too, and have often faced the exact challenges our clients face," she said. "The more questions we can answer, the more successful owners and veterinarians will be in delivering the best care possible." Here's what both novice and experienced pet owners should always ask their vet at their next wellness exam.
What should I be feeding my pet?
Browsing the scores of pet food options on a store's shelves -- each one enticing you with images of real ingredients and happy-go-lucky pets, and labeled with marketing buzzwords such as "handcrafted" or "grain-free" -- can be overwhelming. Your vet can steer you toward the food that's ideal for your pet's age, breed, size and activity level.
"Veterinarians can and should offer advice on feeding, not the high school kid at the food store," said Dr. Karen Louis, a veterinarian and owner of Metro East Vet in Belleville, Illinois. "Some pet food companies have hired marketing teams that are positively brilliant at confusing pet owners."
How's my pet's weight?
My dog Sutton's four-legged sister is a fluffy Maine-coon mix named Tanzie. For a time I attributed Tanzie's robust appearance to her thick coat -- until the day a friend called her "fat." Even though I couldn't see the chonk, my vet later confirmed my cat was indeed overweight.
"It can be difficult to assess a pet's weight if they are fluffy and even harder to notice changes in weight when we see our pets every day," said Dr. Karen Fine, a veterinarian with Central Animal Hospital in Leominster, Massachusetts.
No kidding. A 2018 clinical survey by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention reported that 55.8 percent of dogs and 59.5 percent of cats are overweight or obese. Among all pet owners surveyed, 68 percent said they wanted their vet to recommend a routine or maintenance diet for their pet.
Dr. Fine added that weight gain can put pets at risk for diabetes and heart disease (not to mention shorten their lifespans, according to a study in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine). Being underweight, in contrast, may point to a parasitic infection or chronic illness. So ask your vet about what the changes in your pet's weight mean and, if necessary, the best way to get things back on track.
How much exercise do they need?
Exercise helps people bond with their pets, aids in the pets' weight loss and curbs behavioral issues such as furniture scratching or trash rummaging. Although all pets need daily exercise, professionals agree the amount varies by a pet's age, breed and medical history.
Puppies that get short bursts of energy throughout the day, known as "the zoomies," need several daily play sessions or short walks to tucker them out, which is safer than one long session on their growing bodies. Samantha Aline Pierre, a licensed veterinary technician with Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, said that "large breed dogs, living in the city, should be walked two to three times a day" in addition to engaging in regular play. But sedentary adult dogs such as Chihuahuas and Great Danes may need less physical and mental stimulation. And short-nosed dogs such as bulldogs have respiratory issues that make exercise difficult.
Most indoor cats need about 30 minutes of play a day, divided into two sessions. Pierre favors cat-sized hamster wheels, although any exercise tool will do. Fishing-pole toys with feathers, crinkle balls and puzzle feeders should do the trick if your cat isn't trained to leash-walk. (Wirecutter, the product review site owned by The New York Times Company, has recommendations for dog-walking harnesses, leashes and cat-enrichment toys.)
A veterinarian can offer an exercise regimen appropriate for your pet, as well as warning signs of overexertion so you know when it's time for a cool-down. They may also refer you to an accredited animal behaviorist or trainer for further insights into your pet's ideal activity level and how to manage behavioral issues.
How do their teeth and gums look?
Pets are adept at hiding their pain, so some owners may overlook dental care until symptoms become unavoidable. Stinky breath, rotting teeth or loss of appetite can mean periodontal disease, or worse, an infection in the heart, known as endocarditis. Your pet's doctor will check for early signs of infection at an annual wellness exam and propose a revised treatment plan.
"Similar to people, dogs and cats develop periodontal disease if their teeth are not brushed daily and oral health is not maintained," Dr. Kaplan said.
Can you explain my bill?
Pet owners trust professionals to guide them on what's needed to keep pets happy and healthy. Yet the recommendations aren't always affordable. Last year the American Pet Products Association reported that the average routine vet visit cost $ 182 for cats and $ 257 for dogs -- and that surgical visits cost almost double.
The best veterinary clinics are up front about the costs of treatments they recommend as well as the associated benefits and risks. If the quoted fees turn your face pale, tell your vet about your budget so you can agree on a cost-effective treatment plan that won't compromise your pet's well-being. If you have pet insurance that you'd like to use to offset some of the costs, keep in mind you'll need a detailed receipt to submit to your plan for reimbursement -- only a few insurers link up with clinics directly to share billing and payment info. (Wirecutter recommends Trupanion's plan for most cats and dogs.)
"Veterinarians are trained to offer the best, but not every owner can afford the 'Cadillac treatment,"' Dr. Louis said. "If something doesn't make sense on the estimate, ask. Many times the 'Honda Civic treatment' works fine."
Questions go both ways
Before you get to your questions, expect your vet to ask about your pet's diet, behavioral changes and prescriptions, such as anxiety meds or pest preventives. To ensure you don't forget anything, jot down the food and medication names, feeding frequencies and dosages.
Documenting your pet's routine and any questions you have ahead of time ensures that you won't get rattled by your pet's nervous behavior at the clinic. "Since our pets can't talk, it's up to us to give the vet as much information as possible," said Kim Crawford, the president of Friends with Four Paws, an Oklahoma-based animal rescue group. "You are the voice for your pet; don't settle. Your pet's health and well-being are in your hands."

Texto completo: Re "1,000 words: Highlands Ranch, Colo.," May 8
So common are school shootings like the one in suburban Denver on Tuesday, that the L.A. Times doesn't even bother to report it on the front page of its print edition. How many more children in this country will be terrorized by gun violence? Is there any issue more urgent that is not seriously discussed?
I say this to every single candidate running for president: Now is the time to stand up, speak up and make this the No. 1 priority for 2020. It is time to be bold and to change our gun culture, because lives depend on it and there isn't a minute to waste.

Words of consolation are meaningless when schools continue to be the target week after week, year after year, even decade after decade. Why don't we learn? Why don't we care enough to change this?
We have failed our children miserably; they deserve better than to go to school afraid for their lives.
Frances Terrell Lippman
Sherman Oaks
::
Liberal gun owner that I am, I hope (no doubt in vain) that my liberal brothers and sisters take a long breath before they begin banging the drum for more gun control after the most recent school shooting in Colorado.
Maybe then we can take a few moments to look hard and deep at the people closest to shooters who consistently know "absolutely nothing" about their friends' or loved ones' activities or motives.
The gun debate will go on forever; meanwhile, these killers do not materialize out of thin air.
Bob Loza
Big Bear Lake
::
It's a sad commentary on our nation that we've seen more than 40 school shooting so far this year. But it's even a sadder commentary on the L.A. Times that it reported on the shooting in Colorado with a three-sentence photo caption in its print edition.
Are you that numb to the mayhem inflicted on our children?

A Prop. 13-style tax revolt?
Re "Newsom faces a quandary of riches," May 7
Here's an idea for Gov. Gavin Newsom: Use some of California's budget surplus to institute a state gas tax moratorium until the base price of gasoline falls below $3.25 per gallon.
Use part of the surplus to offset the temporary loss of gas tax revenue earmarked to fix our road infrastructure, which was the excuse for instituting the last big state gas tax increase of 12 cents per gallon in November 2017 (with another 5.6 cent per gallon increase set for July 2019).
It makes no sense to tax people to death on a necessity like gasoline while the state's coffers are overflowing. Situations like this are what led to a thing called Proposition 13, where constituents finally had enough and took matters into their own hands.
Raising the gas tax when gasoline base prices are already through the roof, while ignoring the fact that substitute funding can be found in state coffers already filled to the brim, is the ultimate in tone deafness and will lead to a similar taxpayer revolt.
Jon Rowe
Costa Mesa
::
Where should California spend its budget surplus? This is a question for which the answer can be found in the pages of the L.A. Times this week.
The Los Angeles Unified School District needs teacher librarians and books for elementary school students. Children there and in other financially struggling districts deserve this.

Runners and testosterone
Re "Too much testosterone?" editorial, May 3
Caster Semenya, an Olympic gold-medal runner from South Africa, should be allowed to compete as she is. Here are the facts and data, as reported in the New York Times, that prove Semenya is being unfairly targeted by the International Assn. of Athletics Federations' policy to force people like her to take testosterone-reducing medication before competing.
The IAAF itself states that most women, including elite female athletes, have natural testosterone levels of 0.12 to 1.79 nanomoles per liter. The normal male range after puberty is much higher, at 7.7 to 29.4 nanomoles per liter.
Semenya has now been told that if she wishes to compete, she will have to take hormone-suppressing drugs and reduce her testosterone levels below 5 nanomoles per liter for six months before competing, and maintain those lowered levels.
The IAAF also allows transgender athletes to compete in major international competitions; transitioning women can compete with testosterone levels of 10 nanomoles per liter. This is double what Semenya is allowed.
Semenya is a woman, and she should be allowed to compete as she is, naturally.
Crista Worthy
Hidden Springs, Idaho
::
Regarding Semenya, the reigning Olympic champion in the women's 800-meter race, the issue is that she is a woman racing against other women.
If you want a truly level playing field, then have her compete against all comers, including men. This should apply to all sports -- basketball, swimming, tennis and so on.

A more efficient, bigger Medi-Cal
Re "Time to restore Medi-Cal," editorial, May 5
Instituting efficiencies into the Medi-Cal system could result in major savings and better service for California.
All 58 counties individually administer applications, process paperwork and conduct annual reviews of Medi-Cal recipients. The consolidation of these processes, especially "bundling" groups of counties into coalitions, would save tens of millions of dollars.
Every application for Medi-Cal resembles a full-blown IRS audit; this simply cannot be justified in terms of protecting the state or the program's integrity. Incidentally, Medi-Cal already has one of the largest, most sophisticated collection agencies in California, which is dedicated to collecting liens from deceased recipients and recovering funds from providers for overpayments.
In other words, the archaic process Medi-Cal uses to collect information from applicants can be largely replaced with current state resources.
Politicians are loathe to do the hard work of streamlining bureaucracies, but that's where the issues meet: If we use our current Medi-Cal funding more efficiently, we can help more people and expand benefits.
Michael McGuire
Palm Desert
The writer is an attorney with the California Elder Law Center.
::
Evidently, you missed the big demographic news this week: California's population growth rate in 2018 was the lowest on record.
We won't be able to encourage "younger, healthier Californians" to get insurance, pay taxes to support the expansion of Medi-Cal or do anything else if there aren't any of them.

Expand Medicare
Re "Insured, but still paying more," letters, May 7
Employment-based health insurance used to be a good deal. Not anymore. And every year it's getting worse.
Just ask young adults who live in the "gig economy" with off-and-on jobs that rarely provide any health insurance. Or ask those in middle age, often with children, who are forced to change their own and their children's doctors because employers change their insurance plans every year or two. Or ask those a bit older -- or younger -- who lose their jobs and their insurance completely.
It's not just that "soaring deductibles and medical bills" are pushing Americans to the financial breaking point, but also that both employment and health insurance have become frighteningly unreliable.
There is, however, one group in our nation that has affordable and reliable health insurance for as long as its members live: seniors with non-profit Medicare.
It's not perfect, but we can improve and expand Medicare to cover everybody -- for everyone's full lifetime.

Go global
Re "Centrism's toll," letters, May 8
I would be strongly attracted to a presidential candidate who proposed a Department of Globalization to address international trade, job retraining, immigration, climate change and economic policy, as an interconnected group of concepts to be coordinated in the interest of our nation.
These issues are currently addressed individually in separate departments.

Texto completo: Rick Gorka, who is about to take a top job on President Trump's 2020 campaign team, once told reporters to "kiss my ass" and "shove it."
A former aide to Mitt Romney, Gorka will join President Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign as the head of his regional communications team. He will oversee 50 regional communications staffers and report to Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director.
Gorka is best known as the traveling press secretary to Romney during his losing 2012 presidential campaign. During a fractious overseas trip, Gorka lost his temper with reporters as they lobbed questions at him when he visited the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, Poland.
When Gorka told the journalists to "show some respect" a New York Times reporter protested: "We haven't had another chance to ask a question." Gorka had clearly had enough, shooting back: "Kiss my ass. This is a holy site for the Polish people. Show some respect."
Moments later, Gorka told Jonathan Martin, then a Politico reporter to "shove it." He subsequently called reporters to apologize. Rucker later wore a "What about you gaffes?" T-shirt that he got signed by Romney.
iFrame Object
Gorka currently works as the deputy communications director for the Republican National Committee. Despite his outburst, Gorka was popular among journalists, describing his time with them on the campaign trail as like "a dysfunctional family with too much alcohol."

This is an opportunity to see three legendary songwriters perform together on one stage. With three voices and three guitars, Three Women and The Truth shares the hard-won wisdom from lifetimes spent in pursuit of the song.
Gilkyson is a twice Grammy-nominated folk singer whose songs have been covered by Joan Baez, Bob Geldof and Rosanne Cash. She has won countless Folk Alliance and Austin Music awards, including 2014’s Songwriter of the Year.
Peters, a member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, has written songs for artists from Etta James to Bonnie Raitt and The Neville Brothers. In 2015, U.K. newspaper The Telegraph named her one of the greatest 60 female singer-songwriters of all time.
Gauthier, named by the Associated Press as one of the best songwriters of her generation, has released albums that have garnered praise from the LA Times and the New York Times (“best independent release of the year”). Her most recent release, “Rifles & Rosary Beads” (a collection of songs co-written with wounded veterans), was nominated for 2018’s Record of the Year by the Americana Music Association.
Tickets for Three Women and the Truth are $32 in advance and $35 at the door.

Brookline architect creates handy photo exhibit

Texto completo: Palms rolling out thick rounds of dough. Fingers flared out in a joyful embrace of the world, poised to come down on the buttons of a shining trumpet. Hands delicately placing a fresh, not-yet-dried chocolate truffle onto a massive baking sheet.
These are the types of images featured in a photo exhibit by Lynn Osborn at the Brookline Public Library. Over the course of six months, Osborn photographed 27 small businesses throughout town. She titled the final set of images “Works of Hand," as each of the locations specializes in handmade items or skills involving hands.
An advocate for the “old town neighborhood life," Osborn mourns the replacement of local shops with larger chains. With this project, she hopes to remind people of the hard work and skill involved in the creation of handcrafted goods. In addition, she strives to preserve history by capturing images of locales that may not remain in the community forever.
“I hope [viewers] say 'Oh wow, look! I didn't know all these people were in our town,' " Osborn said. “I hope they discover a shop to patronize, and I hope they realize how great it is in our neighborhood to have these places."
The exhibit can be found in the Gallery in Hunneman Hall and will remain there through June 12.
Osborn is not a photographer by profession, although she has dabbled at it since she was a young adult. She works in architecture and owns her own firm, Osborn Studio +. Osborn had previously created architecture exhibits at the library with other female architects and was friendly with the woman who organized the exhibits. When asked if she wanted to plan her own photo exhibit, Osborn agreed and got to work.
Her inspiration for the theme of the photo essay partially stemmed from a longtime interest in traditional handworks. She has served for about 10 years on the Board of the North Bennet Street School, a private vocational school in Boston. She also recalls being influenced by a photo piece published in 2012 in the New York Times Magazine that centered on the Steinway piano facory.
“They were just beautiful pictures that captured a little slice of history," Osborn said. “It was almost a reverence to the craft and a reverence to the place captured. It was wonderful."
She began by wandering from storefront to storefront in Brookline, asking if anyone was interested in participating. Toting along examples of her work, she left notes when business owners were too busy at that moment.
Self-described as a bit shy, Osborn had to force herself to approach potential subjects. Most, however, were quite willing to work with her. Just before pulling out her camera, she'd survey the space and break the ice with curious questions about the day-to-day of each business. Finally, she would start clicking away.
“It's a balance of a serious picture that shows respect and some engagement with them and a little bit of soul," Osborn said. “I think that's what makes a good portrait. And then something about their space too."
The photos in the exhibit are accompanied by blurbs detailing the history of each business, the lives of the owners, and a quirky fact. Jazz Shoe Repair, owned by Moscow native Yuriy Arutyunov, has been in business for over 40 years. Von Huene Workshop specializes in recorders and other historical woodwind instruments, as well as sheet music. New Paris Bakery on Cypress Street is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.
“Quite a few people have an immigrant background, which is always interesting to learn about," Osborn said. “There's so many interesting things — the people, the history, the products they make."

FBI chief: No illegal spying on Trump campaign

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- FBI Director Chris Wray said Tuesday that he does not consider court-approved FBI surveillance to be "spying" and said he has no evidence the FBI illegally monitored President Donald Trump's campaign during the 2016 election.

His comments at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing broke from Attorney General William Barr, who has described as "spying" FBI surveillance during its investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Barr has not said such surveillance was necessarily improper, but Trump nonetheless seized on those comments to suggest his campaign was spied on in an illegal and unprecedented act.

Asked by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., if he would say that the FBI is "spying" when it investigates suspected terrorists and mobsters while following "investigative policies and procedures," Wray replied, "Well, that's not the term I would use."

He added: "I believe that the FBI is engaged in investigative activity, and part of investigative activity includes surveillance activity of different shapes and sizes. And to me, the key question is making sure that it's done by the book, consistent with our lawful authorities. That's the key question. Different people use different colloquial phrases."

Wray declined to discuss in detail the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign because of an ongoing Justice Department inspector general probe into the origins of the Russia inquiry. Barr has said he expects the watchdog report to be done in May or June.

But asked whether he was aware of evidence that the FBI had illegally spied on the Trump campaign, Wray said, "I don't think I personally have any evidence of that sort."

Barr is investigating whether there was a proper basis for the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The recently concluded investigation from special counsel Robert Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and the Kremlin to tip the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

"The attorney general is seeking to understand better the circumstances at the department and the FBI relating to how this investigation started, and we're working to help him get that understanding," Wray said about the Justice Department's review. "I think that's part of his job and part of mine."

Barr didn't specify what he meant when he said he believed there had been spying on the Trump campaign, though he also said that he did not mean the word in a negative way. At a hearing last week, he described "spying" as a "good English word" encompassing "all forms of covert intelligence operations" and said he wouldn't back away from using it.

The FBI obtained a secret surveillance warrant in the fall of 2016 to monitor the communications of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, whose interactions with Russians several years earlier had raised law enforcement suspicions even before he joined the campaign.

The New York Times reported last week that the FBI sent a female government investigator posing as a research assistant to speak with ex-Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who was told by a Maltese professor in the spring of 2016 that Russia had "dirt" on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of stolen emails.

In his book about his entanglement in the Russia probe, "Deep State Target," Papadopoulos wrote that the woman, who identified herself as Azra Turk, asked him about his work with the Trump campaign.

"She wants to know: Are we working with Russia?" he wrote. He described her question as "creepy" and said he told her he had "nothing to do with Russia."

Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with the professor, Joseph Mifsud, and was sentenced to 14 days in prison.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — In an interview with NPR's "Morning Edition" today, Jill Biden told host Rachel Martin that "it's time to move on" from the controversy over her husband Joe Biden's handling of Anita Hill's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
After starting his presidential campaign, Biden called Hill to apologize. Hill says that his apology is not enough.
“I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, ‘I’m sorry for what happened to you,’” said Hill to the New York Times in April. “I will be satisfied when I know that there is real change and real accountability and real purpose. ”
Jill Biden's new memoir: 9 things we learned from 'Where the Light Enters'
Biden on Trump attacking family during election: 'They know how tough it’s going to be'
When asked why Joe Biden did not call to apologize until after he started his presidential campaign, Jill Biden responded that "Well, I guess it was just not the right time maybe. So, he wanted to call her. I think he didn't know whether she would take his call. "
Despite Hill's objections to the apology, Jill Biden believes that Joe Biden's apology should suffice.
"As he has said, I mean he's called Anita Hill, they've talked, they've spoken, and he said, you know, he feels badly," Jill Biden said. "He apologized for the way the hearings were run. And so now it's kind of — it's time to move on. "
According to Jill Biden, it was Joe Biden's decision alone to call Anita Hill to apologize for his conduct.
In October 1991, Anita Hill testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Senator Joe Biden, about sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. In graphic detail, Hill described Thomas' alleged misconduct during her time working with Thomas at the Department of Education and the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission.
Biden has faced criticism since then for not calling corroborating witnesses to support Hill's testimony, despite the willingness of several women to do so at the time. Thomas' nomination was referred out of committee, and he was later confirmed to the Court by a 52-48 vote.

Texto completo: BAGHDAD -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo scrapped a visit to Germany on Tuesday to make an unannounced trip to Iraq, pressing Iraqi leaders about what he called the increased dangers to Americans there from Iran's forces and allies.
Mr. Pompeo said he also used the four-hour visit to push what he described as Iraq's need to avoid dependence on neighboring Iran for power supplies including electricity.
The diversion to Iraq by Mr. Pompeo, who was in the midst of a four-day European tour, added to what is an escalating American effort to ostracize Iran, which the Trump administration has sought to vilify as the chief destabilizing force in the Middle East.
There was no immediate comment from the leaders of Iran, who contend that the United States is the region's core source of turmoil. But the increased tensions between the long-estranged countries has created fears of an armed confrontation.
The Iraq stopover followed new warnings by Mr. Pompeo and the White House national security adviser, John R. Bolton, that Iran and what they called its proxy forces appeared to be preparing for attacks against United States troops and other interests in the region.
Mr. Pompeo met with top Iraqi officials, including Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Alhakim and President Barham Salih.
"First of all, we talked to them about the importance of Iraq ensuring that it's able to adequately protect Americans in their country," Mr. Pompeo told reporters traveling with him after they had departed Baghdad. The Iraqis had "provided assurances that they understood that was their responsibility," he said.
"We don't want anyone interfering in their country, certainly not by attacking another nation inside of Iraq, and there was complete agreement," Mr. Pompeo said.
Iraqi officials were far more circumspect in their description of the meetings. "Both sides discussed the bilateral relations and the recent updates in the security of the region and efforts of fighting terrorism," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
Mr. Pompeo's visit, shrouded in secrecy until after it was over, came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Mr. Trump's repudiation of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and the reimposition of American sanctions, which have been increasingly squeezing Iran's economy. Iran said Monday it would no longer comply with parts of the agreement, alarming European officials who have hoped to preserve the accord, meant to ensure Iran's peaceful use of nuclear energy.
The choreography of Mr. Pompeo's Iraq stopover also appeared designed to send a message to Iran. Before he flew to Baghdad, the State Department said Mr. Pompeo, who had been in Finland, had abandoned a scheduled meeting in Berlin with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany because of unidentified "pressing issues."
The Trump administration has not provided specific details about what it has called the new threat from Iran, which has drawn some skepticism, given the history of faulty intelligence that led to the Iraq war. But officials have told The New York Times that new intelligence has raised concerns about Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its connections to some of Iraq's Shiite Arab militias.
Asked by reporters to elaborate, Mr. Pompeo said, "I just don't want to go into the details of that anymore." But he also reiterated his contention that the Revolutionary Guards is a terrorist organization. "This was just calling out the truth," he said.
It was Mr. Pompeo who last month placed the Revolutionary Guards on the State Department's list of foreign terrorist organizations, against the advice of American intelligence and Pentagon officials, who warned that Iran's clerical government could reciprocate and put United States personnel at risk in the Middle East.
Last week, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran declared all American forces in the Middle East terrorists and labeled the United States government a state sponsor of terrorism.
To counter what the Trump administration has described as the new threat, the Pentagon has expedited an already-scheduled deployment of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Pompeo said he also raised the issue of Iraq's energy requirements with his Iraqi hosts, who have been upset at American demands that it stop relying on imported Iranian power supplies. The Trump administration gave Iraq a waiver in March to purchase Iranian electricity without incurring American penalties, but that waiver is set to expire in June.
"We want them to have the opportunity to have multiple sources and a diverse energy base," Mr. Pompeo told reporters before his meetings. "We think that's better for an independent, sovereign Iraq."
Mr. Pompeo's trip coincided with news that Iraq is close to signing a $ 53 billion, 30-year agreement with Exxon Mobil and PetroChina to develop oil fields in southern Iraq.
Such deals, Mr. Pompeo said, "are important to Iraq -- big energy deals that can disconnect them from Iranian energy."
He was traveling from Finland, where he had attended an annual meeting of diplomats from Arctic nations. A State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said the "important set of meetings" that had been canceled in Berlin would be rescheduled.
Mr. Pompeo had been set to meet with Ms. Merkel and Heiko Maas, Germany's foreign minister, to discuss Ukraine, Russia, China, Syria, the Western Balkans and other issues, according to a schedule released by the State Department last week.
Germany has long considered the United States its most trusted ally, but relations have been badly strained under the administration of Mr. Trump, who has publicly chided Ms. Merkel and her government over issues including refugees and a planned gas pipeline with Russia. He has threatened to impose tariffs on automobile imports from Germany.
The chancellor's office and Germany's Foreign Ministry declined to comment officially on the decision, but both made clear that the cancellation had come from Mr. Pompeo's side.
Mr. Pompeo told reporters he had spoken with Mr. Maas on the plane ride to Baghdad to express regret about the cancellation.
"He understood completely," Mr. Pompeo said. "He also knows that our relationship with Iraq is important, and we're partners in the challenges that Iran presents to Germany and to Europe as well."
German commentators said the decision reflected what they called the deterioration of German-American relations.
"More than two years since Donald Trump came to power, much of that which for a long time was lauded as the German-American friendship now lies in pieces," read an opinion piece in the left-leaning daily Süddeutsche Zeitung.
At the Arctic Council meeting in Finland, Mr. Pompeo delivered a sharp warning to Russia and China about potential intervention in the region. He was still expected to meet in London on Wednesday with Prime Minister Theresa May and to deliver a speech on the United States' relationship with Britain. Mr. Pompeo was then to travel to Greenland on Thursday.

CITIZENSHIP CENSUS QUESTION COULD HURT POORER PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Texto completo: A potential citizenship question on the 2020 census could have far-reaching effects, including putting a squeeze on high-poverty school districts in Pennsylvania and beyond.
The measure, which President Donald Trump's administration proposed in 2018, is currently before the U.S. Supreme Court and a ruling is expected by the end of next month.
At issue is how the nation counts its population and whether a census questionnaire should include a question regarding a person's citizenship. Critics say the question could cause millions of immigrant families to decline to fill out the census forms if they are asked to name occupants who are not U.S. citizens, which would cause the federal government to undercount the number of noncitizens. That in turn would skew federal funding to states and localities that is driven by census figures.
Experts say such a ruling could have implications for school districts - particularly ones with a large percentage of impoverished students - that rely on federal funding based on formulas tied to population and poverty, although the potential dollar impact is unclear.
"To the extent that students in poverty might be reduced if that would turn out to be the case, then that would have some impact," said Jay Himes, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officers. "I couldn't hazard to guess to what extent, but it would have an impact."
The state Department of Education administers federal programs and funding worth $700 million each year to 570 local education agencies across Pennsylvania, according to its website.
Federal aid supports resources that include the National School Lunch Program, the Head Start preschool program, and grants to states under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
The largest federal program for schools is called Title I, which supports schools with high percentages of children from low-income families.
In poorer school districts like Sto-Rox - where 85% of its students are economically disadvantaged - Title I helps pays for resources such as specialists who give extra help to struggling readers.
"When all that money is delayed or decreased, or doesn't come at all, we have nowhere to turn other than to eliminate what we've been able to provide through federal dollars," said Superintendent Frank Dalmas. "It impacts us greatly."
Although the extent of any potential funding dips related to the proposed census change is unclear, Mr. Dalmas said that even small shifts matter in high-poverty school districts: "We feel the pinch immediately."
Mr. Himes noted that the ruling could also have implications for state funding. Pennsylvania's basic education funding formula incorporates median household income and poverty rates. Census data provides an estimate of how many students live in poverty in a district's attendance area.
The question could discourage would-be respondents from participating in the census, "and anything that depresses participation isn't helpful," said Gregg Behr, executive director of The Grable Foundation, a Pittsburgh-based philanthropic organization.
"Whatever the court decides, we'll be ready here in Pittsburgh and in Allegheny County," he wrote in an email. "Our local efforts are underway to make sure we will count everyone, to make sure that everyone knows that they belong."

New York Times editorial board tells Congress to ‘give Trump his border money’

Texto completo: The New York Times editorial board urged Congress to give President Trump the administration’s requested $4.5 billion in emergency funding for the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.
“President Trump is right: There is a crisis at the southern border,” the editorial board wrote Sunday in a piece titled, “Congress, Give Trump his Border Money.”
“There is no pressing national security threat — no invasion of murderers, drug cartels or terrorists. No matter how often Mr. Trump delivers such warnings, they bear little resemblance to the truth,” it said.
There has been a surge of migrants crossing into the U.S., despite Trump’s efforts to curtail illegal immigration. Some Democrats view granting Trump’s request for emergency funds as legitimizing his immigration stances they have railed against, but denying Trump’s request also puts them in the awkward position of turning down assistance for the migrants seeking asylum.
[Related: Number of Democrats concerned about illegal immigration more than triples]
Most of that funding would be used for humanitarian needs, the editorial board noted.
“None of the money would go toward Mr. Trump’s border wall,” it wrote. “Several hundred million dollars would, however, go toward shoring up border security operations, including increasing the number of detention beds overseen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. This, for Democrats, is a nonstarter.”
“But until better policies are in place, Democrats need to find a way to provide money for adequate shelter,” the board continued, encouraging both Democrats and the White House to be open to conditions from the other side of the aisle.

Voting machines considered secure; Expert vouches for paper ballot system council hesitates to buy

Texto completo: Last month, Northampton County Council held off buying voting machines after members of the county election commission raised concerns about the devices about to be purchased.
But a nationally recognized voting machine expert told The Morning Call that the machines - which were based on a system he designed - should not pose a security concern.
Juan Gilbert, chairman of the department of computer and information science and engineering at the University of Florida, was part of a committee of experts and academics that wrote "Securing the Vote: Protecting American Democracy" for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The report warned that intrusions by foreign powers have exposed weaknesses in America's voting systems and recommended that all voting methods produce a paper trail that can be read and audited.
For more than a decade, dozens of counties across Pennsylvania, including Lehigh and Northampton, relied on voting systems where votes were cast on machines and saved electronically. While the machines are not connected to the internet and are difficult to hack, the devices leave voters with no way to know if their votes are being recorded correctly. Just as bad, if a machine malfunctioned, hundreds or thousands of votes could potentially be lost, Gilbert said; that happened in Florida in November, according to The New York Times.
"Our No. 1 priority is you need a paper ballot. Given the current state of technology, there is no way to secure a digital ballot," Gilbert said.
In Northampton County, the election commission voted 3-2 for Election System and Software's ExpressVote XL, a system where each voter selects candidates on a touch screen. Once they're done, the machine prints a copy of their ballot for the voter to review. If the paper receipt matches their intent, the voter presses a button to record the vote, and the paper receipt is secured in the machine for a future audit.
Kathy Fox, a member of the election commission who voted against the machine, raised concerns about the system's security at Northampton County Council's April 18 meeting. The paper receipts list the voter's selected candidates, but the system reads the receipts through a bar code printed at the top, she said. Since humans cannot read bar codes, voters cannot be certain the bar code matches their actual vote, she said.
"Programming errors, malfunctions and hacking could change what the voters selected, and they would never know," Fox said.
After Fox, fellow election commission member Debbie Hunter and others raised concerns about the selection process and the ExpressVote XL security, council delayed its decision on the $2.9 million voting machine contract until May 16, after Delaware uses ExpressVote XL machines in its state primary races.
But Gilbert said county officials would discover if there were a problem if they do a thorough audit of the voting system, which is the point of switching voting machines. If bar codes don't match what's been printed on the receipts, election officials will be able to tell.
If anything, he said, devices like the ExpressVote XL are more secure than paper ballots. If a voter doesn't like the candidates in a race and leaves the slot blank, an unscrupulous vote counter could fill in the ballot during the audit process. Unless the corrupt official was caught red-handed or on film, there would be no way to prove the fraud, Gilbert said.
"If I looked at hand-marked paper ballots, ballot marking devices [like the ExpressVote XL] have a slight edge. But you have got to do an audit," he said.
The ExpressVote XL system mimics the Prime III voting machine Gilbert invented, which is used in New Hampshire. Gilbert didn't patent his machine, hoping that others would borrow the security features he used. The ExpressVote XL was created by the company Elections Systems and Software, which added proprietary software and designs, Gilbert said.
Experts began focusing on the need for a paper trail after the 2016 election cycle, when Russian hackers tried to break into voter databases in several states, including Pennsylvania. In February 2018, Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order mandating all counties have election systems featuring a paper trail by the 2020 presidential election cycle.
In Lehigh County, officials unanimously voted to go with a paper ballot system. Voters will scan their selections into an optical reader, which will quickly count the results. The paper ballots are kept by election officials so the results can be audited.
Can County Council refuse to purchase voting machines?
While County Council postponed its decision about the voting machine contract, it's unclear if it has the legal authority to reject the election commission's decision. State law empowers boards of elections to buy voting devices and equip polling places as they sees fit, so long as the items have been certified by the state.
Northampton County has a home rule charter, which means it operates with a different system of government than most counties, but the charter says the election commission serves the same role as a board of elections. In Lehigh County, which operates under a similar home rule charter, the board of elections makes the final decision, and county commissioners do not need to approve equipment purchases.
Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure said his administration believes council does not have the authority to reject the purchase of the machines. However, he acknowledged the charter empowers council with oversight of the budget and the right to approve or reject most contracts over $100,000. There is no clear answer on the matter until a judge weighs in, he said, but he hoped county officials could resolve the matter without going to court.
"This isn't settled law," McClure said.
Christopher Spadoni, council's solicitor, said no one on council has asked him to offer a legal opinion on whether council can legally reject the voting machine contract. When asked if council had that ability, he declined to comment other than to say he has researched the matter.
"I have my ducks in a row," he said.

A First for U.S. Pageants: Black Women Hold All 3 Major Titles at the Same Time

Texto completo: Despite a long history of segregation and racism, America's top pageants have broken racial barriers in recent decades. Vanessa Williams became the first black woman to win the Miss America title in 1984. Carole Gist won Miss USA in 1990. Janel Bishop won Miss Teen USA in 1991.
Each competition has had multiple black winners since.
Last week, for the first time, black women wore the crowns of all three major pageants simultaneously.
Cheslie Kryst, 28, won the Miss USA contest, and Kaliegh Garris, 18, won Miss Teen USA. They joined Nia Franklin, 25, who was crowned as the 2019 Miss America in September.
The three wins have become a powerful symbol of how much American views on beauty have evolved from a past marred by racism and gender stereotypes, even as black women leaders are still severely underrepresented in other fields, like corporate America or in Congress.
"It is important to little brown and black girls to see three strong figures, three strong women, African-American women that are doing so much great work," Ms. Franklin said on Saturday. "People will argue that race doesn't matter. But race does matter in America, because of the history, because of slavery."
News of the pageant wins resonated with many on Saturday, drawing words of support from the actress Halle Berry and Senator Kamala Harris, who is vying for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination, among other influential figures.
"Nia, Cheslie, and Kaliegh: you are trailblazers, creating your own path on your own terms," Ms. Harris said on Twitter.
The attention comes as the country increasingly rethinks long-held gender norms, spurred on by the #MeToo movement. Pageants have recently sought to put more emphasis on the offstage lives of the women and girls, highlighting their accomplishments and charity work, instead of only their appearances.
The Miss Universe Organization, which runs Miss USA and Miss Teen USA, began allowing transgender women to participate in 2012. Last year, the Miss America Organization announced it would end the swimsuit contest, among other changes.
It's the racial history of pageants that the "trifecta of black winners" perhaps highlights the most, said Ashley Nkadi, a former Miss Black Ohio who has written about the pageants' past.
"I think the image of it is very important, especially knowing where mainstream pageantry has come from," she said.
Black women have long been underrepresented in the contests, said Elwood Watson, a professor of history and African-American studies at East Tennessee State University. For decades, they were barred from Miss America contests.
"They have always been seen as 'the other,' and white women have always been the standard of beauty," he said.
The 1968 Miss America pageant held in Atlantic City is one of the most infamous examples of that dynamic. The competition was held as a fight for civil rights raged across the country; only white women were in the pageant.
On the boardwalk outside, feminists threw bras, curling irons and false eyelashes into a trash can to condemn the scrutiny of women's bodies by male judges.
Four blocks away, in a Ritz-Carlton hotel, another ceremony was held, crowning 19-year-old Saundra Williams as the first ever Miss Black America, in protest of the "white stereotype," The New York Times reported.
"Miss America does not represent us because there has never been a black girl in the pageant," she said. "With my title, I can show black women that they too are beautiful."
There have been a number of milestones since then. As the 1970 Miss Iowa, Cheryl Browne became the first black contestant to compete in the Miss America contest. Ms. Franklin said she is the ninth black Miss America.
The 2019 winners are not strangers to racism. Ms. Franklin recalled that when she was 9, she was called a racial slur and told to go back to Africa. Ms. Kryst said she has been told that she was "pretty for a black girl."
"Of course there are going to be parts of me that have experienced racism," Ms. Franklin said. "It hasn't stopped me. I have come through this Miss America system with strength and pride and grace."
But Ms. Nkadi said more representation is needed. Pageant winners typically are not "plus-size" or do not have darker skin, she said.
"I definitely still think the Eurocentric beauty model still dominates," she said.
Diversity in pageantry hasn't reached many groups, said Hilary Levey Friedman, a visiting professor of education at Brown University, who has studied pageants. Ms. Friedman said Latina and Asian women have struggled to be represented.
"Increasing the diversity overall is definitely a conversation to be had," she said.

Texto completo: A Times editorial

Special counsel Robert Muellers report indicates the FBI believes Russians hacked into at least one Florida countys election system in 2016. Sen. Marco Rubio recently said the Russian hackers were in a position to change voter roll information. Its time Floridians know exactly what happened, which county or counties were hacked and how state and local elections officials will prevent similar interference in the 2020 elections.

In the run-up to the 2016 election, VR Systems, a vendor that handles voter registration software for most of the states 67 counties, warned local supervisors of elections that someone had created an email account meant to look like it was coming from the company and was sending attachments stuffed with malware. Months later in an intelligence report, the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency said that Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards, but that no vote counts were compromised. That is pretty much where matters stood publicly until Muellers report was released and included this disturbing revelation: The FBI believes that this operation enabled the (Russian military intelligence agency) GRU to gain access to the network of at least one Florida county government.

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Rubio confirmed there was an intrusion by Russian hackers but that it does not appear they actually acted to change voter roll information. Thats a relief. Yet Rubio acknowledges the local elections officials who were the target or targets were never told and only a general warning was issued to protect national intelligence operations.

Its past time for clarity. As Gov. Ron DeSantis says, They wont tell us which county it was. Are you kidding me? The governor plans on getting some answers, and those answers should be shared with all Floridians. Its not necessary to reveal any state secrets or computer code. It is necessary to know which county or counties had their voter roll information accessed, and what general steps are being taken to prevent that from happening again in 2020.

The new information also provides some clarity about a dust-up during last years U.S. Senate race. Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson said then that he and Rubio had been asked by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to publicize fears about Russian hacking in Floridas elections systems but couldnt elaborate because the information was classified. Nelson did claim that hackers had breached a voter registration system. But the FBI refused to share any information to corroborate his assertion, which left Nelson to twist in the wind as his opponent, then-Gov. Rick Scott, repeatedly criticized him. In an October debate, Scott went so far as to accuse Nelson of lying about Russian hacking. Scott, who narrowly defeated Nelson, owes Nelson an apology.

The only good news in this sorry mess is that the vote totals themselves were not compromised. The systems in question involve only voter rolls and registration, not the voting itself. But hackers could potentially create havoc and chaos by manipulating the rolls themselves, so its cold comfort knowing that they couldnt change the actual vote totals. As Rubio told the Times: My biggest concern is that on Election Day you go vote and have mass confusion because voter registration information has been deleted from the systems.

The hackers know what they did. Theres a great benefit to the public and those who supervise Floridas elections knowing what happened and why. The FBI apparently has agreed to brief DeSantis and Scott soon, but its incumbent on the FBI to disclose all that it can to the public as quickly as it can for Florida officials to prepare for a secure election in 2020 and for voters to have confidence in the integrity of the system.

Texto completo: La lidereza de la mayoría en la Cámara, Nancy Pelosi , dejó claro que un juicio político contra el presidente Donald Trump sería complicado para removerlo de la Casa Blanca.
La representante de San Francisco, California, es parte del grupo demócrata que no quiere enfocar recursos a ello, como otra ala del partido y congresistas que presionan para concretarlo.
Pelosi dijo a The New York Times que la única forma de remover al mandatario republicano es a través de las urnas, ganando por un amplio margen, ya que teme que el presidente Trump quiera desafiar la legitimidad de la contienda electoral 2020.
“Tenemos que vacunarnos contra eso, tenemos que estar preparados para eso” , dijo Pelosi.
La demócrata es fría al hablar sobre el juicio político hacia el mandatario, considera que si éste pudiera avanzar en la Cámara –donde iniciaría la petición– en el Senado esa idea quedaría sepultada, ya que está controlada por republicanos.
“Si ganamos por cuatro escaños, por mil votos cada uno, no va a respetar las elecciones”, consideró Pelosi. “Él envenenaría a la opinión pública. Él desafiaría a cada una de las razas; él diría que no puedes sentar a estas personas” .
Insistió que los demócratas deberán ganar con amplio margen.
La más reciente encuesta de Harvard / Harris indica que el único que, por ahora, los votantes consideran viable es al exvicepresidente Joe Biden .

Roe case resonates,even today

Texto completo: While constitutional lawyers, ethicists and theologians - in descending order of importance in the abortion debate - have been arguing in the 46 years since the Supreme Court attempted to settle the debate, technologists have been making a
contribution to it. They have developed machines that produce increasingly vivid sonograms of fetal development.
This concreteness partially explains the intensification of the debate.
Six states have passed "heartbeat bills" to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, approximately six weeks after conception. Such bills are, indeed, unconstitutional given the court's Roe ukase that abortion cannot be restricted before a fetus is viable outside the womb - which means, presumably, before the fetus is a child.
But why should "viability" be the dispositive criterion? Viable means capable of surviving outside the womb, which no infant can do without constant help that others must give. Must. No infants are "viable" in that all are helpless, and the law requires that help be given by those responsible for the infant.
A New York Times editorial (Dec. 28, 2018) opposing the idea that "a fetus in the womb has the same rights as a fully formed person" spoke of these living fetuses - that they are living is an elementary biological fact, not an abstruse theological deduction - as "clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings." Now, delete the obfuscating and constitutionally irrelevant adjective "viable," and look at a sonogram of a ten-week fetus. Note the eyes and lips, the moving fingers and, yes, the beating heart. Is this most suitably described as a "cluster of cells" or as a baby?
The "heartbeat bills" are wholesome provocations: One of their aims is to provoke thinking about the moral dimension of extinguishing a being with a visibly beating heart. Furthermore, pro-life people are being provoked in different ways.
Last month, Kansas' Supreme Court found in this from the state constitution - "All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" - a reason to overturn the state's ban on D&E (dilation-and-evacuation) abortions that involve dismemberment of the living fetus. In February, after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order to enforce taxpayer-funded abortions, Democratic legislators decided that was enough. They introduced a bill to create a right to abortion for any reason at any point in a pregnancy, a bill similar to legislation enacted or advancing in other Democratic-controlled states. In February, all but three Democratic U.S. senators opposed, thereby killing, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse's Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that would have required the survivor receive the standard professional care that would be given to any child born alive at the same gestational age.
The 1850s debates that propelled Abraham Lincoln to greatness concerned not whether slavery should be abolished forthwith, but rather, the debates concerned two other questions: Would national policy stigmatize slavery as a tragic legacy and a moral wrong? And would policy confine slavery to its existing dominion by banning it from the territories, thereby, putting it on a path to ultimate extinction?
Temperate pro-life advocates consider the abortion debate akin to the slavery debates for three reasons: Abortion shrinks the scope of the concept of personhood. The issue has been inflamed by judicial fiat (Roe v. Wade as Dred Scott v. Sandford).
The changed composition of the Supreme Court, and the supposed imminent danger that Roe will be overturned, is the excuse that pro-abortion extremists have seized upon to do what they want: to normalize extreme abortion practices expressive of the belief that never does fetal life have more moral significance than a tumor in a mother's stomach.

Texto completo: Casey Cep's highly anticipated new book "Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee" is the stunning story of an Alabama serial killer and the true crime book that Harper Lee worked on in the years after "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Admission is free. Copies of the book will be sold at the event Tuesday 6-7 p.m. at the Alabama Department of Archives and History, 624 Washington Ave., Montgomery. Refreshments will be served.
Cep is a writer from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. After graduating from Harvard with a degree in English, she earned a M.Phil in Theology from Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Her work has appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times, and The New Republic, among other publications. This is her first book and this event will be Cep's first presentation of the book in Alabama.
The Rev. Willie Maxwell was a rural preacher in Alabama accused of murdering five of his family members for insurance money in the 1970s. With the help of a savvy lawyer, he escaped justice for years until a relative shot him dead at the funeral of his last victim.
Despite hundreds of witnesses, Maxwell's murderer was acquitted–thanks to the same attorney who had previously defended the Reverend. Sitting in the audience during the vigilante's trial was Harper Lee, who had traveled from New York City to her native Alabama with the idea of writing a true-crime novel.
Lee spent many years working on her own version of the case.
Now Cep brings this story to life, from the shocking murders and the courtroom drama to the racial politics of the Deep South. At the same time, she offers a deeply moving portrait of one of the country's most beloved writers and her struggles with fame, success, and the mystery of artistic creativity.
For more information about the book talk, call Alex Colvin, (334) 353-4689.
On May 7 author Casey Cep will present a book talk on "Furious Hours."

Texto completo: Human Archipelago
Fazal Sheikh and Teju Cole
Steidl, 256 pp., $45

--
"Who is the stranger?
Who is kin?
What do we owe each other?
What, in the inferno, is not infernal?"
Thus opens "Human Archipelago," a quietly powerful collaboration between writer Teju Cole and photographer Fazal Sheikh. Created in response to the inferno of the current global political moment, the book intersperses Sheikh's photographs of displaced people and sites of trauma across the globe with short, textual responses by Cole, himself a photographer, writer and photography critic for the New York Times Magazine. The result is a poetic, episodic meditation on nothing less than what it means to be human.
In other, less fraught political times, this ambition might have come across as pretentious. The appeal to a universal humanity would have seemed naive, or worse, reductive, reminiscent of Edward Steichen's much-criticized 1955 exhibition and book, "The Family of Man." But in these times, when basic human dignity is assaulted in lethal and symbolic ways every day, it feels wholly necessary to return to first principles.
Sheikh's portraits are frank, beautifully framed and lit; they give the dignity of portraiture -- traditionally reserved for aristocrats and the wealthy -- to refugees, homeless people and orphans. For the most part, the subjects' gazes are direct, unflinching. They look back at us, person to person. By contrast, the landscapes and aerial views are dispassionate, atmospheric, often bordering on abstraction. Their beauty belies that many are records of violence, ruins of aggression, sites of imprisonment. Both people and places bear the scars of a human pact that has been broken.
Cole's short textual responses -- none longer than a page, most barely a paragraph -- read like prose poems. They draw on multiple, far-flung sources, from Homer and Shakespeare to Martin Luther King Jr., postcolonial theory and recent news stories on racial profiling. They proffer meditations on the bounds of our common humanity: the stranger and the obligations of hospitality; the bonds between mothers and children; who speaks and who is silenced. Throughout, the texts return in fugue-like fashion to these concepts, building in a slow crescendo to a quiet rage against racism, torture, war, environmental degradation and our own blindness. "We've tried to tell you in every different way and can only now conclude you'd rather not know," he writes, despairingly.
The alternating texts and images feel almost cinematic, illuminating each other or creating unexpected juxtapositions. Commenting on portraits of older people, Cole compares their wrinkled faces to the folds of cloth draped around their heads: "We are folded beings. Our skin, which is our interface (the word is carefully chosen) with the world, is a zone of folds." It's a touching conceit, that a person might be a collection of folds, of unknown depths that might one day unfurl before you.
Another particularly lovely sequence takes advantage of the bilateral symmetry of the book. It's all images, pairing portraits of Palestinians and Israelis on opposite pages. When one closes the book, it's as if they kiss.
There's only one problem. You wouldn't know they were Palestinians and Israelis unless you looked for the captions in the back of the book. Similarly, it was only by flipping back and forth that I learned what looked like a pockmarked wall was actually an aerial view of the remains of a WWII Japanese American internment camp.
Footnote chasers like me will find our enjoyment of the book's lyricism hampered somewhat by the compulsion to know at whom and what we're looking. To be sure, a stream of notes would have interrupted the book's clean design and our ability to regard its subjects simply as people, apart from racial, ethnic, national, class, religious, gender or geographical associations. However, their absence turns the subjects into generalized symbols of human suffering, unmoored from specific historical and contemporary realities. It makes it easy to extend our sympathy without having to confront very real differences of circumstance, background and belief.
Yet this appeal to something larger is Cole and Sheikh's point: Why should the ruins of an American internment camp be any more affecting than the ruins of a bombed-out Palestinian town? Both are evidence of disregard for our shared humanity. As Cole writes, "There are no refugees, only fellow citizens whose rights we have failed to acknowledge."
In "Human Archipelago" this truth unfolds page by page, plain as day.

Texto completo: Es iz schwer tzu sein a yid. It is hard to be a Jew. — Sholem Aleichem
The recent deadly assault on the Chabad temple in Poway — just six months after a bloodier massacre in Pittsburgh — reflects the sad reality that anti-Semitism in all its hoary forms, is back.
This is, if anything, even more the case in Europe, where Jewish populations are under siege and are almost one-third as large as right after the Holocaust.
Sadly, confronted by such incidents, the Jewish community, reflecting the deep fissures of American society, seems divided by political orientation. The conservative faction, sometimes aligned to President Trump, focuses largely on growing anti-Semitism on the political left often downplayed by progressive Jews who focus on the scattered, albeit sometimes deadly, expression of anti-Semitism among scattered white nationalists.
The problem here is that both the far-right and the progressive left represent clear and present dangers to Jews around the world. The proper response to incidents at Poway, as well as those perpetrated by the political left, should not be division, but a common sense of unity in the face of a growing, and, until recently, largely unexpected threat.
The two faces of Jew-hatred
Historically, anti-Semitism has fed on two different, although sometimes aligned, perceptions. The first, dating back to classical times, was based on a notion of “otherness “. In ancient Greece and Rome, that was in large part because Jewish monotheism clashed with the dominant state-sanctioned polytheism. Later this hatred was reinforced by Christian, and later Muslim, intolerance. Jewish ideas may have underpinned both faiths, but the refusal to embrace “the true and only” divine relation infuriated religious zealots of the new religions.
In medieval societies, emerged a conspiratorial strain of anti-Semitism that maintained that a secret cabal of Jews was seeking, or even have achieved, world domination. This melding of the othering and conspiracy was mostly embraced on the right and turned into policy in Nazi Germany.
Even today the far right in Poland and other European countries — where roughly one in four hold anti-Semitic views — retains such memes even if their countries are largely judenrein. The unhinged alt-right of the Charlottesville marchers, as well as the lone wolf shooters in both Pittsburgh and Poway, embraced this particularly virulent ideology.
“The socialism of fools”
America’s progressive Jews, dominant in the non-Orthodox rabbinate, have had a harder time confronting the rise of left-wing anti-Semitism, which focuses on Jews as capitalist exploiters or Israel as a neo-colonialist power. The German social democratic leader August Bebel is widely credited describing this as “the socialism of fools.”
Groups like the Anti-Defamation League like to focus on right-wing hate groups, but their statistics have been roundly criticized in such respected magazine as Tablet, and are widely thought to reflect their predictably progressive bias.
Others accuse President Trump as inciting anti-Semitism. But despite his poorly chosen comments about “good people” on both sides in Charlottesville, Trump has been arguably the most pro-Israel president since Truman and the first president with Jewish grandchildren; for this, he was bitterly denounced by both the Pittsburgh and Poway shooters.
The progressive Jews own sense of moral superiority and desire to push “social justice” as the core of their identity — conflicts with the reality that , in both Europe and North America, the strongest anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel, political movements come from on the left. In Great Britain, for example, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has embraced the virulently anti-Jewish Hamas and attending ceremonies laying wreaths at the graves of such “heroes” as the terrorist killers at the 1972 Munich games.
Anti-Zionist, and anti-Jewish, sentiments are most commonly found in progressive bastions like college campuses, where “third world” oriented academics push “disinvestment” from Israel. Pitched merely as anti-Zionism, these same political warriors rarely favor actions against far more repressive states as China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Worse yet, , for the first time in decades, there are now anti-Semitic members of Congress , led by Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose pronouncements about Jews, money and “dual loyalty” have been tolerated by a party leadership intimidated by the rising left.
Normalizing anti-Semitism
We are witnessing the normalization of anti-Semitism. Democratic Presidential candidates, most recently Pete Buttigieg, seek out the blessings of the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton, a past dealer in anti-Semitic calumnies. The New York Times recently printed, in its International edition, a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu leading a blind, Kippur-wearing President Trump that would not have been out of place in Julius Streicher’s Nazi era Der Stürmer.
In Europe, far more than America, anti-Semitism is also rising on the right. In Belgium, Jewish caricatures have been on display at local festivals despite complaints. And in Germany, one official of the rightist Alternative for Germany party, dismissed the Holocaust as “a speck of birds*** in 1,000 years of glorious German history.”
Faced with what could become a permanent threat, Jews, and their friends in other religious communities, should confront anti-Semitism in all its forms. Divisions about fighting hatred serve to empower the haters, and make us all, of any faith, more vulnerable.

Barr corrupted the debate over the Mueller report

Texto completo: One of our most colorful legal concepts is the "fruit of the poisonous tree." The phrase was introduced by Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter 80 years ago to hold that evidence obtained illegally cannot be used to convict a defendant.
We now know that the entire debate the country has been having over special counsel Robert Mueller's report was fatally infected by the lethal sapling that was Attorney General William Barr's four-page letter offering his gloss on the findings of the 448-page document. As a dandruff shampoo ad taught us long ago, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.
It's not good enough that a redacted version of the report was eventually made public. For 27 days, the debate over Mueller's findings was twisted by Barr's poisonous distortions that implied a full exoneration of President Trump. Many public statements and much punditry were devoted to insisting that Trump's opponents owed the president an apology, that the Russia matter was never what it was cracked up to be, that the president was free and clear.
While it would be nice to see an outpouring of public apologies from those who were snookered by Barr, I am not anticipating a run on sackcloth. But it is very heartening -- but also, in light of Barr's subsequent conduct, very disturbing -- to know that one person who was infuriated by what Barr did was Mueller himself.
As The Washington Post and then The New York Times reported, three days after the attorney general released his propaganda document, Mueller wrote Barr to express his dismay. "The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office's work and conclusions," Mueller wrote, adding, "There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation."
Yes, and confusion was what Barr had in mind. The longer Mueller's findings were misrepresented, the more time Trump had to claim vindication, to denounce the media and -- well, to lie and to disfigure the results of inquiry that were in fact devastating about his conduct. Mueller's office did not take this calmly. It intervened the day after Barr issued his non-summary summary, and again with Mueller's letter.
Recovering from Barr's original sin is well-nigh impossible. Of course we now know what the report said. Congress can investigate, and the House can even impeach. But the political context for such decisions is irreparably warped. It will take enormous work to overcome that first impression that Barr so deviously created.
And anyone who still hopes that Republicans might have qualms about this massive cover-up was not watching Wednesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Barr testified. We have a president who was plainly elected with Russian help, and Republican senators want to go after FBI agents whose only transgression was to be worried about the intervention of a hostile power in our politics. They also want to reinvestigate -- Hillary Clinton! Most Republicans have locked away their consciences to appease a mob screaming, "Lock her up!"
When he answered questions from Democrats, Barr did everything he could to justify the resignation calls from Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and other Democrats. To trust Barr as anything but a specialist in smokescreens is now impossible.
It was Van Hollen who -- two weeks after Mueller had registered his complaint -- had asked Barr an un-senatorially direct question: "Did Bob Mueller support your conclusion?"
Barr replied: "I don't know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion."
Lawyers might argue over whether this was an outright lie, but to call Barr's answer misleading and obfuscatory is rather kind. Trump must have been very proud of his attorney general.
The obfuscation and indirection continued Wednesday when Democrats tried to pin Barr down on his prevarication.
When Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., pressed Barr about a misleading statement he made in response to an April 9 query similar to Van Hollen's from Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., Barr's answer was so convoluted that Whitehouse finally threw up his hands and earned a nomination for the quotation of the day: "I can't even follow that down the road. I mean, boy, that's a masterful hairsplitting."
The corruption Trump has fostered now goes to the top of the Justice Department. We have an attorney general who has proudly and shamelessly corrupted our political conversation to protect a president whose survival depends upon burying facts and clouding public understanding.

Not so fast on infrastructure improvement

Texto completo: If you felt the ground shake and witnessed wild beasts living together in harmony, that was actually a supernatural event triggered when Republicans and Democrats agree on something.
As I listened to NPR, in my car, to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) talk about his meeting with President Trump on infrastructure, I almost had to pull over. Schumer said, among other things, that Democrats and the president — yes, President Donald J. Trump — "want to get something done on infrastructure in a big and bold way." He said there was "good will" in the meeting.
I first checked the date. It wasn't April 1.
That left only two possibilities. The man I heard on the radio was an impostor. The real Schumer was in a closet somewhere, bound with duct tape and an ether rag stuffed in his mouth. Or that was really him on the radio, talking about how his meeting with Trump was very "constructive."
I suddenly felt lighter.
Could this be a sign that Republicans and Democrats realize they are failing the American people and have awakened, committed to a new sense of cooperation for the benefit of their constituents?
And what could be better than addressing our crumbling infrastructure - roads, bridges, the power grid, water supply? This is good government. Perhaps Congress can finally start doing something to turn that measly 20-percent approval rating around.
And then, like a frying pan in the face, reality arrived.
The infrastructure package would cost about $2 trillion. Neither the Democrats nor the president talked about how they were going to pay for it.
This, of course, is the tricky bit about wanting expensive things — the paying.
I would enjoy a snowmobile, an 80-inch TV and a pizza oven. But I really won't have them until I exchange currency for the items.
It's safe to assume that Trump and the Democrats will have vastly different ideas about how to fund infrastructure improvement.
Raising the gasoline tax, which hasn't been raised since 1993, has been talked about, but Trump is unlikely to go along with any sort of tax increase, no matter what's being taxed.
And the skeptic in me says that Republicans and Democrats, with an election looming in 2020, realize they need to at least pretend to want to get something accomplished so when the whole thing blows up they can say, "Hey, we gave it our best shot. It's their fault."
May 13 will mark the beginning of "Infrastructure Week." I figured I'd let you know in case you want to send a card.
Unfortunately, "Infrastructure Week" has taken its rightful place next to "National Unicorn Day" and Tinkerbell's birthday. You can celebrate all you want, but you're not going to see anything.
If there's one thing, just one, on which Republicans and Democrats should be able to come together, it's infrastructure. Maintaining sound roads and bridges, along with a stout power grid, is fundamental responsibility of our government.
Of course, doing things that are "fundamental" for which it is "responsible" is not a strength of this current iteration of Congress, nor has been the strength of several previous iterations.
And even with infrastructure, there are naysayers.
"We're in the middle of a constitutional crisis here," former Schumer aide Brian Fallon told the New York Times Tuesday. "The most important job the Democrats have right now is to uphold the rule of law against a president who thinks the law doesn't apply to him. We have bigger fish to fry than trying to look like we gave it a shot on infrastructure."
Buzzkill.
And there are plenty of distractions to keep both parties from focusing on infrastructure.
On the day of this writing, Senate Democrats are grilling Attorney General William Barr about what he said regarding the Mueller report before it was released. This Capitol Hill hearing featured all of the political classics — grandstanding, righteous indignation, raised voices, not to mention the call by Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono for Barr to resign.
So much for "good will."
I have that heavy feeling again. My optimism is about gone. And now I'm wondering if that shaky ground was really just the start of another sinkhole.

Texto completo: Publishers don't want Woody Allen memoir
Woody Allen shopped around a manuscript for his new memoir, but publishers didn't want anything to do with it.
A New York Times report detailed how executives at multiple publishing houses rejected Allen's memoir that he tried to sell late last year largely due to his increasing persona non grata status.
A-list actors, producers and publishers once flocked to Woody Allen projects, but the directing icon's reputation has suffered in the wake of the #MeToo movement. As greater attention has been paid to allegations of Allen molesting his daughter Dylan Farrow when she was 7, Hollywood has distanced itself from the auteur. Amazon has shelved his most recent film "A Rainy Day in New York" and several actors have either expressed regret over working with the director or vowed never to work with him again, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth, Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Timothee Chalamet.
According to the New York Times, some publishing executives described working with Allen as "toxic" in the #MeToo era.
In Europe, Allen's reputation is somewhat less tarnished, and he is in pre-production on a film with a Spanish producer.
Writer and longtime friend of Allen, Daphne Merkin, told the Times that Allen had been working on the memoir for a long time. "He's not one to set the record straight, but presumably, the memoir is his side of things," she said. "He's the kind of person who soldiers on, and someone whose work is his nutrient."

The 37-year-old tweeted she "may or may not have broken down in tears after the show from pain." Despite the pain, Clarkson performed her new song, "Broken & Beautiful," and opened the awards show with a medley of some of the year's biggest hits. Clarkson tweeted she's "feeling awesome" "#TheShowMustGoOn."

ABC said "mixed-ish" will be narrated by Tracee Ellis Ross, who stars in "black-ish" as the adult character with the nickname of Bow. In the spinoff, Bow (Arica Himmel) and her mixed-ethnicity family face the dilemma of assimilation or staying "true to themselves," according to ABC.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump telephoned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday for what both men described as a lengthy, positive conversation, in which they dismissed two years of investigations into Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential campaign as a "Russian Hoax" and a mountain that "ended up being a mouse."
Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after his first exchange with Mr. Putin since the release of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, which asserted that "the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion," Mr. Trump said he did not broach the threat of Russian interference in future elections with Mr. Putin.
Instead, the two leaders pledged to embark on a new era of cooperation on issues from North Korea to Venezuela, where Mr. Trump said the Russian leader "is not looking at all to get involved, other than he'd like to see something positive happen."
The timing of the call, two weeks after the release of the Mueller report, suggested a president eager to lift the cloud of the investigation from his dealings with Moscow and return to the policy of warmer relations with Russia that he once promised as a candidate. But it illustrated yet again the deep disconnect between Mr. Trump's personal treatment of Mr. Putin and his administration's more hard-edge relations with the Russian government.
Mr. Trump's dismissal of Russian election interference runs counter to the assessments of the nation's intelligence agencies, as well as Mr. Mueller's report, while his characterization of Mr. Putin's role in Venezuela contradicts the views of his own top advisers. They accuse Russia of propping up the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, in defiance of an American-led pressure campaign to force him from power.
On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, to warn him that his country's intervention in Venezuela was "destabilizing" for that country and for the United States-Russia relationship. Other officials portray Venezuela as a Cold War-like proxy battle between Washington and Moscow.
"This is our hemisphere -- it's not where the Russians ought to be interfering," the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said on Wednesday. "This is a mistake on their part. It's not going to lead to an improvement in relations."
But to judge by both what Mr. Trump said about the call and a statement issued by the Kremlin, he and Mr. Putin disagreed on little. They pledged to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuela. They vowed to boost trade between the United States and Russia. And they talked about a potential three-way deal on nuclear arms that could include China.
The agreement would be a successor to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a 1987 pact from which Mr. Trump announced he would withdraw the United States, largely because of evidence that Russia was cheating on it. On Friday, Mr. Trump said nothing about Russian violations, putting the emphasis on cooperation to "get rid of some of the tremendous firepower that we have right now."
Mr. Trump first mentioned that he "had a long and very good conversation" with Mr. Putin in a tweet, in which he also said that the subjects discussed included "even the 'Russian Hoax."' When the subject of the Mueller report and Russia's role in the election came up during the call, Mr. Trump later explained, Mr. Putin "actually sort of smiled when he said something to the effect that it started off as a mountain and ended up being a mouse. But he knew that because he knew there was no collusion whatsoever."
A White House official later clarified that it was not a video call; Mr. Trump meant to say that Mr. Putin had "laughed, chuckled" rather than smiled.
Mr. Putin has long denied that Russia interfered in the election, though he has been frank that he was rooting for Mr. Trump to win in 2016. Standing next to Mr. Trump in Helsinki, Finland, last July, he said, "Yes I did, yes I did, because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal."
The summary of the call released by the Kremlin said the "two heads of state expressed satisfaction with the businesslike and constructive nature of the conversation." But the statement also revealed a few potential fissures. On Venezuela, it condemned "outside interference in the country's internal affairs" and added that "attempts to change the government in Caracas by force undermine prospects for a political settlement of the crisis."
The statement also stressed the need to lift sanctions on North Korea in return for "good faith" moves to disarm its nuclear arsenal -- a step-by-step approach that Mr. Trump has resisted in his two meetings with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. He has pushed a deal in which the North would agree to give up all its weapons for a lifting of sanctions. But Mr. Putin, who met with Mr. Kim in Vladivostok, Russia, on April 25, appears to be positioning himself as a player in the nuclear negotiations.
Just hours after the call, North Korea launched several short-range projectiles, which followed the mid-April test of what Pyongyang called a "tactical guided weapon." The most recent move is likely to ratchet up tensions as Mr. Kim seeks a bargaining chip in talks with the United States.
Mr. Trump made no mention of his and Mr. Putin's differences over North Korea in describing the call, which lasted more than an hour. In the past, he has steadfastly avoided criticizing Mr. Putin, even when he authorized tough moves against Russia, like approving the sale of lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainian military for its battle against Russian-backed forces, or expelling 60 Russian diplomats to retaliate for Moscow's poisoning of a former spy on British soil.
"Getting along with Russia and China, getting along with all of them is a very good thing, not a bad thing," Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump has rarely mentioned Russia's role in the 2016 election, and when Kirstjen Nielsen, the recently departed secretary of homeland security, tried to convene a high-level meeting to discuss how to respond to potential meddling by Russia in the 2020 election, she was told by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, that it "wasn't a great subject and should be kept below his level."
Mr. Trump on Friday, as he has in the past, saved his vitriol for Mr. Mueller, complaining that the special counsel had wasted $ 35 million over two years and turned up no evidence of wrongdoing by him. He described his cooperation as unprecedented, turning over 1.4 million documents and allowing investigators to interview dozens of officials, including the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, for 30 hours.
"I didn't have to let him interview anybody," Mr. Trump said. "I didn't have to give any documents. I was totally transparent because I knew I did nothing wrong."
Mr. Trump also renewed his effort to turn the spotlight on the investigators, saying they spied on his campaign. He referred approvingly to an article published by The New York Times on Thursday that described how the F.B.I. sent a government investigator to London in September 2016 to meet with a Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, as part of the counterintelligence inquiry opened that summer to try to understand the ties between the campaign and Russia.
"That's a story bigger than Watergate, as far as I'm concerned," the president said.

Texto completo: Two months after HBO broadcast "Leaving Neverland," which detailed allegations of child molestation against Michael Jackson, a legal dispute between the cable channel and the Jackson estate has intensified, with HBO firing back over claims that it violated an old contract by showing the documentary.
As HBO prepared to broadcast the two-part film in early March, the estate petitioned a California state court to compel an arbitration proceeding. The estate pointed to a 1992 deal between Mr. Jackson and HBO for a concert film from Mr. Jackson's tour, in which HBO agreed that it "shall not make any disparaging remarks" about him.
The estate argued that the claims of abuse in "Leaving Neverland" violated that nondisparagement clause, and said it would seek $ 100 million in damages.
The legal questions involved may be esoteric, but they have drawn fiery comments from both sides. The dispute also highlights the film's potential to affect the estate's lucrative business selling music and drawing stage audiences in Las Vegas and, soon, on Broadway.
In a response filed in federal court on Thursday, lawyers for HBO called the estate's petition a "poorly disguised and legally barred posthumous defamation claim." They added that the film was protected by the First Amendment and that the 1992 contract had long since expired.
HBO's lawyers, Daniel M. Petrocelli and Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., added that the estate's suit "appears to be part of a transparent effort to bolster their publicity campaign against the documentary." They asked the judge, George H. Wu of United States District Court in Los Angeles, to deny the request for arbitration.
The Jackson estate has complained vociferously that it was given no opportunity to respond to the film's accusations, and sounded that note again on Friday. "HBO's opposition clearly shows that they are afraid to have this matter adjudicated because it will expose the falsity of the documentary," Bryan J. Freedman, a lawyer for the estate, said in a statement.
The estate was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt at the time of Mr. Jackson's death in 2009. Since then, it has transformed itself into a billion-dollar business, through the sales of Mr. Jackson's stakes in valuable song catalogs, as well as through a string of commercial deals, including a musical on Broadway, "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough," expected next year.
That musical has already drawn questions about how its esteemed creative team, the playwright Lynn Nottage and the choreographer Christopher Wheeldon, would deal with allegations of abuse involving Mr. Jackson. The issue was made murkier when the two told The New York Times last month that the two accusers in the film, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, "came across as very believable," as Ms. Nottage put it. Both she and Mr. Wheeldon said they did not see themselves as "judge and jury," about Mr. Jackson.
Last month, John Branca, a longtime lawyer for Mr. Jackson who is one of the executors of the estate, said at a panel discussion at Harvard Law School that "Leaving Neverland" had had a financial impact on the estate's business. He said the estate was considering legal action against Dan Reed, the director of the film, but gave no details about the legal grounds for such a suit; a dead person, for example, cannot be defamed under the law.
"Because the laws of defamation are what they are, there is nothing we can do or say," Mr. Branca was quoted as saying. "I'm going to suggest the law should be changed to protect the deceased at least for a period of time."

Texto completo: [Video: Adam Sandler's Return to SNL Gets Creepy Watch on YouTube.]
Adam Sandler hosts "Saturday Night Live" for the first time, and a follow-up special to "Surviving R. Kelly" airs on Lifetime.
What's on TV
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Before starring in comedies like "The Waterboy" and "Happy Gilmore," Adam Sandler was a writer and cast member on "Saturday Night Live" between 1990 and 1995. He returns to the show to host for the first time (and will possibly resurrect some beloved characters) alongside the musical guest Shawn Mendes.
SURVIVING R. KELLY: THE IMPACT 10 p.m. on Lifetime. The R&B singer R. Kelly has faced allegations of sexual abuse since 1996. He faced renewed scrutiny in 2017, after a series of investigated articles by BuzzFeed News detailed accusations that he was living with several young women and controlling their every move. Those reports led to the Lifetime documentary series "Surviving R. Kelly," which debuted in January and includes several women accusing the star of assault. Weeks later, the singer was charged with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four victims. This new special, hosted by the journalist Soledad O'Brien, looks at how the series has amplified survivors' stories and revisits the viral CBS interview between Kelly and Gayle King.
THE SHOP: UNINTERRUPTED 10 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms. LeBron James and the sports executive Maverick Carter invite Seth Rogen, Travis Scott and other big names in the entertainment industry to an intimate chat in a barber shop in a new episode of this unscripted series.
ALIEN NEWS DESK 11:30 p.m. on Syfy. The alien news anchors in this witty animated series cover global news with an out-of-this-world view: Drexx and Tuva, voiced by the comedian Will Forte and the "S.N.L." cast member Heidi Gardner, deliver the headlines from an extraterrestrial newsroom with curiosity and confusion. (One segment argues that humans have realized that cultural appropriation is not O.K., but we still commit robot appropriation with robot dances and Auto-Tune.) The first season wraps up with two back-to-back episodes that look at humanity's biggest threats and the shame of getting rebooted.
What's Streaming
THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. Early on in this thriller, it's clear that the title character -- a serial killer in Kentucky who's been dormant for more than a decade -- is none other than Don (Dylan McDermott), a father who often hides out in a creepy shed. When Don's son, Tyler (Charlie Plummer), discovers a disturbing photo in Don's truck, he does some more snooping with the help of his friend Kassi (Madisen Beaty), a self-described expert on the Clovehitch Killer. The suspense isn't driven by what they might find, but by its perspective: that of a son who slowly realizes his loving, ordinary father is a twisted murderer. The movie opened to mixed response, but in her New York Times review, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that "McDermott is admirably unsettling" and the "artfully sterile cinematography adds an air of suffocating wholesomeness that can make you squirm."

Texto completo: By E - The Environmental Magazine
From the Editors ofE -The Environmental Magazine
Dear EarthTalk: Do all the Democratic contenders for President in 2020 agree on the need to battle climate change? Which ones have demonstrated the most leadership on environmental issues? - Joe Bradley, Minneapolis, Minn.
There are 19 Democrats already declared as running for president in 2020 - Pete Buttigieg, Eric Swalwell, Tim Ryan, Kristen Gillibrand, Beto O'Rourke, John Hickenloop-er, Jay Inslee, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kama-la Harris, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, John Delaney, Wayne Messam, Marianne Williamson, Andrew Yang and Joe Biden.
Several more are likely to officially join the fray, and with them there is no shortage of ideas on ways to beat Donald Trump. Besides their common desire to unseat Trump, all of these White House hopefuls agree on the need to address climate change before it's too late.
A recent New York Times survey of the field found that each candidate favors bringing back Obama-era regulations designed to curb power plant and automotive emissions and curtail coal leasing on federal lands.
Likewise, all say the U.S. should recommit to the Paris climate agreement despite Trump's efforts to pull out. But less than half (Castro, Gabbard, Gillibrand, Hickenloop-er, Inslee, O'Rourke, Sanders, Warren and Williamson) are for even stronger new regulations to push us further faster on transitioning to a green economy.
Meanwhile, the non-profit 350 Action recently published the results of its 2020 Climate Test, a scorecard rating each candidate's climate cred based on whether they support the Green New Deal or similar legislation, have taken actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground, and have pledged to refuse campaign financing from petrochemical interests.
Gillibrand, Inslee, Sanders, Swalwell, Warren and Williamson scored 3/3 on the test, while Booker, Buttigieg, Gabbard and Yang each scored 2/3. (Delaney and Hickenlooper failed all three tests, despite acknowledging that climate change is a serious issue.)
Perhaps the candidate with the most climate skin in the game is Washington governor Jay Inslee, who has declared solving the climate crisis the primary focus of his White House bid.
His 2007 book Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy laid out a plan for solving the climate crisis via a rapid transition to renewable energy sources with massive investments in clean energy jobs that would benefit Americans from all walks of life -much like the Green New Deal proposal released earlier this year by New York Congress-woman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Harris, Booker, Gillibrand, Sanders and Warren each served as co-sponsors for the Green New Deal's introduction in the Senate.
Warren, a longtime sympathizer with environmental causes, recently released her plan to boost renewable energy production and protect public lands if she becomes president. The crux of her proposal calls for banning the extraction of fossil fuels on public lands (and off-shore in domestic waters) and replacing it with renewable energy production so as to meet 10 percent of the nation's overall electricity supply.
If any of the Democrats can take control of the White House in 2020, environmental advocates will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief.

Some touching John Havlicek tributes, and other items .&#xa0;.&#xa0;.

Texto completo: Picked-up pieces while wondering whether freedom fighter Bob Kraft will make another triumphant, crowd-rousing appearance at a Garden playoff game any time soon . . .
■ The death of John Havlicek inspired some amazing commentary on Twitter.
“It is getting difficult each time I hear about another contemporary that passes," Bill Russell wrote. “He was not just a teammate & a great guy, but he was family."
From Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: “I met John Havlicek at the same time & place that I met Red Auerbach and Bill Russell @ my high school gym in Autumn of 1961 — my freshman year. He was still playing when I entered the league and our friendship grew."
From Jack Nicklaus, who crossed paths with Havlicek at Ohio State from 1959-61, on Facebook: “John loved the outdoors, loved to fish, and frequently when he played golf at Bear Lakes Country Club in West Palm Beach, he carried a fishing pole in his bag. But if there is one thing we should all remember about John Havlicek, it is his heart. John always made himself available to help others. Every time there was a charity event, or any time someone could make a difference in someone else's life, John Havlicek was there."
Paul Pierce wrote about accepting the 2008 NBA championship hardware from Havlicek: “Will never forget you handing me that championship trophy and how emotional I was."
In an e-mail, former major league pitcher Jim Kaat wrote, “I was always flattered when people would pass me on the street and say, 'That's John Havlicek.' Hondo and I had a good laugh about that when we would meet.
“My favorite memory was when we were competing in a made-for-TV event for retired athletes. John and I were running the 100-yard dash against Drew Pearson and Alexis Arguello. We were so far behind we were carrying on a conversation with one another.
“What an all-around player and great all-around man."
Auerbach never saw Havlicek play at Ohio State, but according to Sports Museum curator Richard Johnson, Havlicek was selected by Auerbach “on the recommendation of sportscaster and college basketball player Curt Gowdy."
Havlicek was a three-sport star at Bridgeport (Ohio) High, where one of his basketball teammates was future baseball Hall of Famer Phil Niekro.
Finally, it you look closely at the Walter Iooss photo of “Havlicek Steals The Ball" that ran on the front page of the Globe the day after Hondo died, you can see the “Coming Events" sign on the old Garden's second balcony, and it includes 1965 Finals dates for Celtics vs. Lakers and a pitch for “Clay vs. Liston May 25."
That was the second Cassius Clay-Sonny Liston bout, which was eventually moved to Lewiston, Maine, after Clay (Muhammad Ali) suffered a hernia in the days before the fight was scheduled to be held in Boston.
■ Some of the Red Sox are scheduled to visit with President Trump Thursday at the White House. Manager Alex Cora has yet to say whether he'll go. I'm betting no.
Regarding attendance, nothing has changed since the Globe polled players during spring training. With the exception of Sandy Leon (Venezuelan) and J.D. Martinez (Cuban heritage, born and raised in southern Florida), all the players who have committed to going are white and all the players who have said they are not going are persons of color.
This would not seem to be a team bonding experience. Red Sox owners John Henry and Tom Werner said they are going.
■ It's downright hideous that the Patriots Hall of Fame committee annually produces a “final three" ballot without the name of Bill Parcells.
■ Very cool that the Mets' Noah Syndergaard hit a homer in his 1-0 win over the Reds Thursday. Providing the only run in his shutout win, Syndergaard joined the likes of Bob Welch, Juan Pizarro, Jim Bunning, Early Wynn, Spud Chandler, and Red Ruffing.
More impressive was Red Sox starter Earl Wilson hitting a homer in his 2-0 no-hitter against the Angels at Fenway in 1962.
■ Can everyone stop crying about NBA officiating? If the other team is taking more free throws than your team, it probably means the other team is working harder than your team. It does not mean the officials are out to get your team.
■ The James Harden-Scott Foster feud reminds me of Orioles manager Earl Weaver vs. umpire Ron Luciano in the 1970s.
Luciano regularly ejected Weaver, and the American League took him off Orioles games for a couple of seasons. When Luciano returned to work an Orioles game in Chicago in 1979, Weaver was ejected in Game 1 of a doubleheader, then announced he was protesting Game 2 because of the “integrity of the umpire."
Weaver was suspended three games by American League president Lee MacPhail.
■ Maybe Kraft can claim he was duped again. Like when he ran up the white flag in Deflategate or when he gave Aaron Hernandez the big contract.
■ According to the Patriots media cartel, they just had the best draft day since Auerbach came away with Hall of Famers Russell, Tommy Heinsohn, and K.C. Jones in 1956.
■ Speaking of good drafts, Theo Epstein gets too much credit most of the time, but still doesn't get enough credit for his last Red Sox draft in 2011. That was the year Theo and the minions got Mookie Betts, Jackie Bradley Jr., Matt Barnes, Blake Swihart, and Travis Shaw. Among current Sox, Theo also gets credit for Xander Bogaerts, Dustin Pedroia, Christian Vazquez, and Brandon Workman.
■ Speaking of JBJ, what does a guy have to do to drop out of the Sox lineup? Going into Friday night, Bradley was at .149 with an on-base percentage of .236 when the Sox mercifully inserted Tzu-Wei Lin — who is not an outfielder by trade — into the lineup in center.
Bradley, who banged into the center field fence twice Thursday night, had zero homers, 10 walks, and 32 strikeouts to that point. Where are Chris Young and Darnell McDonald when you need them? It was Lin's seventh career game in the outfield, his second start.
The Sox simply don't have anybody else and they don't want to use Martinez in the outfield regularly. So JBJ plays. Virtually every day. Regardless of his numbers. Bradley is a career .234 hitter. He'll be 30 next season.
■ QUIZ: What two National League teams have never had an MVP? (Answer below.)
■ Holy Cross is searching for a new athletic director.
■ There's a giant spoked “B" on the carpet in the middle of the Bruins dressing room, and the rug is guarded religiously by team staff to keep media nitwits from accidentally stepping on it when walking across the room. (Why not put the “B" on the ceiling, instead of the floor, some might ask?)
So why was MMA fighter Conor McGregor not shooed off the B when he gave his pep talk to the Bruins before a late-season game at the Garden? Check the video. McGregor walked all over the sacred spot.
■ Underrated spring baseball book is “Inside the Empire," a deep dive on the inner workings of today's Yankees by Bob Klapisch and Paul Solotaroff. You also want to check out “Son of Havana," by Luis Tiant with Saul Wisnia.
■ In March, the New York Times wrote a lengthy story on the Kraft family's Revolution ownership. The article noted that the Krafts spent $20 million to buy an e-sports team in 2018, adding, “The sardonic joke among some Revolution supporters is that now they're not even the neglected second child, but something even worse: the ignored middle child."
According to the Times, Bob and Jonathan Kraft declined to be interviewed for the story.
■ Folks in the athletic department at Boston College do not like 98.5 The Sports Hub.
■ The Joe Andruzzi Foundation raised more than $185,000 on Marathon Day this year. Jen Andruzzi, Joe's wife, ran in the race. The JAF has raised more than $6 million for families affected by cancer.
■ Quiz answer: Mets and Diamondbacks.

Texto completo: Fighting anti-Semitism
Last week, The New York Times printed a cartoon in its international edition that depicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dog being led on a leash by a blind President Donald Trump wearing a yarmulke.
The Times apologized for printing the cartoon, but just days later, the same newspaper that holds dear its motto, "All the news that's fit to print," ran another cartoon portraying a blind Netanyahu groping down Mount Sinai with a selfie stick. To the Times, this all makes sense in the paper's never-ending criticism of Israel and its leaders.
According to attorney and human rights advocate Alan Dershowitz, the reason "this is a big deal is because the cartoon is a sign of the times. Both in Europe and the United States, but especially in Europe, we see a dangerous phenomenon of increasing tolerance, of anti-Semitic tropes, images, and stereotypes so long as they are directed against Israel."
Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, former chief rabbi of the United Kingdom, explained on his visit to our museum that anti-Semitism is a "mutating virus that has now taken form as anti-Israel propaganda." Sacks' concern is that "this form of hate today presents a danger not just for Jews, but for all who care about our common humanity."
The shooting at a synagogue in a San Diego suburb last week is a reminder of how anti-Semitic threats can become a horrific reality. In this case -- as in other shootings of this nature -- white supremacy was unanimously condemned by both sides of the political aisle for the evil it perpetrated. But when anti-Semitism rears its ugly head in a mainstream newspaper like the New York Times or when Rep. Ilhan Omar tweets that support for Israel in Congress is "all about the Benjamins," there is a tendency to forgive and forget. Left or right, we need to be vigilant about anti-Semitism.
As an organization committed to fighting bigotry and hatred, the Illinois Holocaust Museum understands the dangers of unchecked anti-Semitism. We will continue to do our part in educating students, teachers and all our visitors, but eliminating hate will only happen when the media, political leaders on both sides of the aisle, and the community at large come together and learn from history's horrible mistakes.
-- Ken Cooper, vice president of development, and Kelley Szany, vice president of education and exhibitions, Illinois Holocaust Museum

Teach Holocaust
Just like other Americans, I was stunned, horrified and sickened by the events that took place at the Chabad of Poway on the final day of Passover this past Saturday. The rise of anti-Semitism in America is clearly concerning, and we cannot simply stand by and let it happen.
The shooting suspect is a 19-year-old man -- only a year out of high school and only two years older than I. How could somebody possibly exit our educational system with such a perverse worldview? One thing is clear: The education system has failed us.
Twenty-two percent of millennials have never heard of the Holocaust, and 66 percent of millennials do not know what Auschwitz is. How can we be surprised when some young people turn out to be vile anti-Semites when the educational system never taught them the history of persecution that the Jewish people have endured?
As a Jewish American, I have one message for those in power: fix it. Our straying away from teaching about historical horrors is frightening. We must reinstate and reinforce education combating anti-Semitism so that the next would-be shooter may choose a different path.
-- Jack Elbaum, Highland Park

Blaming DCFS
The brutal death of AJ Freund, allegedly at the hands of his mother and father, cannot simply be blamed on the failure of our child welfare system. The Department of Children and Family Services and law enforcement agencies become easy targets when such a tragedy occurs.
Prior to these agencies' involvement, were there not grandparents, other relatives, neighbors and friends who realized AJ's parents were unfit and unable to care for him and his brother? It is my hope that lawmakers are willing to help find solutions and not just make accusations regarding a "failed system."
-- Winnie Nyhus, Frankfort

Cuts hurt DCFS
The state keeps cutting funds to the Department of Children and Family Services, salaries are getting lower, caseloads are getting heavier -- and surprise, surprise! Children die. What do we expect?
-- Mona Stern, Gary

Murphy and Waltz seek FBI briefing on 2016 Russian hacking for entire Florida delegation

Texto completo: U.S. Reps. Stephanie Murphy and Michael Waltz have requested a classified FBI briefing for the Florida congressional delegation in the wake of what U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and the Mueller Report said was a successful intrusion of the state's elections systems by hackers just before the 2016 election.
On Tuesday, Murphy, D-Winter Park, and Waltz, R-St. Augustine, sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr seeking the briefing for all 27 members of Congress from Florida.
In a statement, Murphy said Florida voters "have the right to know the extent to which foreign actors may have breached our state's election security systems, and what the federal government is doing to prevent it from happening again."
Waltz said the FBI "needs to brief the Florida delegation on exactly what Russia did and which counties were involved so we can protect our elections and the voters."
Barr's office did not return a request for comment.
The redacted version of the Mueller Report released April 18 stated the FBI believes "at least one Florida county" was infiltrated with malicious software sent out by Russian intelligence agents. Rubio, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmedto the New York Times last week that there was a successful intrusion in 2016.
The hackers were "in a position" to change voter roll information, Rubio told the Times, but it didn't appear they did. Rubio would not disclose the source of the hacking attempts.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott say they are meeting with the FBI at some point this month to discuss the hacking. DeSantis and Secretary of State Laurel Lee have said the state had not been informed of the successful intrusion and still do not know which county was compromised.
Russian intelligence "spearphishing" emails sent to more than 120 Florida election office email accounts, which "enabled [them] to gain access to the network of at least one Florida county government," the Mueller Report states, "raises a host of critically important questions that require answers," Murphy and Waltz said.
"We look forward to working with you to arrange the briefing for the Florida delegation on mutually acceptable terms as swiftly as possible," they wrote.
The emails contained an attached Word document with malicious "Trojan" software that would have permitted Russian intelligence to access the infected computer. But none of the 52 Florida counties that had contracts with VR Systems, the Tallahassee company allegedly impersonated, has admitted to opening the Word document.
Volusia County elections supervisor Lisa Lewis said the office opened one of the infected emails in 2016, but not the infected attachment.
Broward County supervisor Peter Antonacci said this week the county received the email, but it was quarantined by anti-virus software and officials wouldn't have had the opportunity to open the attachment.
Orange, Osceola and Seminole county elections offices had no record of receiving any VR emails. In South Florida, Palm Beach County did not use VR Systems software in 2016 elections while Miami-Dade used VR systems for voter check-in and registration.

Texto completo: There were already roughly 20 Democrats seeking the party's presidential nomination, of whom all but a handful barely register in early polls.
On Thursday, Sen. Michael Bennet joined the fray. He's at least the 19th candidate, depending on who's counted, and the seventh U.S. senator in the race. He's not even the first Coloradan.
An understated moderate who was virtually unknown after a decade in Washington until an impassioned denunciation of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the 35-day government shutdown went viral in January, Bennet announced his candidacy on CBS' "This Morning."

"My plan is to run for president," Bennet said, acknowledging that he has a tough road ahead. "I don't think anybody has as broad a set of experiences in the field, and I think that will distinguish me."
The announcement just a couple of weeks after the senator underwent what he says was successful surgery for prostate cancer, follows Joe Biden's splashy entry into the race last week.
As support appears to be coalescing around the former vice president and a few others at the top of the field, Bennet has roughly a month to qualify for the first Democratic debate in June.
The donor network he's put together, largely from a stint as head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2014, may only go so far toward helping him meet the 65,000-donor threshold needed to earn a spot on the stage (he could also qualify if he gets to 1% in three polls).
Yet Bennet professes to be undaunted, saying he was impelled into the race, despite the long odds, by a long-simmering agitation with the toxicity of partisan politics.
"We have been tyrannized for the last 10 years by the Freedom Caucus," said Bennet, referencing the small but powerful group of Republican lawmakers that has often stood in the way of broader bipartisan compromises. He also criticized his own party, which he said "doesn't stand for very much at the national level."
He continued: "Our politics in Washington lack all imagination, and I think to keep going down the rathole with the people who keep dragging us down the rathole just is a fulfilling prophecy of failing as a republic."
A fiscal hawk in a flock of audacious progressives, Bennet flunks most of the policy litmus tests defining the early campaign: He opposes expanding the number of justices on the Supreme Court or scrapping Obamacare in favor of "Medicare for all" -- and is an unapologetic evangelist for legislative compromise.
He made those positions explicit in a launch video also released Thursday, offering himself as a "pragmatic idealist" frustrated with Congress' inaction on pressing issues.
"I'm not gonna say there's a simple solution to a problem if I don't believe there is one," he said. "You can't fix a broken Washington if you don't level with the American people."
He expanded on his vision and beliefs in a lengthy Medium post, urging citizens to move beyond a politics defined by partisanship and narrow interests.
A member of the bipartisan Gang of Eight that wrote comprehensive immigration reform legislation in 2013, Bennet is eager to go toe-to-toe with President Trump on his signature issue.
The 2013 immigration bill passed the Senate by a wide margin only to die in the GOP-controlled House after the leadership refused to bring it up. It would have created a 13-year path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally and would have devoted $40 billion to border security.
"Americans are really tired of the intransigence in Congress, the inability to do much of substance because partisanship seems like such a barrier -- that's what Michael is a response to," said Bill Ritter, the former Colorado governor who appointed Bennet to a vacant Senate seat in 2009. Bennet subsequently won a narrow full-term victory in 2010 and a more comfortable reelection in 2016.
"Michael's role as a thoughtful, persistent senator who has a real anchor in the substance of governing provides a narrative for him to run for president," Ritter said.
Translating his frustration with Congress into a platform for a presidential campaign is just one of the challenges facing the senator, who will compete for support in a crowded lane of moderates that includes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, and Bennet's fellow Coloradan and former boss, John Hickenlooper.
Bennet is certain to be one of the more literary contenders vying to take on a president who does not read. His mother was a librarian. His father ran National Public Radio. And his brother, James, is a former editor in chief of the Atlantic and now the editorial page editor for the New York Times.
In his Senate office, Bennet holds most meetings around a coffee table with piles of hardcover releases. He begins conversations by asking what others are reading. After meeting with donors and friends, he often follows up by sending books he has found inspiring.
"If you're looking for the complete opposite of Donald Trump, Michael Bennet is that guy," said Frank Luntz, the longtime pollster and political consultant.
Visiting voters in Iowa and New Hampshire in recent months, Bennet carried two books that he gave as thank-you gifts: "Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City," by Princeton sociologist Matthew Desmond, and "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom," by Yale historian David Blight.
Starting in June, Bennet potentially could pass out his own book, "The Land of Flickering Lights: Restoring America in an Age of Broken Politics."
A husband and father of three daughters, Bennet is the descendant of Holocaust survivors on his mother's side and Mayflower voyagers on his father's. He grew up in Washington, where his father was an aide to Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and attended the elite private prep school St. Albans, Wesleyan University and Yale Law School.
After moving to Denver, Bennet went to work for Phil Anschutz, the conservative billionaire, overseeing the reorganization and consolidation of a number of struggling corporations. He jumped into politics in 2003, serving as chief of staff to Hickenlooper, who was then the newly elected mayor of Denver.
His decade in the Senate has given him a reputation as a a straight-talking pragmatist that he hopes can now be parlayed into advancement.
"There's room for maneuvering, especially in these early states," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. "Sen. Bennet is obviously a thoughtful, authentic individual with clear views, and I think he has the potential to attract a following. For various reasons, a lot of these candidates do. I don't think anybody can predict who's going to attract a significant following and who's not."

Texto completo: When a trial attorney brags to the press about driving down the stock price of a company that continuously prevails in court, it’s time to ask some hard questions.
That’s how Mark Lanier, a Houston-based trial attorney, described the strategy behind his high-profile case built around health scares that do not square with the facts and the evidence. In a CNBC interview, Lanier acknowledged he was working to drive Johnson & Johnson’s stock down to “get their attention” and force a settlement.
Johnson & Johnson’s attention, however, is squarely on winning. In March, the multinational medical device and pharmaceutical company headquartered in New Jersey achieved its latest victory in a string of liability lawsuits when a jury delivered a unanimous verdict in its favor rejecting claims that its baby powder products cause cancer. Several other plaintiff awards have also been overturned on appeal, showing verdicts against the company generally don’t stick. Despite the courts repeatedly spurning the cases, the plaintiffs’ attorneys are pressing forward, hoping legal expenses and downward pressure on the company stock will achieve their aims. Even the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are now investigating the allegations.
A large body of independent scientific evidence debunks the central claims against the company and its cosmetic products — yet Johnson & Johnson has been targeted in almost 12,000 lawsuits nationwide, assisted by credulous reporting driven by a generic anticorporate narrative instead of a focus on sound science.
Both the New York Times and Reuters have adopted the plaintiffs’ attorneys' claim that company officials knew talc, a soft, naturally occurring mineral used in the baby powder products, was laced with cancer-causing asbestos. However, evidence cited in the reports shows the opposite: It appears that officials have gone to great lengths to keep baby powder free of contaminants.
Sadly, the press is now dug in. Studies from credible, independent organizations such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Food and Drug Administration, and others are largely unreported or only mentioned if a Johnson & Johnson spokesman cites them. Thus, the crowded field of authorities who exhaustively corroborate Johnson & Johnson’s defense are neutered as “studies cited by the company.”
For example, the Nurses’ Health Study sampled 78,630 women over a 24-year period and found talc users did not experience any increase in the rate of ovarian cancer regardless of how much they used the talc. The New York Times and Reuters downplayed these crucial findings as a “study cited by Johnson and Johnson,” giving more air to the assertions of the plaintiffs’ attorneys.
“Thousands of tests repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos,” Johnson & Johnson says on a fact page devoted to talc. “Our talc comes from ore sources confirmed to meet our stringent specifications. Not only do we and our suppliers routinely test to ensure our talc does not contain asbestos, our talc has also been tested and confirmed to be asbestos-free by a range of independent laboratories and universities, including the FDA, Harvard School of Public Health, and Mount Sinai Hospital.”
The company’s science-focused fact page does the work the reporters seem reluctant to do, adding context and science that are either omitted or distorted in the reporting.
The media would be wrong to take the company line and report it uncritically, but it does exactly that for the plaintiffs’ attorneys. Allowing courtroom histrionics to substitute for readily available scientific findings sets a disturbing precedent. High-powered attorneys want massive financial settlements, and the science only stands in their way. Litigation through the press is a viable workaround.
Lawsuits make lawyers rich, less so for plaintiffs. They can also drive media coverage. But they don’t always serve the public interest.

Trump says he won't nominate Stephen Moore to Fed

Texto completo: Conservative economic commentator and political activist Stephen Moore is no longer in consideration for a spot on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, President Trump said Thursday.
“Steve Moore, a great pro-growth economist and a truly fine person, has decided to withdraw from the Fed process,” President Trump tweeted. “Steve won the battle of ideas including Tax Cuts........and deregulation which have produced non-inflationary prosperity for all Americans. I’ve asked Steve to work with me toward future economic growth in our Country.”
Tweet
Moore, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, had told the Washington Examiner Wednesday that he wasn't dropping out of consideration for the nomination despite signs of weak support from Senate Republicans and that he had the backing of the president. He also said, though, that he would withdraw his nomination if its was going to be a difficult vote for lawmakers including Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who stated her opposition to Moore’s nomination earlier this week.
Moore's departure marks the second time in two weeks that Trump has had to abandon a pick for the Fed. Herman Cain, who ran in the 2012 Republican primary, also withdrew his nomination for the Fed board last month, after some Republican lawmakers said they wouldn’t vote for him.
Moore, in a letter to Trump Thursday provided to the Washington Examiner by his publicist, said that he was withdrawing because the "unrelenting attacks on my character have become untenable for me and my family and 3 more months of this would be too hard on us." He also said that he would continue to advocate for Trump's economic policies and that "Trumponomics has been VINDICATED."
Moore was a controversial nominee because of his lack of expertise relevant to the Fed and his history of partisan activism and his boosterism of Trump's favored policies for the Fed. He also drew criticism recently because of reports about unpaid taxes and child support and past comments made about women. For example, he advocated preventing women from participating in men’s sporting events because sports are "where men can take vacation from women."
"Here's the rule change I propose: No more women refs, no women announcers, no women beer venders, no women anything," he wrote for conservative magazine National Review in March 2002. "There is, of course, an exception to this rule. Women are permitted to participate, if and only if, they look like Bonnie Bernstein. The fact that Bonnie knows nothing about basketball is entirely irrelevant."
Moore was referring to journalist Bonnie Bernstein, who has been named one of the most accomplished female sportscasters in history by the American Sportscasters Association.
More recently, Moore made controversial comments at an event in November 2016 shortly after President Trump was elected.
“By the way, did you see, there’s that great cartoon going along? A New York Times headline: ‘First Thing Donald Trump Does As President Is Kick a Black Family Out of Public Housing,’ and it has Obama leaving the White House. I mean, I just love that one. Just a great one,” Moore said.
Moore, who said in a recent interview with “Firing Line With Margaret Hoover” that “there should be a statute of limitations on saying stupid things,” has apologized for the comments on several occasions.
“These articles you’re talking about were 17, 18 years ago. They were humor columns, but some of them weren’t funny, so I am apologetic,” Moore said in one interview with ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” last month.

Again, PSO solid when led by Lehninger The guest conductor returned Sunday for a program that included DvoÅ™Ã¡k's Ninth.

Texto completo: The Portland Symphony Orchestra has filled the time between Robert Moody's departure last May and the start of Eckart Preu's tenure in September with a season of guest conductors.
On Sunday, the visiting conductor was Marcelo Lehninger, a Brazilian-born conductor who now directs the Grand Rapids Symphony in Michigan.
Lehninger is not entirely a new face hereabouts. He conducted the Portland Symphony only two seasons ago in a program built around the Tchaikovsky Sixth Symphony. I remember Lehninger's Tchaikovsky as thoughtful and solidly played, if not necessarily revelatory, and that was largely my impression of his performance Sunday, when he conducted the DvorÃ¡k Ninth Symphony ("New World"), the Sibelius Violin Concerto, with Benjamin Beilman as the soloist, and a recent work by Kristin Kuster.
That may sound like faint praise, but revelatory performances are few and far between, and there's a lot to be said for thoughtful and solid. The most striking aspect of Lehninger's work, this time, was his adherence to brisk tempos, which enlivened the outer movements of the DvorÃ¡k, and made the folk- and spiritual-inspired themes sing.
For DvorÃ¡k, the Ninth Symphony was a souvenir of his visit to the United States, from 1892 to 1895, during which he was director of the National Conservatory of Music in America in New York City. But the work was also an object lesson for American composers hoping to create a distinctly American style.
In many ways, this Czech composer was the perfect composer to teach that lesson. Like many composers in countries outside Germany in the late 19thcentury, DvorÃ¡k was intent on breaking away from the dominant Germanic style and finding a national voice of his own. He believed that a country's musical soul could be found in its folk music, so just as he drew on Czech folk themes to develop his own musical accent, he counseled American composers to listen to American folk themes - the best of which, he argued, were African-American spirituals. (He also made a case for looking at Native American folklore, although his main influence in that realm was Longfellow's "Song of Hiawatha.")
You can hear a hint of "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" in the symphony, and other themes seem to emerge from the spiritual style, even if they don't directly quote specific melodies. The orchestra rendered these themes with an appealing shapeliness, and apart from an occasional lack of unity on chordal entrances, particularly in the slow movement, the players responded well to Lehninger, who found ways to offset the work's more attention-grabbing, energetic surfaces by lingering over the wistful currents that also run through the work.
In the Sibelius, Lehninger was a deferential, almost self-effacing accompanist, who left the spotlight almost entirely to Beilman, who played the piece brilliantly. Sibelius's score embraces extremes, and Beilman was clearly comfortable with them, producing a throaty, textured sound in more dramatic, combative sections, and an opulently silken tone in more ruminative or emotionally settled passages.
Lehninger opened the program with Kuster's "Moxie," an evocation of the feisty quality of spirit, not the medicinal-tasting New England soft drink. It was commissioned by Marin Alsop to celebrate the centenary of the orchestra she directs, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, in 2016. It is built of hard-driven, sharply accented, repeating rhythms that give it the character of a locomotive come to life in a burst of vibrant string and brass hues.
Not a lot happens in the piece, but it runs only six minutes - enough to announce itself and show off some an orchestra's energy and color, but not long enough to outlast its welcome.
The orchestra dedicated the concert to the memory of Debby Dabczynski, a cellist with the PSO for 44 years - from 1974 until last December - who died of cancer in March.

Texto completo: Michael J. Fox says he's on the difficult road to recovery a year after spinal cord surgery.
On Tuesday, The "Back to the Future" actor spoke to his friend Denis Leary at the Tribeca Film Festival about his mission to stay positive while living with Parkinson's Disease for nearly three decades.
In April 2018, Fox, 58, underwent a surgical procedure to correct a "recurring problem" with his spinal cord, which while unrelated to his Parkinson's, caused him to fall constantly. About a year later, he told the New York Times Magazine that if left untreated, the spinal cord issue would have led to diminished feeling in his legs and difficulty moving.
After the surgery, he had to go through an "intense amount" of physical therapy.

"It was a rough year and I fell a lot," Fox told Leary. "After I had the spinal surgery, I had to learn to walk again. I was really cocky about it and walking with no aids or cane.
"And then I shattered my humerus (upper arm bone), which is no (expletive) joke. Think about it," he joked.
At times, it was tough to find a silver lining.
"I got grim," Fox revealed. "I was the guy who made lemonade out of lemons but I was out of the (expletive) lemonade business. I couldn't do that. "
The "Family Ties" star was just 29 when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's in the early 1990s. Since then, he has become a leader in efforts to help Parkinson's patients and to find a cure for the degenerative neurological disorder, which can result in body tremors and muscle rigidity. He has been a leader in efforts to help Parkinson's patients and to find a cure through his Michael J. Fox Foundation, which turns 20 next year.
Fox admitted that staying upbeat can be a struggle – even for him, the guy other people with Parkinson's or related diseases like multiple sclerosis look up to.
"I feel like sometimes I don't want to be selling people the optimism thing because people have a tough time," Fox said, crediting his family for making things much easier. "Depression is real and things happen that I can't even comprehend. There are things that make my stuff seem like Band-Aids and skinned knees. People are out there dealing with real hard stuff, so I don't want to just be saying 'cheer up!' Some stuff sucks. "
Now, Fox is taking things "one step at a time" – mentally and literally.
"Each step is a new adventure," he said. "I might fall down, but I might not fall down. I might go this way, I might go backward. Who knows? That doesn't suck. That's all right. "

Time-Lapse Photography: Snapshots in 1951 and Today

Texto completo: The things we hold have changed, but the maneuvers are the same.
Take the figure facing the statue of Atlas: He peers upward, his elbow jutting out, his hand clasped around a camera. In one version of this image, he wears a blazer; in the other, a windbreaker, trilby and backpack.
When placed side-by-side, these photos -- and others, all shot 68 years apart -- resemble a trick mirror, changing black-and-white to color, suits to casualwear, film cameras to digital. Only the New York City backdrops -- Rockefeller Center, Central Park or St. Patrick's Cathedral -- remain largely static.
The black-and-white pictures were shot for The New York Times Magazine by the staff photographer Sam Falk on April 2, 1951. The color ones are by Tony Cenicola, a current Times staff photographer, and were shot on April 2, 2019 (in addition to April 1 and 3). Together, they form an entirely unscientific experiment that asks: What does amateur photography look like today versus 68 years ago?
When George Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak Company, introduced the Kodak #1 camera in 1888, photography became vastly more convenient. With a sale price of $ 25 (roughly $ 700 today), the camera was preloaded with a 100-frame roll of film. Once finished, the film and camera would be sent back to Kodak for developing. As one Kodak ad from 1889 put it, "Anybody can take photographs with the Kodak."
Eleven years later, the Brownie camera entered the market. At the far more affordable price of just $ 1, the Brownie could be used by anyone, to document anything. By the time of Mr. Falk's shoot, America's love affair with the snapshot was fixed. "At latest count there were more than 30,000,000 camera-users across the nation," read the accompanying article -- about 20 percent of Americans.
Today, more than 75 percent of the country owns a smartphone and, by default, a camera. More than 1.8 billion photos are uploaded to the internet each day, and a majority of those are taken on smartphones, our ubiquitous, demanding and irresistible companions. "It was odd," Mr. Cenicola said, "because there would be people with SLRs or point-and-shoot cameras taking pictures with their phone."
On a phone, images can be captured, assessed, edited, shared or discarded in an instant. The feverish, hopeful wait to pick up developed film that 1951 photographers would have experienced has disappeared. The joy -- or the disappointment -- at finally seeing a carefully planned photograph is now instantaneous.
But certain behaviors remain. When setting up his tripod, Mr. Cenicola noticed people not stepping in front of his camera, displaying an ingrained photographic courtesy. "I kept thinking: 'You are the picture. Don't worry. Just don't pay attention to me,"' he recalled. And in both sets of images, there are photographers who squint confusedly at viewfinders and contort their bodies to achieve the perfect angle.
"I love watching that sort of ballet, that dance, of taking a picture," Mr. Cenicola said. That is the universal here. Everyone is trying to capture a moment, a place, a group of friends, no matter how impossible the angle or how bright the light.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former FBI director James Comey claimed Wednesday that Attorney General William Barr and outgoing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein lack the "inner strength" to stand up against Donald Trump, adding that he believes the president "eats your soul in small bites. "
In a New York Times op-ed published Wednesday, the same day Barr is testifying on Capitol Hill for how he handled special counsel Robert Mueller's report of the Russia probe, Comey lays out how people in Trump's administration become "complicit" in the president's actions.
The former FBI director, who was fired by Trump nearly two years ago, praised Jim Mattis for resigning to stay true to his principals. The former Defense Secretary resigned after Trump announced he was going to pull troops from Syria. In his resignation letter, Mattis wrote that he was stepping down "because you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned" with Trump's own.
More: Attorney General Barr defends release, conclusions of special counsel's Russia report
"Amoral leaders have a way of revealing the character of those around them. Sometimes what they reveal is inspiring," Comey wrote of Mattis resignation.
However, Comey also added that "more often, proximity to an amoral leader reveals something depressing. "
"Accomplished people lacking inner strength can’t resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from," Comey wrote. "It takes character like Mr. Mattis’s to avoid the damage, because Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites. "
Comey in the op-ed criticized Rosenstein for his resignation letter, where he thanked Trump for "the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations," despite the fact the president often disparaged the Department of Justice and Rosenstein.
He also went after Barr for his recent actions echoing Trump by saying there was “no collusion” and claiming the FBI of “spying. ”
Barr has defended how he handled Mueller's probe into whether Russia colluded with Trump's campaign, which also widened to include possible obstruction of justice, despite a rare statement from Mueller on the eve of the attorney general's Capitol Hill hearing disputing Barr's characterization of the obstruction of justice portion of the report.
More: Mueller: Barr's summary of report did not capture 'context, nature, and substance' of Russia probe
Comey's op-ed is not the first time he has called out Trump's desire to have complete loyalty.
In his book "A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” Comey has characterized the president as a mob boss and described Trump as creating a "cocoon of alternative reality that he was busily wrapping around all of us. "
"His leadership is transactional, ego driven and about personal loyalty," Comey penned of the president in his book.
However, in Wednesday's op-ed, Comey warned that once those around the president begin "sitting silent while [Trump] lies," and start believing you are "you are too important for this nation to lose," that is when have lost your way.
"Of course, to stay, you must be seen as on his team, so you make further compromises. You use his language, praise his leadership, tout his commitment to values," Comey wrote.
"And then you are lost. He has eaten your soul," he concluded.

Texto completo: Demand better of media Well, the Mueller report is completed and The Washington Post, New York Times, Associated Press, Daily Herald and all Democrats are upset because the findings do not match the incorrect stories they have been publishing for the past almost three years. Now they are scrambling to cherry-pick bits, pieces and phrases from the report in an attempt to justify their false reporting.
The fact is that the report found 25 Russians and three companies were charged with trying to interfere with the 2016 presidential election without the assistance of any Americans. They also found that the Obama administration was aware of this back then but failed to do anything about it.
Perhaps this should have been reported as big news back then as well as now. Perhaps the headline on the Daily Herald Opinion page should be "We must do better" rather than "We must demand better." Our citizens need to demand better of the media.
Daryl G. Pratt Arlington Heights Disney’s executive compensation outrage Kudos to Abigail Disney for making herself heard regarding the compensation paid to Disney CEO Bob Iger.
When the new tax plan was passed giving big business huge tax breaks, it was supposed to enable corporations to raise the salaries of everyone working for them. Instead, some companies gave one-time bonuses, others gave small salary increases to those who kept the business running every day and used the money to provide more dividends for stockholders. When a CEO is paid over 1,000 times as much as the average employee, there is something wrong with our system.
How many millions does one person need to make to feed his ego, while employees struggle to hold their families together? Minimum wage is a farce. It’s time we took a good look at employee compensation, including company medical coverage.
Thank you, Ms. Disney, for having the courage to step forward on this issue. I think your grandfather would be proud.

Thomas: The exception that is Costa Rica

Texto completo: LIBERIA, Costa Rica -
In the ongoing U.S. debate about immigration, the Central American countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala are mainly in the news because many of those crossing our border from Mexico are from these nations. Why isn't Costa Rica experiencing a similar mass exodus?
I put the question to President Carlos Alvarado Quesada. In an email response he writes in part, "8 percent of our GDP is dedicated to education and our main resource is the human talent and well-being of the people who live in our country. Next Monday, for example, we will celebrate 150 years of primary education for free for all kids in the country."
Many of those fleeing other Central American countries claim to feel threatened by gangs and crime. Costa Rica has had a lower crime rate than others in the region, but that may be about to change.
According to the Costa Rica Star newspaper, the government and tourism industry started paying more attention to crime when "two female foreign tourists were killed in two days last year, and a third was raped a week later, all near Tortuguero National Park." The Costa Rican homicide rate has been rising steadily. There were 603 murders in 2017, although figures are lower than in other Central American countries.
Costa Rica is experiencing its own immigration challenge. The New York Times reported last September, "Since mid-April, when Nicaragua erupted in a violent political crisis that has left hundreds dead and crippled the economy, Nicaraguans have been leaving their country en masse - some fleeing a crackdown by President Daniel Ortega against his opponents, others - newly unemployed - desperately looking for work. Many thousands have headed to Costa Rica..."
In fact, writes QCostaRica.com, "Costa Rica has the highest percentage of immigrants in Central America, according to the study Labor Market and Social Policies, of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)."
Tourism is the main economic driver here. The government is concerned any perception it is unsafe to visit might cause serious financial harm.
The Heritage Foundation's 2018 economic freedom rankings place Costa Rica 61st under the category "moderately free," although President Alvarado references the Economist, which ranks his country "among the strongest 20 democracies in the world."
Not many people are leaving Costa Rica. It has the lowest emigration rate in Central America and one of the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean. And though the unemployment rate is 9.3 percent and about 20 percent of the population lives in poverty, Costa Ricans stay put.
Part of the reason may be a new anti-poverty program introduced by the previous president, Luis Guillermo Solis. Its goal is to pull at least 54,600 targeted families out of poverty. The plan combines previous welfare benefits that have been, reports the Tico Times, "distributed through 30 separate programs, administered by 20 different agencies." Families are to be assessed according to their needs and not a-one-size-fits-all formula.
How a small country like Costa Rica can affect the globe's naturally changing temperatures - especially when major polluters like China, India and, yes, the United States aren't doing much to reduce carbon emissions - is never addressed. For the left, intentions count, not results.
Crime control and maintaining a vibrant tourist industry seem to be better and more attainable goals than changing the climate and promoting same-sex marriage.

Texto completo: In Ruth Reichl's new memoir, "Save Me the Plums," the author and journalist recounts her 10 years as editor-in-chief of Gourmet. The magazine closed suddenly in 2009 after 68 years, a casualty of the Great Recession. In advance of her appearance in Chicago last week to promote the book, Reichl shared behind-the-scenes stories -- including the fight over recipes -- and what happened the last time she smoked marijuana.
Reporter's note: Full disclosure, I was a Gourmet Chicago correspondent, plus a fixer and host on the magazine's television series "Gourmet's Diary of a Foodie" on PBS.
The following has been edited for length and clarity.
Q: What is the meaning behind the title "Save Me the Plums"?
A: The title is taken from a poem by William Carlos Williams called "This Is Just to Say," which is not only my favorite poem, but one that is very well known by many food people. You say the word "plum" to a food person, and instantly they'll go, "I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox." It's become a meme on Twitter, where people will often paraphrase it for other things.
But beyond that, William Carlos Williams really exemplifies, in so many ways, everything I was trying to do with Gourmet magazine. He was a physician who spent a lot of time working with poor people. He was also a very ahead-of-his-time poet who was friends with Ezra Pound, (Ernest) Hemingway and all those people who went to Europe to be artists. So for me, he really exemplifies practicality and avant-garde sensibility. He was really excited about the life of the mind in literature. All of those things, I was trying to put into Gourmet when I took it over.
My father was also a book designer, and he not only designed the autobiography of William Carlos Williams, he won an AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts) 50 Books | 50 Covers award for it, which I've only just found out.
And then the job at Gourmet. It was a plum job. That's the other meaning. I have a very hard time coming up with titles. Every book I've ever written has had about 20 titles before it got to the real one. This was no exception. When I thought of it, it was suddenly "that's it!"
Q: Why did they close Gourmet?
A: Honestly, I don't understand it. At the point that they closed Gourmet, we had the highest circulation in the history of the magazine. But there's no question we were really desperate for ads in the last 18 months. Part of it was the strategy for advertising in Gourmet, which had always been luxury goods. As my former publisher explains in the book, "We're going to get hit harder than anyone else."
I knew from the first day that I went to Gourmet that I was going to write about it. From the first day there, I started printing out three or four emails every night before I left.
I was always certain it would all be over. Not that I thought they would close the magazine, but I really did I think I would get fired at some point, so I was trying very hard to keep a record. Every time I had a conversation with S.I. Newhouse (the late billionaire publisher of Gourmet), I went home and wrote it down.
Q: Why are there so few recipes in the book? I miss them, but I'm happy to see you adding some of the ones that didn't make it on your website.
A: It was not my choice. Nobody has told me that they miss the recipes. I miss the recipes. It was a fierce fight with my editor. She said she thought that they stopped the flow, so we thought we would weave in the ones that we felt were absolutely necessary. I think she was right.
Q: Will there be anywhere we can see you cooking online, maybe YouTube?
A: Nope. I don't have the facilities to go and make that. I guess I could have my son shoot. He is a film director. I'd never thought about that. This is a very good idea. I may get Nick to make a little documentary of me cooking a recipe or two. (Mutual laughter ensued.)
Q: Now that the book has been out, what's surprised you from readers?
A: If you look at the comments on The New York Times book review, I am surprised that there are still so many people who absolutely hated what I did with the magazine. I sort of thought they had gone away, but they are still very vocal. They are the people who loved the old Gourmet and absolutely hated what we did. I thought they'd gotten over it. They obviously haven't. They are still, 20 years later, furious about what we did to the magazine. It's fascinating to me. They must hate modern food media.
My editor just called to tell me I hit the Times' best-seller list, so I'm very chuffed about that.
Q: Given your Berkeley background, I've always wondered about your experiences with marijuana and food, especially now with the legalization movement.
A: Given my Berkeley background, it will probably shock you that I don't do well on marijuana. I freak out on it. I'm the only person I think I know who's my age, in my group, who never dropped acid. I was around a lot of people who did and saw a lot of bad trips. The few times I did smoke dope, I would eat until I was miserable, and that was when I had a good time with marijuana.
My husband, who has all kinds of chronic pain issues, smokes a lot of dope, does a lot of various CBD oils and stuff. When we were in California, he went to one of those MedMen places, where they have curated marijuana. They have ones they say will put you to sleep and mellow you out. They promised me "it will not freak you out in any way." I tell you, I took one toke of this thing, and I was completely freaked out. (More laughter ensued.)
Q: Oh, boy. So, what's next in terms of books?
A: I have two books left on this contract, but they are both novels. Then I have another nonfiction book that I want to write that has nothing to do with me; it's not a memoir. At this moment, I would say I'm probably not going to write any more memoirs. I mean, I am 71 years old. How far can I take this?

Three ways to stop the hate killings

Texto completo: The murder of Lori Kaye, a 60-year-old woman attending synagogue on Saturday, was the work of a domestic terrorist who killed her because she was Jewish. The shooter also wounded three others at the synagogue, who were celebrating the last day of Passover.
Terrorism is generally defined as an act of violence against civilians for political purposes by an individual or group. Saturday's assault at the San Diego-area synagogue by suspect John Earnest certainly fits that definition.
If this attack seems sickeningly familiar to many Americans, that's because it is.
Like school shooters, terrorists learn from and emulate other terrorists. According to what is believed to be the shooter's online manifesto, similar hate-filled terrorist attacks inspired his heinous act - including the October shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, in which a man armed with an assault rifle killed 11 worshipers. The shooter in that attack blamed Jews for the migrant caravan that was then moving through Mexico, according to his postings on social media.
In this manifesto, the shooter also references the man who killed 50 worshipers at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, last month.
According to local authorities, the California shooter was a "lone actor" terrorist who operated without the support of any group. He was also allegedly armed with an "AR-type assault weapon," which is designed to kill human beings at a rapid pace and is often the weapon of choice for mass murderers in the United States.
Jihadist terrorists, using semi-automatic rifles, have also carried out massacres in the United States in recent years. In 2016, armed with an assault rifle, Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando. He was inspired by ISIS - but had no direction or training from the terrorist organization.
A year earlier, armed with assault rifles, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 at an office in San Bernardino, California. They, too, were inspired by ISIS, but had no direct connections to the group.
What to do?
There are three kinds of issues that need to be addressed to respond to these cases of domestic terrorism.
The easy availability of assault rifles in the United States helps enable those intent on mass murder, yet the Second Amendment absolutism of the National Rifle Association (NRA) has prevented common sense measures to curtail the sale of such weapons, which are designed to kill as many human beings as possible.
Such measures do not amount to "taking" peoples' guns away. My in-laws in Louisiana do not go deer hunting with assault rifles.
However, the mood in the United States seems to be shifting - with the increasing frequency of mass murders enabled by semiautomatic weapons, contributions to the NRA are "lagging," according to the New York Times. And, according to Gallup polling released in October, six in ten Americans now support stricter gun laws.
Last month, the New Zealand government banned the sale of assault rifles shortly after the massacre at the mosque. Could the U.S. Congress ever enact such a sensible measure? The question, of course, is unfortunately almost entirely rhetorical, as long as politicians remain obedient to the NRA.
Another issue to address is the legal status of domestic terrorism, which is not a federal crime, according to Mary McCord, who ran the National Security Division at the Department of Justice until 2017, where she oversaw all terrorism investigations in the United States. The time has come to consider how such a statute might work.
Of course, there are First Amendment issues that make this complicated, but the case of Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Paul Hasson of Silver Spring, Maryland, underlines why such a statute could be useful. Hasson was arrested in February. Prosecutors said he had a hit list of Democratic politicians and anchors at CNN and MSNBC - and that he had assembled 15 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.
Yet a federal judge said Thursday that Hasson will be released while he is awaiting trial on weapons and drugs charges to which he has pleaded not guilty. - (CNN)

Texto completo: Either they don't know, don't show, or don't care about what's going on in the hood.
I was not yet 12 years old when Doughboy (Ice Cube) said those lines in the final scene of “Boyz n the Hood." But I was old enough to know the weight of his words.
John Singleton's 1991 debut film, a hip-hop California love song on the big screen, “Boyz n the Hood" was equal parts coming-of-age story and sociopolitical commentary.
Nine months later, when Los Angeles officers were acquitted for the brutal beating of Rodney King and riots broke out, Singleton's message resonated in ways that can never be dismissed as just entertainment.
“Boyz n the Hood" captured young black life in South Central Los Angeles and neighborhoods like it across the country. Whereas headlines do their best to demonize black people and justify their criminalization, Singleton showed our humanity.
He died Monday after his family took him off life support, having had a stroke earlier this month. He was only 51. But his legacy forever lives through his art.
Singleton knew what was going on in the hood. He grew up in those communities. Every film showed us the bittersweet beauty of black life and the freedom of imperfection. Singleton understood the power of representation and the justice served in nuance. He cared.
As the first black filmmaker nominated for best director at the Oscars (for “Boyz n the Hood" in 1992), he launched the acting careers of Tupac, Tyrese, Taraji P. Henson, and Ice Cube. He gave us Morris Chestnut and Cuba Gooding Jr. And though Laurence Fishburne's resume was already growing, Singleton wrote him as a cool sage — something that has become signature to his style.
He wrote roles that allowed Regina King and Janet Jackson to be more than a child actress and a pop singer, respectively. He saw them as stars. He knew rappers and singers were natural storytellers and helped them cross over into film.
Singleton had a hand in dozens of projects, the latest of which was “Snowfall," an FX series chronicling the government's role in the rise of crack in 1980s Los Angeles.
But his first three films laid the foundation for a lifetime on screen. By the time he was 27 years old, Singleton wrote and directed “Boyz n the Hood," “Poetic Justice," and “Higher Learning." I wasn't even 16 by the time I saw them all.
Decades later, the films still hold up as a slice of black American life. It was always by design. Singleton knew representation mattered.
“Over the years, people of various cultures, their voices were excluded from film and media," he told i-D magazine in 2016. “It was pretty much a white-dominated medium, so how is it when you don't see yourself onscreen? You feel invisible, you don't feel validated. The reason we have film and TV is the same reason cavemen drew on walls — to show who I am, I'm significant, I have a soul, I existed at a certain time. It's the same reason people make film — they want to get their stories onscreen, they want to validate their own existence."
Singleton showed us the danger black boys and men face in the country's most neglected, oppressed, impoverished, and violent neighborhoods with “Boyz n the Hood." He also showed us their spirit, brotherhood, and love.
His 1993 film “Poetic Justice" centered on the women in the community and what it means to love the men in the hood. Poet and hairdresser Justice (Janet Jackson) sees her boyfriend murdered. We see the isolating effects of Justice's grief and her fear to love again. We see romance grow with postal worker Lucky (Tupac). We see them as hard and soft, gritty and graceful. The duality is real.
Singleton's movies represented the depth of black love and also the tortured timelessness of black struggle.
We watched Justice witness the murder of her boyfriend more than 25 years ago. In our real world, Diamond Reynolds saw her boyfriend killed by a Minnesota police officer in 2016. She streamed it on Facebook Live. She fought for his humanity in his death. The world grieved when Nipsey Hussle was murdered last month. We watched his funeral at the Staples Center on TV and computer screens. But it's his girlfriend Lauren London who is living the nightmare of having the love of your life torn from you.
“Higher Learning" came out in 1995, long before the shootings at Virginia Tech and Parkland, and just four years before Columbine. It was more than 20 years before Tarana Burke started #MeToo. It was decades before white nationalists descended upon Charlottesville to rally for Robert E. Lee and white supremacy. It was 21 years before Colin Kaepernick first took the knee in protest of police brutality and oppression.
Yet “Higher Learning" foretold these moments. The film took place on the fictitious campus of Columbus University, where a freshman class gets a real world dose of racism, sexism, privilege, anti-queer attitudes, and classism.
Malik (Omar Epps) questions the fairness of a Christopher Columbus statue on campus. During a peace rally organized by rape survivor Kristen, a white nationalist opens fire, killing multiple students, including Malik's girlfriend Deja (Tyra Banks).
Throughout the film, you see how the police shut down the black parties and black protests, ask the black students for their IDs, and harass them even when they need help.
Fudge, played by Ice Cube, questions standing for the national anthem at football games.
Over the last few years, we've seen black students on campus profiled for eating while black, sleeping while black, walking while black, and more.
“Higher Learning" shows white students flip a car, have a wild frat party, commit a rape, and toss around homophobic and racist slurs without consequence. Singleton's film captured the struggle of the past, present, and future.
In 2017, neo-Nazis terrorized Charlottesville. Heather Heyer was murdered protesting their hate. President Trump still claims there were “very fine people on both sides."
Philadelphia Eagles fans rioted after the 2018 Super Bowl win. It was called a celebration.
Malik writes in a homework assignment that, just like Dred Scott did not win his freedom in 1857, he would not win his freedom today.
“A black man, no matter what his class status, would still have no rights that a white man by law would be bound to respect," he writes. “The result would be the same no matter what the law of the land states because it was not written by and for the benefit of African-Americans. The credo 'liberty and justice for all' is a falsehood that has been widely ignored and needs to be addressed."
The closing scene of “Higher Learning" is a shot of the American flag as the national anthem plays. The word “unlearn" is typed across it. Unlearn.
Singleton used movies to unteach the stereotypes that denigrate blackness. He wrote characters with layers that showed their imperfections without robbing them of their humanity. We don't have to be angels to have soul, to be written with love and given dignity, to deserve to exist.
With every film and show, he never forgot the black and the blue truth of the beauty of boys and girls in the hood.

THE PRESIDENT INSPIRES THOSE ON THE DARK SIDE

Texto completo: One day before a 19-year-old white nationalist opened fire on congregants of a San Diego synagogue, President Donald Trump preformed a bit of terrorist cosplay at the annual National Rifle Association convention in South Bend, Ind.
Without any regard for the sensitivities of the French or anyone else who appreciates morality in political debate, the president of the United States reenacted the 2015 Bataclan nightclub attack in Paris that claimed the lives of nearly 100 concertgoers.
Gesturing to the audience with his right hand and then his left as if wielding an invisible gun, Mr. Trump noted France's tough anti-gun laws and claimed that, if only a tiny percentage of the Bataclan crowd had been armed, the terrorists would have been stopped and fewer people killed.
"The shooting went on so long, and there wasn't a thing you could do about it," Mr. Trump said, while pantomiming one of the ISIS-affiliated gunmen.
"Get over here - boom!" he said, gesturing with an index finger. "Get over there - boom!" If this bit was supposed to elicit laughter the way it did last year at an NRA gathering, it failed. Perhaps NRA members in the midst of a civil war that threatens the viability of their organization were too numb to laugh.
After getting over the shock of watching an American president imitate mass murderers, one's thoughts turn to how anyone in the universe could ever mistake his clownishness for moral authority. He's not a fit example to anyone regarding anything.
Saturday morning, on the six-month anniversary of the Tree of Life massacre and the last day of Passover, a white nationalist strolled into the Chabad of Poway synagogue in suburban San Diego with a AR-15-style weapon.
After shooting and killing one female congregant who tried to protect the rabbi and shooting the rabbi in the hand, the murderer's gun jammed. He was then chased by a brave man, and shots followed the young killer as he drove away in a panic. He was taken alive by cops a few minutes later and gave up without a fight. Nazis are cowards after they lose the element of surprise.
A white nationalist and therefore part of the fastest-growing domestic terror group in the country, whether Mr. Trump acknowledges this or not, the killer posted his manifesto on an extremist website. He took credit for the synagogue attack as well as a recent unsolved arson attack on a mosque.
In his manifesto, the killer made clear his admiration for the anti-Semitic truck driver who killed 11 Jews at the Tree of Life and the white supremacist who recently killed 49 Muslims at a New Zealand mosque.
These racist man-babies and thousands like them who stick mostly to the shadows of the internet are feeling emboldened in a country where even the president is morally incapable of distinguishing between tiki-torch-bearing Nazis in Charlottesville and the anti-racist protestors who opposed them as they marched.
In the days leading up to the shooting at the synagogue, Mr. Trump doubled down on his description of some of the Charlottesville Nazis as being "fine people." He also reiterated his respect for Robert E. Lee, the traitorous Confederate general who turned the secessionist slave republic into a military machine ready to impose slavery throughout the country if the South won the war.
Mr. Trump's defenders insist that he's been consistent in his denunciation of Nazis, even though the Nazis themselves see him as an ideological ally and supporter of white supremacy. While they fault him for "allowing" his "beautiful Aryan daughter" to marry a Jew, they give him credit for helping to establish a moral tone in the country that makes religious violence and racial intolerance something even "fine people" can participate in.
The San Diego synagogue shooter began formulating his plan a month ago, according to his manifesto, so he wasn't inspired by any of Mr. Trump's recent praise of Robert E. Lee or the Lost Cause. He was more inspired by what he hasn't heard - overt hostility from the nation's leader to the values that made him strap on armor and storm a synagogue with a weapon of war. He has not heard Mr. Trump denounce the killer of Muslims in New Zealand.
He has heard the president refer to "s---hole countries" while insisting that America is "full" and can't accommodate any more migrants from Central or South America or any other region on the planet that produces refugees.
The president who pantomimes violence on the NRA stage would never endorse the shooting up of a synagogue, but he has racist supporters who believe his reluctance to denounce the white supremacist movement as consistently as he denounces Democrats or the Mueller probe or Muslims or Mexicans is all the dog-whistle encouragement they need.
Nazis such as the synagogue shooters in San Diego and Pittsburgh take the president's lack of words denouncing terrorism against "the other" seriously and his lack of morality literally. He has earned their support by his silence.

WeWork Cos. filed paperwork confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to hold an initial public offering, the company said in a statement. The New York-based co-working company said it initially filed in December and recently issued updated documents. The company, which refers to itself as We Co., likely would be the second-biggest U.S. IPO of the year after Uber Technologies Inc., which expects to start trading next week.
Labor Dept. says workers at a gig company are contractors
The Labor Department weighed in on a question whose answer could be worth billions of dollars to gig-economy companies: deciding that one company's workers were contractors, not employees. The letter provides further evidence that the Trump administration is departing from the approach of its predecessor on a key wage issue. Gig companies are assuming a more prominent role in the economy, and many are beginning to sell shares to the public.
Apple pulls parental control apps over privacy concerns
Apple said it removed several parental control apps from its store because of security and privacy concerns, issuing a rare public response to a media report that the iPhone maker was eliminating competition with its own tools. The New York Times reported Saturday that Apple had removed 11 of the 17 most popular programs that help users restrict features or the amount of time kids spend on devices.

Texto completo: ALBANY – President Donald Trump on Monday criticized New York's leaders for targeting the National Rifle Association, but also warned the group to "get its act together quickly."
On Twitter, Trump also continued to knock his home state, saying "People are fleeing New York State because of high taxes and yes, even oppression of sorts. They didn't even put up a fight against SALT – could have won."
Trump was referring to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's ongoing criticism of the federal tax reform approved in 2017 that limits state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, to $10,000 a year – a move that mainly hurts wealthy New York homeowners.
"So much litigation," Trump continued. "The NRA should leave and fight from the outside of this very difficult to deal with (unfair) State!"
Lawsuit against NRA in New York On Friday, Attorney General Letitia James's office confirmed it opened an investigation into the NRA's tax-exempt status.
On Saturday, the NRA's president Oliver North announced he would not serve a second term amid turmoil in the organization.
"The NRA is under siege by Cuomo and the New York State A.G., who are illegally using the State's legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization, & others," Trump said in the first of two tweets on the issue Monday morning.
"It must get its act together quickly, stop the internal fighting, & get back to GREATNESS - FAST!"
The New York Times reported that James sent letters to the NRA and its charitable foundation to preserve its financial records.
New York has jurisdiction over the NRA because it was chartered in the state in 1871.
NRA and New York The fight with the NRA is the latest in New York.
Cuomo's administration is looking to end an insurance policy run by the NRA, called "Carry Guard." The case is in court.
The Democratic governor has long fought with the NRA, and New York passed a series of gun-control laws in 2013 in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings.
Earlier this year, Cuomo and the Democratic-led legislature passed another round of gun laws, such as banning bump stocks and allow people to seek a court order to ban dangerous people from having guns.
On Monday, Cuomo responded to Trump's tweets by saying since the Newtown shootings, there have been 2,029 mass shootings in the nation.
Cuomo said that since Trump took office in 2017, there have been 74,600 gun-violence deaths, saying in a statement, "You have done nothing but tweet about it."
"The only thing illegal is the gun lobby's insurance scheme," Cuomo said. "Unlike you, President Trump, New York is not afraid to stand up to the NRA. I will continue to fight for the children of this state. As for the NRA, we'll remember them in our thoughts and prayers."
Trump and Cuomo Trump met with Cuomo at the White House in February to discuss the impact of the tax reforms on New York, but no resolution was reached.
Trump has repeatedly criticized his home state for its sagging upstate economy.
"I love those people," he said in February. "Those people are my voters. They've been treated very badly."
He added: "If New York isn't gonna treat them better, I would recommend they go to another state where they can get a great job."
New York Democrats, meanwhile, are fighting Trump on several fronts, including trying to get a law passed that would require the release of his state taxes to Congress.
Cuomo has been a regular critic of the Republican president, too.
"Nobody makes the anti-Trump case better than Trump. Just let Trump talk, and let Trump act, and let Trump divide," Cuomo said March 26 on WNYC radio.

Election Finance Reform Runs Smack Into Unions

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
As New York's progressive lawmakers fought a deadline last month to persuade the State Legislature to reduce the influence of money in politics, they hit an unexpected roadblock.
It was not opposition put up by billionaires or big corporations, but an 11th-hour warning issued by Mario Cilento, the president of the New York A.F.L.-C.I.O., an umbrella group of more than 3,000 affiliated unions.
"Now is not the time," Mr. Cilento said in a statement.
The last-minute opposition helped derail a push to introduce a small-donor matching system to state candidates; lawmakers ultimately agreed to allow a nine-member commission to decide later on a framework for public financing.
It also shocked some progressive activists and Democratic elected officials, many of whom have deeply forged alliances with big labor. But while unions are typically among the staunchest of Democratic allies, they also happen to be some of the biggest money players in New York politics.
The New York A.F.L.-C.I.O. and its affiliates have spent more than $ 3.9 million since the start of 2018 on state and local elections. The Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee alone took in more than $ 1.6 million from unions last cycle, or nearly half of its total haul, according to an analysis by The New York Times.
Unions have contributed at least $ 159,000, or about 40 percent, of donations to the political action committee of the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, since the start of 2018. They have also given more than $ 234,000 to the campaign account of the Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, in the same period -- about 30 percent of her donations.
The New York group's stance contrasts with the view of the national A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has endorsed H.R. 1, a sprawling bill pushed by congressional Democrats to expand public financing of campaigns in House and presidential races. (The bill stands little chance of passing the Senate.)
But New York has long been a stronghold for the labor movement, and its political voice here has remained powerful even as it has waned nationwide.
"We understand the sentiment for public financing, but we don't need that," Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents New York City teachers, said in an interview.
"It is not a priority," said Joseph Geiger, the executive secretary-treasurer of the New York City District Council of Carpenters, which spent $ 750,000 on campaigns last year, records showed.
In interviews with a dozen unions, only two -- Local 32BJ, which represents janitors, doormen and airport workers, and the local arm of the Communications Workers of America -- offered unqualified support for public financing. Two others were vocally opposed. The rest declined to comment, took no position or declared other matters to be of greater importance.
A public financing system would typically lower the maximum contribution to candidates, but then offer a generous matching-fund allotment. In New York City, for example, candidates can receive an eight-to-one match of public funds to small donations.
Those who favor such a system say it lessens the advantages of incumbency by reducing the impact of large donors. But for some of those large donors, including unions, that might be a reason to oppose it.
When the Supreme Court was considering the landmark Citizens United case, which found that government cannot ban corporate political spending, the national A.F.L.-C.I.O. filed a brief supporting corporations. The union argued that looser restrictions on political spending would help labor unions, although it later said that the ruling went too far and has urged the case be overturned.
In New York this year, when a coalition of activists fighting for campaign finance reform, which included the two supportive major unions, reached out to other unions to ask for their support, they were rebuffed, said a person familiar with the coalition's efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their projects with labor unions.
"If we're not there, then it would be slanted in a direction that is much different than the unions," Mr. Mulgrew said, adding that his union's donations counteract the influence of right-leaning groups.
The powerful health care union 1199 S.E.I.U. declined to comment on its position, as did other influential labor groups such as the Hotel Trades Council and the building trades union. The statewide teachers' union said it supported public financing "in principle" but not if it came at the expense of education and health care funding, according to a spokesman, Matt Hamilton.
Stuart Appelbaum, the head of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union, said he supported donation limits but had not been focused on the topic. "This is not my issue," he said. "This is not where I focus my energy, but I do know that political money corrupts the process."
Support for public financing could have created not just financial difficulties but also political ones: Powerful Assembly members, Mr. Heastie included, had expressed reservations about the idea.
Alison Hirsh, the political director of the Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which pushed for public financing, said union leaders must be cognizant of how their political decisions would affect their other priorities.
"Unions are different than community activists," she said. "Our No. 1 obligation is to raise standards at the workplace. There are a variety of ways leaders interpret that job."
The health care union, 1199, had signed a letter to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo supporting public financing in 2014, when Republican control of the State Senate made success unlikely. This year, with Democrats in charge of the Senate and Assembly, it did not weigh in.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., after its original appeal to lawmakers, said in a statement that it "had no position on this issue and that continues to be the case."
One of the most vocal labor unions opposing public financing, the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents state workers, centered its opposition on the program's projected $ 100 million yearly cost. Members wrote postcards and ran social media advertisements that urged lawmakers to think how else the money could be spent.
"We have way too many needs to be dedicating up to $ 100 million to pay for politicians to run for office," Fran Turner, the group's director of legislative and political action, said.
The union has donated more than $ 400,000 to state politicians since the start of 2018.
The $ 100 million price tag was cited by Mr. Heastie as a primary reason many Assembly members did not support public financing, though he said concerns about curbing union spending had not played a role. The speaker said, " $ 100 million is $ 100 million, and it has to come from somewhere."
But other powerful officials have pointed to the benefits that unions reap under the current campaign finance regime.
Mr. Cuomo -- who supports public financing and has received significant union backing -- has suggested that championing public financing while taking union money could be seen as hypocritical. He used the term "dark money" to refer to spending by union super PACs during a radio interview this month.
"I don't think there is any difference between Airbnb or 32BJ or charter schools," the governor, a Democrat, said of labor's super PAC spending at a news conference earlier this month.
A public financing system would not affect super PACs, which the Supreme Court granted significant leeway to spend freely on elections.
But union leaders -- both those who support public financing and those who are more skeptical -- say their political spending differs from that of corporations and other special interests because unions' spending represents the views of members, who contribute through dues.
"It's really small donors," Mr. Mulgrew said.
Ms. Hirsh said that distinction was precisely the reason to back public financing.
"We don't pass legislation because we can make a $ 5,000 contribution," she said. "We pass legislation because our members are engaged and involved in the legislative process."
Still, Democratic lawmakers have acknowledged the difficulty of disentangling donations from corporations -- verboten in reform circles -- from the labor union cash that they welcome with open arms. Unions may be a special interest, some argue, but they are a different sort of special interest.
That was the point Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz made at a rally outside his office in the Bronx last month. Advocates had gathered there to press him for support on public financing, decrying the influence of special interests in New York politics. He said he would support the proposal.
Still, he told them, "Not every nonindividual is a special interest."
"I get contributions from 1199, from 32BJ, and groups like that," he said of the health care and service workers' unions. "And to me, those are groups that represent my constituents. So, not every nonindividual is a special interest."

Doggone discourse better focused on real problems

Texto completo: Boy, is our political discourse going to the dogs.
The Washington Post reports Donald Trump is the first U.S. president in 100-plus years not to have a dog -- though others, including Ronald Reagan, didn't have dogs until their second terms.
During a February rally, reports The Post, Trump said "he doesn't have a dog because the idea of getting one seems 'phony' to him."
Using presidential pets to score political points is not without precedent. The Hill says "avid dog lover" Herbert Hoover was among the first to do so, while running for the nation's highest office.
"Following campaign advice, with hopes of shaping his image into something warmer and more charismatic, he released a photograph of himself with his German Shepherd, King Tut," says The Hill.
King Tut helped Hoover win the White House, but after he presided over the 1929 stock-market crash, Hoover was routed by FDR in the 1932 presidential election.
According to The Hill, some suggested Bill Clinton got Buddy, his beloved chocolate Labrador, to help his image at the peak of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Maybe so, but photos clearly show Clinton enjoyed Buddy's company.
George H.W. and Barbara Bush had Millie, an English springer spaniel who famously birthed six White House puppies. Millie's book was a huge seller. Their presidential son had a dog, too.
"President George W. Bush's Scottish terrier, Barney, became a celebrity in his own right, appearing in more than 10 films while he was at the White House," says The Hill.
The Obama family chose Portuguese water dogs Bo and Sunny, in part because Malia Obama required a hypoallergenic breed. The canines brought joy to the Obama family and were a delight at various White House events.
But no dog for the Trumps?
"Ever since President William McKinley's administration -- which began in 1897 -- every single occupant of the White House, save for Trump, has had a dog at some point," reports The Post.
Trump said he'd feel odd walking a dog on the White House lawn and just doesn't have the time to do so.
And that resulted in a loud negative response in some quarters that the current occupant of the White House loathes all things canine.
"WHY DOES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HATE DOGS?" asks Newsweek.
"Instead of having dogs, which tend to crave attention and often are scene stealers where photography is involved," Newsday columnist Anne McFeatters tells us, "Trump frequently calls women he disdains 'a dog.' "
In a New York Times column, Timothy Egan writes: "We know that Donald Trump, the first president without a pet since James K. Polk, appears to hate dogs."
The "Trump hates dogs" narrative got to such a point, it prompted fact-checking website Snopes to investigate whether Trump's critics are barking up the wrong tree.
Snopes' conclusion?
"The claim that he 'hates dogs' appears to be based on shaky logic ... and relatively scant evidence. ... It is also contradicted by photographic evidence and first-hand accounts of Trump's cheerful demeanor around dogs."
Like or dislike Trump -- goodness knows he evokes powerful passions among supporters and opponents alike -- it's troubling to me that so much ink and bandwidth would be spent on so trivial a subject, when so many matters of larger importance are begging for our attention.
Just another sign that our political discourse is going to the dogs.

Texto completo: Brian Stelter, a CNN anchor and former media reporter for the New York Times, roundly criticized his former employer Monday over its publication of an anti-Semitic cartoon.

“The New York Times is a great newspaper, I used to work there, but this is inexcusable. This was something that was straight out of Nazi propaganda,” Stelter said Monday.

“And the idea that any editor there, even some obscure editor in some far-flung office would see this and think it was appropriate is shocking,” Stelter continued. “The Times needs to be held accountable on this.”

The cartoon in question was published Thursday and portrayed President Trump wearing a yarmulke and being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is depicted as a service dog for the blind on a leash with a Star of David collar.

The Times initially responded to backlash over the cartoon by saying its publication was “an error in judgment.” But then issued a more thorough apology Sunday noting that the decision to publish it came from a single editor and that there would be “significant changes.”

“We are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again,” the Sunday statement said. “Such imagery is always dangerous, and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, it’s all the more unacceptable.”

Texto completo: As prejudices go, anti-Semitism can sometimes be hard to pin down, but on Thursday the opinion pages of The New York Times international edition provided a textbook illustration of it.
Except that The Times wasn't explaining anti-Semitism. It was purveying it.
It did so in the form of a cartoon, provided to the newspaper by a wire service and published directly above an unrelated column by Tom Friedman, in which a guide dog with a prideful countenance and the face of Benjamin Netanyahu leads a blind, fat Donald Trump wearing dark glasses and a black yarmulke. Lest there be any doubt as to the identity of the dog-man, it wears a collar from which hangs a Star of David.
Here was an image that, in another age, might have been published in the pages of Der Stürmer. The Jew in the form of a dog. The small but wily Jew leading the dumb and trusting American. The hated Trump being Judaized with a skullcap. The nominal servant acting as the true master. The cartoon checked so many anti-Semitic boxes that the only thing missing was a dollar sign.
The image also had an obvious political message: Namely, that in the current administration, the United States follows wherever Israel wants to go. This is false -- consider Israel's horrified reaction to Trump's announcement last year that he intended to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria -- but it's beside the point. There are legitimate ways to criticize Trump's approach to Israel, in pictures as well as words. But there was nothing legitimate about this cartoon.
So what was it doing in The Times?
For some Times readers -- or, as often, former readers -- the answer is clear: The Times has a longstanding Jewish problem, dating back to World War II, when it mostly buried news about the Holocaust, and continuing into the present day in the form of intensely adversarial coverage of Israel. The criticism goes double when it comes to the editorial pages, whose overall approach toward the Jewish state tends to range, with some notable exceptions, from tut-tutting disappointment to thunderous condemnation.
For these readers, the cartoon would have come like the slip of the tongue that reveals the deeper institutional prejudice. What was long suspected is, at last, revealed.
The real story is a bit different, though not in ways that acquit The Times. The cartoon appeared in the print version of the international edition, which has a limited overseas circulation, a much smaller staff, and far less oversight than the regular edition. Incredibly, the cartoon itself was selected and seen by just one midlevel editor right before the paper went to press.
An initial editor's note acknowledged that the cartoon "included anti-Semitic tropes," "was offensive," and that "it was an error of judgment to publish it." On Sunday, The Times issued an additional statement saying it was "deeply sorry" for the cartoon and that "significant changes" would be made in terms of internal processes and training.
In other words, the paper's position is that it is guilty of a serious screw-up but not a cardinal sin. Not quite.
The problem with the cartoon isn't that its publication was a willful act of anti-Semitism. It wasn't. The problem is that its publication was an astonishing act of ignorance of anti-Semitism -- and that, at a publication that is otherwise hyper-alert to nearly every conceivable expression of prejudice, from mansplaining to racial microaggressions to transphobia.
Imagine, for instance, if the dog on a leash in the image hadn't been the Israeli prime minister but instead a prominent woman such as Nancy Pelosi, a person of color such as John Lewis, or a Muslim such as Ilhan Omar. Would that have gone unnoticed by either the wire service that provides the Times with images or the editor who, even if he were working in haste, selected it?
The question answers itself. And it raises a follow-on: How have even the most blatant expressions of anti-Semitism become almost undetectable to editors who think it's part of their job to stand up to bigotry?
The reason is the almost torrential criticism of Israel and the mainstreaming of anti-Zionism, including by this paper, which has become so common that people have been desensitized to its inherent bigotry. So long as anti-Semitic arguments or images are framed, however speciously, as commentary about Israel, there will be a tendency to view them as a form of political opinion, not ethnic prejudice. But as I noted in a Sunday Review essay in February, anti-Zionism is all but indistinguishable from anti-Semitism in practice and often in intent, however much progressives try to deny this.
Add to the mix the media's routine demonization of Netanyahu, and it is easy to see how the cartoon came to be drawn and published: Already depicted as a malevolent Jewish leader, it's just a short step to depict him as a malevolent Jew.
I'm writing this column conscious of the fact that it is unusually critical of the newspaper in which it appears, and it is a credit to the paper that it is publishing it. I have now been with The Times for two years and I'm certain that the charge that the institution is in any way anti-Semitic is a calumny.
But the publication of the cartoon isn't just an "error of judgment," either. The paper owes the Israeli prime minister an apology. It owes itself some serious reflection as to how it came to publish that cartoon -- and how its publication came, to many longtime readers, as a shock but not a surprise.
The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips . And here's our email: letters@nytimes.com .

Texto completo: James Holzhauer has dominated "Jeopardy!" like no one else since the current version of the television game show had its premiere in 1984. He won again on the episode that aired Wednesday, pushing his total earnings above $ 1.1 million, second on the all-time list behind the legendary Ken Jennings.
And the remarkable thing is that Holzhauer, a 34-year-old professional sports bettor from Las Vegas, has reached that mark in just 15 games; Jennings's $ 2.5 million came in 74 games.
Holzhauer is extraordinarily knowledgeable, of course, but his huge scores -- he now holds the top seven best daily totals in "Jeopardy!" history -- come largely because of his aggressive strategy. He seeks out the high value questions first, and when he finds a Daily Double, which allows contestants to bet as much of their winnings as they like, he bets big.
His enormous winnings and vast margins of victory almost give the impression that he has broken the game.
Holzhauer spoke to The New York Times about his "Jeopardy!" strategy, betting on sports and his secret weapon for learning trivia. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.
Your strategy on "Jeopardy!" has drawn a lot of attention.
You could make an analogy to sports betting or poker tournaments. There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament. You can make plays that other people can't.
When I was just getting started in sports, I didn't have a huge bankroll, and there were times when I would see a good betting opportunity and didn't have enough to put down on it.
Hitting a Daily Double on the first clue is nice I guess, but you can do a lot more damage if you have $ 5,000 in front of you already.
Did you plan this strategy from the beginning, or did it develop as you went along?
I definitely had the idea right away. You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game I'm going for the $ 1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity.
I think the only time I ever deviated from it was a category about the U.S. Senate. I'm not a politics guy, so I avoided that, but other than that I'm going $ 1,000-1,000-1,000 whenever I can.
Why doesn't everyone come out and bet very aggressively?
You have to be comfortable. Some of the opponents I've been playing, you can see they are visibly shaken by what's going on onstage. Of course, you're not going to play well if you're up there trembling. And if you make yourself tremble by playing more aggressively than you are comfortable with, that's so much the worse.
No. 1 is making sure you're in your comfort zone. My comfort zone is very different than the typical contestant. I think that's a huge advantage for me.
Would you describe the traditional way of playing "Jeopardy!" as overly risk-averse?
I would definitely say it's too risk-averse. The funny thing is, my strategy actually minimizes the risk of me losing a game. There's times in a football game where a team goes for a big TD pass. If you don't take a risk like that, you're not going to win. Really, the big risk is never trying anything that looks like a big gamble.
Is sports betting your full-time job?
My source of income is sports betting. I have some investments also.
What sports do you focus on?
When I started 14 years ago, the biggest edges were in baseball, and that's what I focused on. But the market's really caught up with advanced statistics, and they take bigger bets on games like football and basketball, so I'm focusing more of my attention there. Hockey I've been trying to work on lately. You can find some inefficiencies in team totals [how many goals will be scored in a game] and the puck line [betting that a team will win by a certain margin].
Did you bet on the Sharks-Golden Knights game? [The San Jose Sharks came from 3-0 down to eliminate the Vegas Golden Knights from the hockey playoffs on Tuesday.]
I didn't, but I was already annoyed enough as a fan.
Do you have one thing you bet on where you've found an edge, or do you jump around?
I certainly do jump around. When I got started, I found one thing in the baseball futures markets, where long shots were priced incorrectly. They have completely closed that loophole now. These things just disappear overnight. When one sports book manager figures out what you're doing, he adjusts his odds, and the whole rest of the market follows.
Some professional sports gamblers have been barred from betting at certain casinos because they win too much. Has that happened to you?
About half the sports books in town won't take a bet from me. You hope you retain a good relationship with the other half. The other half know I'm a pro, too. I can't bet as much as a random guy off the street at those places, but they're willing to take some action from me, at least.
How does being a professional sports bettor connect with the strategy you developed for "Jeopardy!"?
There's a few things. The fact that I win and lose money all the time helps desensitize me, so I can write down $ 60,000 as the Final Jeopardy wager and not be trembling at the thought of losing that money.
And thinking: "This isn't a trivia question. It's a coin flip that's going to land heads for me a lot more often than it's going to land tails, so I'm going to bet as much as I can on heads."
What is the right balance for being successful at "Jeopardy!", between strategy, knowledge of trivia and using the buzzer?
If someone coming off the streets wants to win "Jeopardy!", the first step is knowing enough trivia to get on.
But the people onstage have been preselected. They all passed the same test. Some people know a little bit more, but everyone up there can get most of the questions right.
Then the buzzer becomes the biggest factor. Maybe a 60-20-20 breakdown.
How did you learn so many facts? What was your education?
I went to Illinois. Most people think I went to Princeton or something. But I was never a diligent student.
I have a strategy of reading children's books to gain knowledge. I've found that in an adult reference book, if it's not a subject I'm interested in, I just can't get into it.
I was thinking, what is the place in the library I can go to to get books tailored to make things interesting for uninterested readers? Boom. The children's section.
Getting onto "Jeopardy!" was a pet project my whole life, so it was something I was willing to work really hard on.
How has this run of success changed your life?
I'm still in my normal life now. If the right opportunity comes along I would of course consider it, but if I get to a point where I can't drive my own kid to class, then I think I've really screwed up. I want to not lose what makes me be me.
Photograph With winnings of close to $ 1.3 million, James Holzhauer is second on the all-time list of "Jeopardy!" earners -- for now. "You have to be comfortable," he said. "Some of the opponents I've been playing, you can see they are visibly shaken." (PHOTOGRAPH BY CAROL KAELSON/JEOPARDY PRODUCTIONS, VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS) (C6)

Social media blackout sets ‘troubling precedent'

Texto completo: The social media blackout that Sri Lanka imposed in the aftermath of the Easter Sunday bombings that killed more than 300 people illustrated the dwindling confidence of governments around the world that Silicon Valley can effectively combat the misuse of social media by terrorists.

Free speech activists are troubled not just by the blackout itself but by the lack of any public outcry in response, said Ivan Sigal, executive director of Global Voices, an advocacy group that favors free speech on digital platforms.

"That this is happening and there's not outrage, because there's neither trust in platforms nor trust in government, is a point of failure all around," Sigal told the Washington Examiner . "It's a telling moment, this idea that it's an acceptable approach to public security to shut the media down."

The decision by the Sri Lankan government, which affected platforms including Facebook and photo-sharing site Instagram, was an attempt to prevent confusion and further violence from false reports that were spreading rapidly in the aftermath of the explosions, according to officials in the capital city Colombo.

In March, livestreamed attacks in New Zealand killed 50 people at two mosques, prompting scrutiny of how social media platforms can be exploited by terrorists to give anyone with a smartphone access to an audience of billions. With violent attacks increasing in frequency even in developed countries, calls to regulate the internet have also grown.

"We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told her country's Parliament a day after the mosque shootings. "They are the publisher, not just the postman."

Australia, where the suspect in that case lived, has called on the G-20 nations to consider new rules for social media at its meeting in Japan this year. In the U.S., the House Homeland Security Committee summoned executives of Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft to Washington to explain their handling of the matter.

British Prime Minister Theresa May's government, meanwhile, has proposed establishing a new internet regulator and imposing a so-called duty of care on digital platforms to block harmful content. Enforcement powers would include not only levying fines but possible criminal prosecution of individual senior managers.

"There definitely is a degradation of trust," Sigal said.

The government of Sri Lanka, a nation of 22 million still recovering from a 25-year civil war that ended in 2009, bears some responsibility for failing to proactively address tensions that might have rendered the blackout unnecessary, he added.

At Facebook, teams from across the company "have been working to support first responders and law enforcement as well as to identify and remove content which violates our standards," a spokeswoman said after the Easter slayings. "Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this horrendous act."

Facebook's policies ban anything that "glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of others," including images that show visible internal organs and charred or burning people, founder Mark Zuckerberg has said. Last year, the company dedicated a team of people to identify and delete content that promoted violence against Muslims in Myanmar, though it was criticized for acting too slowly.

Social media plays a significant role in the proliferation of hate speech in that country, according to a 2018 report prepared for the Human Rights Council of the United Nations that faulted the government of Myanmar for allowing such behavior to thrive.

"Facebook has been a useful instrument for those seeking to spread hate, in a context where, for most users, Facebook is the Internet," the council's fact-finding mission concluded. "The extent to which Facebook posts and messages have led to real-world discrimination and violence must be independently and thoroughly examined."

Zuckerberg, for his part, conceded in a Washington Post op-ed in late March that the time has come for increased government regulation of the internet, suggesting that four areas should be prioritized, including harmful content.

"We have a responsibility to keep people safe on our services," he wrote. "That means deciding what counts as terrorist propaganda, hate speech and more."

Noting that lawmakers have told him repeatedly, including during congressional hearings, that Facebook has "too much power over speech," Zuckerberg said he agrees. "I've come to believe that we shouldn’t make so many important decisions about speech on our own."

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says he's open to "regulation where it makes sense," noting that the San Francisco-based company has focused on proactive removal of content that violates its policies, which prohibit criminal activity and hate speech.

"Of all the tweets we take down every week for abusive content, 38% of them are now proactively detected by our machine learning models," Dorsey explained. "This is a huge step, as there was 0% just a year ago."

Twitter has been "focusing a lot of our work on making sure that we recognize that everything that happens online has off-line ramifications, and protect someone’s physical safety above all else," he added.

Use of the platforms by white nationalists has been a particular concern. In April, the House Judiciary Committee questioned representatives of both Google and Facebook on their efforts to combat supremacist rhetoric, which Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said was linked to extremist attacks, including the one in New Zealand.

"In the age of instant communication with worldwide reach, white nationalists target communities of color and religious minorities through social media platforms, some of which are well-known to all Americans and some of which operate in hidden corners of the web," he said. "These platforms are utilized as conduits to spread vitriolic hate messages into every home and country."

Such developments are the reason Kara Swisher says her first thought after learning of Sri Lanka's decision was that it was a wise move.

"It pains me as a journalist, and someone who once believed that a worldwide communications medium would herald more tolerance, to admit this — to say that my first instinct was to turn it all off," she wrote in a New York Times column. "But it has become clear to me with every incident that the greatest experiment in human interaction in the history of the world continues to fail in ever more dangerous ways."

Sigal worries such reactions might grow more widespread, prompting governments in other countries to try tactics like Sri Lanka's, especially in nations that lack free speech protections such as the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment.

"Blocks like that tend to decrease trust in government, and they create spaces for silence and power imbalances in who has access to media," he said. "It's a highly problematic approach."

Texto completo: My phone rang. It was Hedrick Smith.
That’s a big name to an old news scribbler like me. Smith was a two-time Pulitzer winner with the New York Times, who covered the Cold War (from the Soviet Union), the Vietnam War, the Pentagon Papers, and other small matters.
More recently, he’s worked on books and documentaries, many of them big hits, including “Who Stole the American Dream” in 2012. Now he’s an activist, with an organization called “Reclaim the American Dream” that wants to fix our democracy.
He’s coming to Minnesota next week to work on that. A local friend of his had recruited me to cover some of Smith’s Twin Cities events. I was interested, but had a few questions. I was expected some emails with details of the events but the phone rang and it was Smith.
He is 85, he told me within a few minutes, and “not interested in wasting time.” He said he wanted to “speed this up,” meaning, I guess, get me committed and revved up about his visit and his cause. Things did speed up.
We quickly established that we both think the Electoral College is an undemocratic relic of the framing era that has become worse with developments over the decades, like the winner-take-all nature of electoral votes in 48 of the 50 states, which creates negative incentives for presidential campaigns, like focusing overmuch on a few “swing states,” and creating the possibility (currently, a reality) of having a president who received neither a majority nor a plurality of the overall popular vote.
Smith favors the Electoral College workaround called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, under which enough states with enough electoral votes would commit to give its E-votes to whichever presidential candidate won the overall national popular vote. I told him I favor it too, and have written about it, but that I had the impression the campaign for it had stalled for lack of new states getting on board and was well short of the number of state and electoral votes needed to make it work.
He told me I was wrong. That several states had recently joined the compact. I hadn’t noticed but I checked and that was true. After four years of no progress, four new states had joined the compact in 2018-19, but they are small states, bringing the total of votes in states that have joined to 189 (according to the NPV site.) But it takes 270. (Minnesota has not joined the compact, but a bill to do so comes up in every sessions. Currently it’s part of House File 1603, which is an omnibus bill on election related matters.)
Smith claims there are several more states edging close to joining. I’m skeptical. That dynamic kept occurring. Smith sees things happening, with significant potential to change our democracy for the better, to strengthen its weaknesses. Why should I cling to my skepticism when he is trying to do something?
Smith favors Ranked Choice Voting (aka Instant Runoff Voting) which allows voters in multi-candidate races to rank their choices in order of their preferences and, by a series of instant runoffs allows a voter’s ballot to be transferred to whichever candidate he or she prefers that is still in the running.
I favor it too. I don’t like the idea that a voter whose favorite candidate might not be in the top two, has to decide between not voting for the candidate he actually prefers and “wasting” his vote. We have it in Minneapolis and St. Paul city races. Duluth rejected it by referendum.
Smith is outraged by the gerrymandering of U.S. House districts, for blatant partisan gain. I am too. What rational and fair-minded person isn’t? I know of no principled, ethical, democratic argument in favor of gerrymandering. But whichever party benefits from it feigns oblivion.
Smith favors a constitutional amendment, if necessary, to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission. In Citizens United, you probably know, the Supreme Court ruled that any practical laws that would keep corporate money out of election campaigns would violate the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech. I favor freeing our democracy from the campaign finance mess Citizens United created too; do you?
Smith doesn’t want to do away with capitalism or equalize incomes, but he does favor policies to reduce the historically high and growing concentration of wealth at the very top. I do too. But he’s devoting his 80s to this and the causes above and several more, while I sit here typing.
Smith will be giving several presentations over the weekend. At several of them, some or all of his latest film project, titled: “Winning Back Our Democracy,” will be shown. Here’s the lineup of events, but try to check before you go:
* Sunday, April 28 at 3:00 p.m. at Bethlehem Church, 4100 Lyndale Ave. S., Minneapolis;
* Monday, April 29 from noon-1:30pm at Film North in St. Paul (Vandalia Tower at 550 Vandalia St., Suite 120);
* Monday, April 29 at 6:30 p.m. at Stillwater Library, 224 3rd St N., Stillwater
* Tuesday, April 30 at 7:00 p.m. at Coon Rapids Civic Center
* Thursday, May 2 at 6:00 p.m. at the Southdale Library in Edina

Texto completo: Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. felt the first stirrings of what would become his latest book, "Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow," during his 1969-70 sophomore year at Yale. He was enrolled in his first African-American history course - no such classes were given at his high school - and was introduced to Reconstruction, the brief period after the Civil War when blacks exerted their newfound rights and leadership in the former slave states. The course also covered the racist reaction to Reconstruction, known as Redemption, Gates writes, "when the former Confederate states 'redeemed' themselves at the expense of black rights" and took up with vehemence and violence the dictates of white supremacy. "I have connected Reconstruction with Redemption ever since, as the apex and nadir ... of the African American experience."
During that academic year, Gates also took a course on the Harlem Renaissance, a period of black intellectual and artistic ferment from the late 19th century to the mid-1920s; he continued to study that period and the emergence in those years of what became known as the New Negro. "In this book," Gates writes, "I attempt to show that the New Negro was the black community's effort to roll back Redemption, which was itself a rollback to Reconstruction, and to do so by coining a metaphor, of all things, and then by seeking to embody that metaphor." The result is "Stony the Road" - as Gates describes it, "an intellectual and cultural history of black agency and the resistance to and institutionalization of white supremacy." His title is borrowed from James Weldon Johnson's 1900 poem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing," known as the Negro national anthem: "Stony the road we trod/ Bitter the chast'ning rod."
Gates' book covers territory well known to scholars and Civil War buffs: how our received wisdom of the "tragic decade" of Reconstruction flows from two polluted streams, the myth of the Lost Cause and the Jim Crow segregation mania that swept American legislatures and popular entertainment after 1900. For those wishing to know more about this dismal story of racial hysteria in places as high as Woodrow Wilson's White House and as low as the blackface minstrel show, "Stony the Road" is excellent one-stop shopping. With a main text of about 250 pages, Gates offers a compressed yet surprisingly comprehensive narrative sweep, in addition to the usual catalog of political sins, an overview of the lesser-known stories of how our "best" universities, such as Columbia and Harvard, allowed two pseudo-disciplines - "scientific racism" and eugenics - to create a false dogma of black misrule and white suffering at the center of the Reconstruction narrative.
With a dazzling selection of cartoon stereotypes, the author shows that in the white supremacist reaction "all along, the issue had been about the fabrication of hateful imagery in order to justify robbing black people of their constitutional rights and their economic potential."
In tracing the emergence of the New Negro, Gates notes that Booker T. Washington "was named the very first new Negro" by the white press. But Washington was "problematic" - he called for a regime of economic cooperation and social separation as a necessary condition of black progress. Gates observes that Washington was gradually eclipsed by more militant followers of Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois. The latter's scholarship in combination with the Harlem Renaissance saw the emergence of a "newer New Negro" and vigorous pursuit of the rights of equal treatment first promised by the Reconstruction Congress that passed the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments.
Gates is at his most fluent in defining the newer Negro as a feature of the Harlem Renaissance powered by Alain Locke, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson and other key figures of the African-American creative pantheon. Locke is depicted as a flawed visionary who believed that artistic achievement would be as sure a path to equality as politics or economics. "They saw themselves as members of the black upper class," Gates writes, "a cosmopolitan mobile elite that could be integrated into American society, even if 'the slow-moving black masses' (as the head of the Urban League Charles S. Johnson would actually call them) could not."
Notwithstanding his high regard for the Renaissance, Gates clearly tilts toward politics, rather than art-for-art's-sake or pure commerce, as the most reliable vehicle for black progress. "No people, in all of human history, has ever been liberated by the creation of art. None," Gates asserts with a sense of certainty that is a signature of his rhetoric.
Analytically, this is a lively, consistently challenging book. I was struck by a sweeping criticism Gates offers in discussing the Harlem Renaissance. He blames Locke's 1925 anthology, "The New Negro," for ignoring "those great geniuses of black vernacular culture, the musicians who created the world's greatest art form in the entire twentieth century - jazz." The grandiose language feels like special pleading, based on personal taste, but Gates usefully reminds us that "jazz and its companion blues," while rooted in black culture, have a unique place in one of modernity's great stories, the African-American experience on the American continent in the previous century. Gates' telling of that story is a contribution to what we ought to be thinking about, given the rocky launch of this newest American century.

Buttigieg Battles Mike Pence, or So He Imagines

Texto completo: Vice President Mike Pence and 2020 Democratic hopeful Pete Buttigieg have been embroiled in a notable fight over the past few weeks -- "notable" mostly because the vice president hasn't been involved.
Mr. Buttigieg went after Mr. Pence unprompted at the LGBTQ Victory Fund's National Champagne Brunch April 7. Referring disparagingly to "the Mike Pences of the world," the South Bend, Ind., mayor told the audience that the former governor has a "quarrel" with him because Mr. Buttigieg is gay.
Mr. Pence's response? "I've known Mayor Pete for many years," he told CNN. "I considered him a friend. He knows I don't have a problem with him."
For years, Democrats have engaged in these sorts of shadow-boxing matches against Mr. Pence, swinging their arms at a hateful caricature that doesn't exist. To Republicans' amusement, the vice president's would-be adversaries have yet to get much of a rise out of him -- and little wonder, he is one of the more polite and good-natured people in Washington. Yet the media eagerly cover these fights as if they were one-on-one, even though they're one-on-zero.
When Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon last year criticized Mr. Pence's alleged past support for conversion therapy, the New York Times published a headline: "Mike Pence Tangles With Olympian Adam Rippon Over Gay Rights Record." In reality, Mr. Rippon's comments seem to have come unprompted, and Mr. Pence responded by tweeting to Mr. Rippon: "I want you to know we are FOR YOU . . . I am proud of you." That's some tangle.
The media even turn amicable meetings into dramatic showdowns. The website NowThis News implied that Mr. Pence was uncomfortable at a reception with the head of Ireland's government, posting a video of the encounter and inviting its readers: "Please enjoy Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar bringing his boyfriend to meet Mike Pence." The same thing happened when Mr. Pence swore in Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who is bisexual. "He seems uncomfortable and she's having fun with it," tweeted Adam Best, a co-host of a left-leaning podcast.
Yet on both occasions Mr. Pence acted with grace and dignity. He praised Mr. Varadkar's partner for his work at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and the prime minister told reporters afterward that the Pence family said the couple were "welcome to visit their home in the future," calling it "a very nice gesture." Mr. Pence laughed with Ms. Sinema when the senator, who is single, pointed to the "spouse" sticker used when married senators are administered the oath and jokingly asked the audience: "Could we get a spouse?"
The sustained, one-sided assault Mr. Buttigieg has launched in recent weeks is particularly low because he knows the man behind the caricature, a fellow Hoosier, very well. In 2015, when asked his thoughts about Mr. Buttigieg's "coming out," then-Gov. Pence said without hesitation: "I hold Mayor Buttigieg in the highest personal regard. We have a great working relationship. I see him as a dedicated public servant and a patriot."
The portrait Mr. Buttigieg paints of Mr. Pence now that he's running for the White House differs dramatically from his previous descriptions of the man. On meeting Mr. Pence for the first time in 2011, Mr. Buttigieg wrote, "I was surprised by how affable, even gentle he seemed." He later said that Mr. Pence was "noticeably moved by my deployment" to Afghanistan in 2014 and that he personally called Mr. Buttigieg on his drive to the military base. By contrast, last month the mayor wondered aloud if Mr. Pence "stopped believing in Scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump."
If the average Democrat wants to swing at a cardboard cutout of the vice president to boost his fundraising numbers, then so be it. But for Mr. Buttigieg to question the faith of a man he knows better than most after a close, yearslong working relationship is shameful. The mayor knows better, and his insults say far more about his character than about the vice president's.

Food meets heart at the 17-year-old Pastabilities

Texto completo: For husband-and-wife team Vassilios and Deborah Tsaganis, owners of Pastabilities & More in south Fort Myers since 2002, their restaurant doesn't feel like work.
"It's a passion for us," said Deborah, who manages the front of the house while Vassilios runs the kitchen.
"We don't look at it as work. Every day I wake up and I say: Today's going to be a great day."
That passion for the restaurant business has been going for more than two decades. Before the pair moved to Fort Myers, they owned The Quay on Duval Street in Key West for 13 years.
"That was a big restaurant," Deborah said. "It was a very, very busy restaurant. Then we decided we wanted to downsize and relax a little bit, go more family-oriented."
Which is how the pair ended up in Fort Myers, a place, Deborah said, that's a good blend of island life and city living.
"You don't have to drive all the way to Miami to go shopping," she said, "like we used to have to. Key West is beautiful, but sometimes you'd catch a little bit of island fever."
The pair first took over Pastabilities in its previous location off San Carlos Boulevard in what is now the Walmart plaza. In 2010, they moved to their current location on San Carlos Boulevard between Summerlin and Kelly roads.
Deborah, who is originally from Dublin, Ireland, is a staple in the restaurant, and she's come to know her customers and their families over the years.
"I was just talking to one of my customers yesterday, and I asked how her granddaughter is doing. I remember her being in a highchair, and now she's 17," Deorah said.
"The kids are growing up right in front of me. It's a nice feeling. I remember one customer's son having prom dinner here. There were about 20 of them. Now he's a lawyer, and he's married. Where did the years go? It just seems like yesterday when they were small."
The restaurant's customers come back for this warm, family-oriented hospitality — and for the food.
The menu is Italian-focused, though it also offers Mediterranean and continental dishes with an emphasis on seafood. Everything is made to order (which, Deborah points out, helps in accommodating people's food allergies and intolerances).
Some of the most popular dishes include the snapper Cozumel with yellow tail snapper, Gulf shrimp, sea scallops, fresh basil, mushrooms and garlic in a Trebbiano white wine sauce. The seafood cioppino features more snapper and shrimp, sea scallops, clams and mussels in a spicy marina sauce. The snapper Grand Marnier is finished with orange slices and roasted almonds.
"It's a beautiful dish," Deborah said. "The sweetness reduces, and it's not overpowering. It has a beautiful flavor, especially topped with the mandarin orange slices."
The restaurant also make its own soups — lobster bisque, crab bisque, chicken Florentine, pasta fagioli — and desserts, plus Italian favorites such as lasagna, manicotti and stuffed shells.
Though Pastabilities is only open for dinner, the couple starts each day at 3 a.m.
"We go in early in the morning because we make everything there in the restaurant," Deborah said.
"It's time consuming, which is OK. We don't like to rush things. We do everything with a lot of heart."

Texto completo: Among the many interesting words in the 448-page Mueller report were those quoting an email from Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's closest aide, in response to associates who arranged Carter Page's speaking invitation in St. Petersburg in July 2016.
Mr. Peskov wrote, "I have read about [Page]. Specialists say that he is far from being the main one. So I better not initiate a meeting in the Kremlin."
So much (again) for the idea that the insubstantial Mr. Page was collusion's Mr. Big. Washington's intelligence and law-enforcement bureaucracy knows a great deal more about things that have been central bones of contention in our national political life than the American people have been allowed to know. In what I hope will be the first of many, a New York Times story last weekend finally described -- two years late -- the FBI's suspicion that the Steele Dossier was influenced by Kremlin disinformation.
Likewise a few hundred officials with security clearances know the truth behind FBI Director James Comey's serial interventions in the Hillary Clinton email case -- interventions that began, we learned only belatedly from press leaks, with some kind of intercepted Russian intelligence that someone placed in Mr. Comey's hands.
The questions raised by these episodes are monumental and will outlast the war over whether Mr. Trump is a nice man or not. Did Mr. Comey and his colleagues turn us into Russia, where the siloviki (veterans of the intelligence services) secretly and incompetently pull the strings of domestic politics?
Not satisfied to pick at his many deficiencies or oppose him in normal fashion, Mr. Trump's enemies promoted one of the biggest lies in U.S. history. Two years later, we are back to square one with a difference: Now much of America rightly thinks his media and partisan enemies are every bit as sleazy as Mr. Trump was said to be. In regard to personal ethics, his biggest vulnerability, millions now see even less of a difference between Mr. Trump and his opponents than they did in 2016.
When these Americans hear certain Democrats chanting "Impeach Trump now," they hear the mumbled corollary "before the American people can re-elect him."
He came to the presidency the best known and most perfectly understood candidate in history. Fifteen years before he tossed his hat in the ring, "The Simpsons" could deliver a two-word joke that needed no setup: "President Trump."
I mention this not to demean the president. The idea that his arrival somehow sullied the culture of Washington not only is absurdly overstated, it licensed the mood of conspiracy against him. He is not even the sketchiest person to hold the office in my lifetime. "There was no trusting anything he said or did on a given day," writes the historian Robert Dallek -- in his book about Lyndon Johnson.
Mr. Trump is simply the sketchiest that voters ever knowingly, deliberately, with clear eyes-full hearts, elected.
He could help himself even now by conducting his presidency differently. If his approval rating were even 50%, many fewer Democrats would find it in their electoral interest to endorse unsubstantiated slanders against him.
Still, a couple of things are true. People who are innocent tend to protest their innocence. A president who sees law enforcement itself peddling fabricated evidence can be forgiven for wondering if the law has been corrupted.
As Mr. Trump's lawyer told Bob Mueller and Mr. Mueller reportedly accepted in good spirit, a president is obliged to fight back against politically motivated attacks. And for all his warts, Mr. Trump fought back more transparently than any past president would have or would have been able to, mostly on Twitter, in his own voice, taking ownership of each claim made in his defense.
The truth is, Mr. Trump is hardly capable of lying with the consistency of purpose that John Brennan and James Clapper have lied and likely will continue to lie. His White House was destined to be chaotic but how many presidents would not be thrown off balance by former high-ranking intelligence officials going on cable TV and calling them traitors?
If Mr. Trump's historically assigned task was to expose Washington's media and leadership class, with Robert Mueller's help he has succeeded. Nobody (including me) would have guessed how much our intelligence sector had come to regard itself as the guardian of a particular class's right to rule, or see its job as punishing voters when they vote wrong.
I say the following without prejudice to the real Pete Buttigieg, whom I haven't studied and who may turn out to be just another unappetizing politician. If I were a screenwriter, a gay mayor from South Bend, Ind., is exactly the character I'd invent to step over the wreckage created by Mr. Trump and his enemies and restore sanity to the American experiment.

Texto completo: A continuing trial into corruption in NCAA basketball took a turn into college football Tuesday, when a former Pittsburgh financial adviser said he paid players from several major football programs, including Pitt and Penn State.
Marty Blazer, an informant for federal investigators into their probe of payments made to college basketball players, testified that between 2010 and 2014 he paid anywhere between several hundred to several thousand dollars to football players from Pitt, Penn State, Alabama, Michigan, North Carolina and Northwestern, according to reports from the trial from the New York Times' Adam Zagoria and Yahoo Sports' Dan Wetzel.

Blazer's testimony for the government implicated former Penn State football star Aaron Maybin. Per reports from Wetzel, Blazer said a Penn State football assistant asked him to pay a player's father $10,000 so his son wouldn't enter the 2009 NFL Draft. The son entered the draft anyway and was selected 11th overall by the Buffalo Bills, with his father later repaying the $10,000.
Maybin, selected 11th by the Bills in 2009, played two seasons for Buffalo and two for the New York Jets.

No players were referenced by name and former Penn State assistant Larry Johnson Sr. denied the accusations, Wetzel reported.
Blazer is testifying for the government in the trial of Merl Code, a former shoe company consultant, and Christian Dawkins, an aspiring agent. The trial is looking into alleged bribes paid to NCAA basketball assistant coaches for steering top players to Dawkins' company.
Code and Dawkins previously were convicted and sentenced to six months in prison for their roles in funneling money to top recruits and their families to play for Adidas-sponsored basketball schools. Adidas executive James Gatto also was convicted in the case.
Assistant basketball coaches at several schools, including Arizona, Auburn, Creighton, Louisville, Oklahoma State, TCU and USC were fired in the wake of the ongoing investigation, as was former Louisville coach Rick Pitino.
Arizona coach Sean Miller, a Blackhawk native and former Pitt basketball star, was accused of paying players and was expected to testify in the trial, but judge Edgardo Ramos ruled last week he wouldn't have to take the witness stand.
Blazer faces 67 years in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of wire fraud and one each of aggravated identity theft, securities fraud and lying to the Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to a Ponzi scheme in which he was accused of taking millions of dollars from clients to invest in two movies.
Former Pitt offensive lineman Jason Pinkston, a Baldwin graduate who played for the Panthers from 2007-10, called Blazer a "clown" on Twitter.

Texto completo: Una vez más el presidente Donald Trump se vuelca a Twitter para arremeter contra sus críticos, esta vez haciendo una inusual exigencia.
Trump atacó al premio Nobel de economía, Paul Krugman y columnista del New York Times acusándolo de estar “obsesionado con el odio” de su administración.
En un par de tweets, Trump arremitió contra Krugman por lo que llamó “escritos falsos y altamente inexactos” después de la columna más reciente de Krugman, que dice que los republicanos ya no apoyan los valores estadounidenses.
“Paul Krugman, de Fake News New York Times, ha perdido toda credibilidad, al igual que el propio Times, con sus escritos falsos y altamente inexactos sobre mí”, escribió Trump. “Está obsesionado con el odio, al igual que otros están obsesionados con lo estúpido que es. Dijo que el mercado se estrellaría, ¡Sólo los máximos históricos!”
“Me pregunto si el New York Times se disculpará conmigo por segunda vez, como lo hicieron después de las elecciones de 2016”, continuó Trump. “Pero este tendrá que ser una disculpa mucho más grande y mejor. En este caso, tendrán que arrodillarse y pedir perdón, ¡son verdaderamente el Enemigo del Pueblo!”
Paul Krugman, of the Fake News New York Times, has lost all credibility, as has the Times itself, with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred, just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash, Only Record Highs!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019
I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019
Tras revisar el reporte de Robert Mueller, Krugman acusó a presidente y su campaña de “recibier con agrado” la asistencia rusa durante las elecciones de 2016, una referencia a los hallazgos del informe que determinó que los agentes rusos interfirieron en las elecciones de 2016 con la intención de apoyar la candidatura de Trump.
“Una potencia extranjera hostil intervino en las elecciones presidenciales, con la esperanza de instalar a Donald Trump en la Casa Blanca. La campaña de Trump fue consciente de esta intervención y la acogió. Y una vez en el poder, Trump intentó bloquear cualquier investigación sobre lo que sucedió”, Krugman. escribió.

Trump and Allies Ramp Up Attacks on McGahn

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Donald F. McGahn II arrived in a windowless conference room in southwest Washington in November 2017 to meet for the first time with the special counsel's investigators. He was the White House counsel at the time, and he was reluctant to answer their questions for fear that President Trump would one day blame him for any damaging revelations.
A year and a half later, the scapegoating has begun. Mr. Trump and his surrogates began attacking Mr. McGahn shortly after the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, revealed he was the chief witness to the president's attempts to undermine the inquiry. In an interview on Monday, a member of Mr. Trump's legal team challenged Mr. McGahn's motives and memory and accused investigators of ignoring inconsistencies in his assertions.
"This is a cross-examination a law student could perform -- by the time he's finished, you would come to the conclusion he's hopelessly confused" and would be "shaking," Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, said of Mr. McGahn's interviews with investigators.
Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that he was amping up attacks on Mr. McGahn in an attempt to undermine the Mueller report as Democrats called for their congressional leaders to use it as a basis for impeachment proceedings. The Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Mr. McGahn on Monday to testify next month and hand over documents.
"We have no choice but to attack because the Democrats say there is impeachable material here," Mr. Giuliani said.
Mr. McGahn's lawyer, William A. Burck, declined to comment on the subpoena but pushed back on Mr. Giuliani, saying that his client stood by the accounts he gave the special counsel.
"The report speaks for itself, and no amount of obfuscation by Mr. Giuliani is going to fool anyone," Mr. Burck said in a statement. "Don told the truth to Mueller."
The attacks by Mr. Trump and his allies demonstrate the pivotal roles that Mr. McGahn played in the Russia inquiry. As the chief White House lawyer, he stepped in repeatedly to thwart Mr. Trump's attempts to curtail the investigation. But he also served as the unofficial narrator of the special counsel's report on whether the president obstructed justice. He is cited 157 times, more than any other witness.
Mr. Trump's lawyers have homed in on his account of Mr. Trump's ordering the special counsel fired in June 2017 and later attempts to get Mr. McGahn to recant what he told investigators about the episode. The encounters -- lawmakers are pursuing documents about them -- are two of the most damning examples of potential obstruction of justice laid out in the Mueller report and show the clearest example of Mr. Trump attempting to influence witness testimony.
Days after a New York Times article in January 2018 revealed that the president directed Mr. McGahn to have the Justice Department fire Mr. Mueller, Mr. Trump told a senior aide he was considering firing Mr. McGahn. The president also wanted Mr. McGahn to create a paper trail denying his own account by writing a letter to keep on file, "something beyond a press statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate," according to the report.
Mr. McGahn refused, setting up an Oval Office confrontation with the president. Mr. Trump denied that he ordered Mr. Mueller fired, saying he had instead wanted Mr. McGahn to alert the Justice Department to what the president contended were several conflicts of interest of Mr. Mueller, according to the report. But Mr. McGahn reminded the president that he had indeed told him to fire the special counsel, the report said. The president again asked Mr. McGahn to issue a correction to the Times article, but Mr. McGahn refused.
"McGahn thought the president was testing his mettle to see how committed McGahn was to what happened," Mr. Mueller's investigators wrote.
Mr. Giuliani has picked up where Mr. Trump left off, insisting that the president never told Mr. McGahn to have Mr. Mueller fired. He said the president was only venting.
Mr. Giuliani also falsely asserted that Mr. McGahn provided conflicting accounts to investigators.
"This is much more a sleight of hand by special counsel than by McGahn because it sounds like McGahn gave two to three different versions," Mr. Giuliani said, adding that he thought Mr. Mueller's report was a "disgrace" because it left out that Mr. Trump brought up the special counsel's perceived conflicts of interest with other people without demanding he be fired.
Mr. Burck said his client was simply telling the truth under threat of perjury, not accusing the president of illegally obstructing justice.
"Clients sometimes approach their lawyers with bad ideas," Mr. Burck said. "That's not obstruction -- it just comes with the territory. Don did his job. Mueller was not removed."
Mr. Giuliani's attacks on Mr. McGahn have unnerved some senior White House officials, who have argued privately that the president and his legal team should stop drawing attention to damaging episodes in the report, according to two people close to the White House. But Mr. Trump has privately complained about the accounts, particularly the ones given by Mr. McGahn, and has said the only way to protect himself from impeachment is to attack Mr. Mueller and Mr. McGahn, the people said.
Mr. McGahn's harmful testimony stems from the president's own decision two years ago to fully cooperate with the inquiry and apparent ignorance about the implications of allowing his aides to describe private conversations to investigators.
The president believed that he was hastening the end of the investigation, according to a former White House official. But the decision perplexed Mr. McGahn, who expressed the view that Mr. Trump should take a more aggressive approach to the investigation, the official said. On a personal level, he also expressed concern that the president was setting him up to take the fall by allowing him to openly speak with the Mueller team.
"What Mr. Giuliani seems to forget is that it was the president who decided Don should fully cooperate -- despite available privileges -- and who made it public," Mr. Burck said.
Mr. Trump belied a lack of understanding about his agreement to waive executive privilege when he confronted Mr. McGahn in the Oval Office meeting early last year.
Mr. McGahn said that he had no choice but to reveal to investigators the president's attempt to have Mr. Mueller fired because he was not protected by attorney-client privilege in his role as White House counsel, a post that exists to protect the presidency itself, rather than the president. At the time, Mr. Trump also knew that the White House had handed over many handwritten notes that Mr. McGahn's chief of staff had kept about his interactions with the president.
"What about those notes? Why do you take notes?" Mr. Trump asked Mr. McGahn, according to the report. "Lawyers don't take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes."
Mr. McGahn said that he was a "real lawyer" and that taking notes was a good way to create a record.
"I've had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn," Mr. Trump said, referring to his former lawyer and fixer who was later disbarred for ethics violations.

MEASLES CASES ABOUT TO SURPASS A 20-YEAR RECORD: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday that at least 626 people have been infected with measles as of April 19, bringing the U.S. even closer to surpassing the previous record number of cases since the virus was considered to be largely eliminated here in 2000.

The last time an outbreak was close to the current level was in 2014, when 667 people were infected. In that instance, the outbreaks were clustered in Amish communities in Ohio where people had not been vaccinated. In this outbreak, clusters are occurring in New York State, New York City, and New Jersey, primarily among unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities.

CDC said on its website that it expects this outbreak likely will surpass the 2014 record “in the coming weeks.”

Measles spreads quickly among pockets of people that haven’t been vaccinated. It’s hard to contain because it’s not only highly contagious — spreading via infected surfaces, among people, and through the air — but also because people are contagious for four days before and after they get a rash. This means people start to have symptoms such as runny nose, cough, and red eyes without knowing they have measles because they haven’t broken out in the tell-tale rash.

The majority of people who caught the virus this year were not given the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella — MMR — which children are supposed to get around the age of 1 and again before they enter kindergarten. The first vaccine has a 95 percent effectiveness rate, and the booster has a 99 percent protection rate.

Schools require children to get vaccinated, but some states allow exceptions for religious or philosophical reasons. Given the latest outbreak, state lawmakers have urged for stricter rules about exemptions, and New York has mandated that residents get vaccinated.

Though a fear of vaccines contributes to measles outbreaks, other factors also contribute, including that parents try to space out vaccines or don’t make it to the doctor on schedule. Also, adults over a certain age haven’t had the second MMR vaccine because public health initiatives calling for two vaccines didn’t start until 1989. This means that policymakers may have to think about other ways to get people vaccinated, such as urging more adults to get the booster.

People who get measles become immune for life, but the illness can be much more dangerous and even deadly for some people. Before the creation of a vaccine in 1963, as many as 4 million got the virus, 48,000 of whom were hospitalized and 500 died. Another 1,000 developed brain swelling known as encephalitis.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER FEDERAL SEX DISCRIMINATION LAW PROTECTS LGBT WORKERS: The Supreme Court will decide whether a federal civil rights law barring workplace discrimination on the basis of sex provides protections for gay and transgender employees.

The court on Monday said it would take up a trio of cases involving Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. Two of the cases raise the question of whether Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, while the third centers on whether the law bars discrimination based on gender identity.

SCOTUS CONSIDERS CASE ON FOOD STAMP DISCLOSURE: The Supreme Court on Monday is hearing a public information case in which the Argus Leader, a North Dakota newspaper, will argue that it should have access to financial information detailing how much money stores make off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.

The Food Marketing Institute says the information is confidential. The Argus Leader has fought for access for eight years, hoping not only to see what companies profit the most but whether any stores are outliers, a move that could reveal instances of fraud.

COURT PROCEEDINGS STAYED FOR DAVID DALEIDEN: A two-week trial originally scheduled to kick off in San Francisco Monday for David Daleiden and Susan Merritt , who secretly taped abortion providers for the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress, was suspended on Friday until further notice.

California Superior Court Judge Christopher Hite had been set to decide whether the attorney general can present enough evidence to require Daleiden and Merritt to defend themselves against 15 felony counts at a full-dress jury trial later this year. The Planned Parenthood workers in the video were scheduled to testify in court for the case, The People of the State of California v. David Robert Daleiden and Sandra Susan Merritt .

ALMOST HALF OF US WORKSITES OFFER WELLNESS PROGRAMS: STUDY: Worksite health promotion and wellness programs continue to grow in American workplaces. The Workplace Health in America 2017 report found that 69 percent of worksites had a health promotion program for at least three years, and 17 percent of worksites had a comprehensive workplace health promotion program, which is an increase from 7 percent in 2004. CDC and researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Global Public Health captured the status of workplace health and safety programs and use of proven, effective employee health and well-being strategies, including health benefits design, and physical changes to the work environment.

FDA APPROVES FIRST GENERIC NALOXONE SPRAY: The Food and Drug Administration Friday granted final approval of the first generic naloxone nasal spray, known as Narcan, a life-saving medication that can stop or reverse a potentially fatal opioid overdose. “Moving forward we will prioritize our review of generic drug applications for naloxone,” said Dr. Douglas Throckmorton , deputy center director for regulatory programs in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. This is the first approval for a generic overdose reversal nasal spray that can be administered by those without medical training.

FDA PERMITS MARKETING OF FIRST MEDICAL DEVICE TO TREAT ADHD: The FDA permitted marketing Friday of the first non-drug medical device, the Monarch eTNS System, to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in patients between 7- and 12-years-old. A small wire connects to a patch on the patient’s forehead, generating low-level electrical pulses which send therapeutic signals to parts of the brain believed to be tied to ADHD. It feels like a slight tingling on the forehead, and can be used in the patient’s home under the supervision of a caregiver.

BORDER PATROL EXPECTS TO QUADRUPLE SPENDING AS MORE IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARRIVE IN ARIZONA: Border patrol agents expect to spend four times as much on food, baby products, and on-site medical care in 2019 for illegal immigrants apprehended at the border as it did last year. Agents apprehended 25,000 immigrants traveling as parts of families in southwestern Arizona over the past six months and As of March 31, the halfway point into fiscal 2019, the sector had spent $600,000 on those same items and services.

CONGOLESE MILITIA MEMBERS ATTACK EBOLA TREATMENT CENTER: Rebel groups attacked an ebola-treatment hospital Friday in Butembo, killing Dr. Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung , a World Health Organization epidemiologist from Cameroon and injuring a Congo health ministry staffer and a driver. Militia members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo believe foreigners brought the disease with them to the DRC and have attacked hospitals no fewer than four times since February.

Column: Mueller report: How not to obstruct justice

Texto completo: There are many ways to understand special counsel Robert Mueller’s long-anticipated report.
It confirms, for anyone left doubting, that Russia did indeed meddle in the 2016 election. It did not find evidence showing that President Donald Trump and his associates engaged in any criminal conspiracy with Russia in their meddling. And it suggests reasonable legal minds can differ on whether the president could be indicted over obstructing that investigation.
Most of all it paints a picture of a president woefully out of his depth in his first months on the job. Far from being devious, Mueller portrays Trump as a bumbling bully, cajoling and pressuring his underlings to no avail.
He asks his deputy national security adviser, K.T. McFarland, to draft a statement saying he did not order Michael Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador. He orders White House counsel Don McGahn to shut down Mueller’s investigation. My favorite example is an incident where Trump requests his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, to tell his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to un-recuse himself from the Russia investigation.
When a competent and corrupt boss urges subordinates to cross ethical or legal lines, they comply, sealing a corrupt bond. For Trump though, the subordinates declined, demurred or flat out refused. McGahn threatened to resign, and Trump backed down. Lewandowski fobbed off his errand to an underling, who ended up ignoring the order. McFarland made it known that she felt uncomfortable drafting a statement she didn’t know to be true.
All of this is relevant to the open questions raised but not answered by Mueller’s report regarding obstruction of justice. Mueller details 10 incidents that may have risen to the level of obstruction, but makes no judgment on the president’s culpability. He is neither indicted nor exonerated.
This obscures the central fact that all of Trump’s attempts to influence the Russia investigation backfired. He dictates a false press release on the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer and his senior campaign team. Then the New York Times publishes the actual emails promising dirt on Hillary Clinton to set up that ill-fated meeting.
Trump fires FBI director James Comey expecting to take the pressure of the Russia investigation off of himself. The president ends up setting into motion the events that lead deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to appoint Mueller as special counsel. Comey himself testified under oath in 2017 that, after his firing, he leaked his personal memos detailing his awkward conversations with Trump in the hopes that it would prompt a special counsel investigation. Comey got his wish.
Much of this comes down to Trump’s decision, shortly after taking office, to retain and try to influence the FBI director he had inherited from the Obama administration. In this case, Trump ignored most of his senior advisers. According to Mueller’s report, at a dinner with Trump and senior advisers on Jan. 26, 2017, the president asked the room what they made of the FBI director. According to Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, “no one openly advocated terminating Comey, but the consensus on him was not positive.” Other sources that worked on the Trump transition team tell me that Flynn urged Trump to fire him before taking office.
Coats however had a different view. According to the report, he thought Comey was a “good director.” He encouraged Trump to “meet Comey face-to-face and spend time with him before making a decision about whether to retain him.”
This turned out to be terrible advice for someone like Trump. The next day, the president invited Comey to a one-on-one dinner, where - according to Comey’s own notes from that time - Trump proceeded to act like a Tammany Hall boss. He tells Comey that he needs his loyalty. Trump asks him if he likes his job. After he fires Flynn, Trump asks Comey to go easy on his former national security adviser. All the while, Comey takes notes on the exchanges and assures Trump privately that he is not a target of the Russia probe.
Imagine if Trump had heeded Flynn’s advice and fired Comey instead of clumsily trying to charm and bully him. Back then it would have been a shrewd maneuver. Many Democrats were still seething at Comey for reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server two weeks before the election. Remember Senator Chuck Schumer saying he lost confidence in him only days before Americans voted in 2016 for president.
It was only after Trump announced that he fired his FBI director because of the Russia investigation that the near two-year probe into his obstruction of justice begins. And despite his threats, and even attempts, Trump never really succeeds at impeding it. The closest he came was to refuse a live interview, on advice of his lawyers. And while Trump rages about “rats” and muses about pardons, every nasty tweet and gaffe-laden interview becomes fodder for Mueller’s lawyers to analyze.
Now that Mueller has concluded his investigation without showing criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia, the folly of Trump’s scheming is apparent. Had he just fired Comey in January 2017 and kept his mouth shut, Trump might still have faced an investigation over ties to Russia, but he could have avoided extending and expanding that so it became a nearly-two-year inquest into possible obstruction of justice as well. Instead, through incompetence and vanity, Trump became an author of his own inquisition and handed Mueller the most damning evidence against him.

Trust, leaks and Julian Assange

Texto completo: Legendary journalist Walter Lippmann had sources in the highest places in Washington. Some evenings would find Lippmann seated opposite President Franklin Roosevelt in the Oval Office and Roosevelt would toss a classified cable at Lippmann and ask: "What do you think?"
Lippmann would give his counsel, but not write about what he had read in that cable. He would not break that trust or, most certainly, destroy his most important relationship.
That kind of relationship between officials and journalists goes on every day in Washington and journalists still keep those confidences. It takes years to develop these kinds of relationships and veteran journalists will not blow up a source relationship for one headline that will soon be subsumed by the churn of the daily news cycle. This exchange of information helps those journalists understand what is happening and the American people benefit from that knowledge.
Conversely, one of my former ambassadors referred to Washington as the world’s largest colander, in that leaking is also a daily occurrence. People leak information — some of it classified — to journalists for a variety reasons. It might be a trial balloon or an effort to sabotage a potential policy. Or, sometimes it is just a matter of ego. "Look what I know!"
Roosevelt expected Lippmann to respect the ground rules they had established over many years. Leakers, on the other hand, expect that the information they provide will be made public to achieve their aims whether it is pure politics or an attempt to blow the whistle on government activity that they believe is illegal or unethical.
WikiLeaks takes this philosophy to the extreme, based on the idea that no government secrets are sacred, and that distinction is at the core of the government’s case against WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange. Interestingly, the Assange indictment is narrowly focused on his role in helping former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning attempt to crack a classified system — apparently unsuccessfully. It does not focus on WikiLeaks’ role in publishing thousands of classified cables.
Most assuredly, Justice Department lawyers understood that in the past the Supreme Court has staunchly defended the First Amendment rights of a free press to act as a check on the government. However, even journalists and free-press advocates are more than uncomfortable with Assange’s extreme methods and fear his case could be used to chip away at those rights.
The court’s support for the right of the press to publish leaked materials had one its most forceful expressions in the 1971 Pentagon Papers case (New York Times v. United States) when Justice Hugo Black wrote in the majority 6-3 decision: "In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Government’s power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government."
And … "The guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at the expense of informed representative government provides no real security … ."
Manning might have thought of herself as justified in arranging for the publication of that information and clearly Assange gave little to no thought about the lives that might be put in danger — especially those who were cooperating with U.S. authorities in conflict zones in Afghanistan and Iraq — or the confidential diplomatic relationships that would be upended. Once leaked, major American media outlets published some of the revealed information, no doubt after consultations with their in-house attorneys.
However, as the extradition of Assange goes forward, the journalistic community in the United States will be watching warily. They fear that pursuit of the Assange case could be used to try to chip away at First Amendment freedoms, especially given the adversarial relationship this Administration has with the media. In a remarkable speech earlier this year, Chief Justice John Roberts asserted that he was the strongest defender of First Amendment rights on the court. If and when the Assange case begins its journey through the courts, the American media and those who understand how crucial those rights are to our democracy will be watching closely to see if that is so.

Texto completo: CAPE TOWN, South Africa - A church building in eastern South Africa partially collapsed at the start of the Easter weekend, killing at least 13 people and injuring 16, during heavy rainfall that caused flooding, power outages and structural damage.
A wall caved in at the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Dlangubo, a small village in KwaZulu-Natal province, shortly after 10 p.m. local time Thursday, according to Robert McKenzie, a spokesman for the province's emergency medical services department.
"There was an electrical storm in the area, and it might have contributed," McKenzie said of the disaster, which took place three days after a devastating fire ripped through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and caused extensive damage to one of the city's most famous landmarks.
Twelve of those killed in South Africa were women, and the 13th was a boy, according to Siphamandla Goge, a reporter with ENCA television who was in the village Friday.
Some of the victims had traveled 60 miles to attend services at the church and were staying overnight, said Thembeka Mbele, a police spokeswoman.
Mildred Oliphant, South Africa's labor minister, is a senior member of the church and had planned to attend the Good Friday service there. She called the accident a "devastating tragedy."
Photographs shared on Twitter show a cavernous, if otherwise nondescript, A-frame building with an entire side missing and bricks strewed across the floor. Storm-related damage was reported across the province, where strong winds ripped the roofs off homes and restaurants, emergency personnel said.
Personal belongings were found up to 650 feet from people's homes because of the strong winds, said Paul Herbst of IPSS Medical Rescue, a private ambulance service in the region.
The families of the victims were "absolutely devastated," Zululand Mayor Thulasizwe Buthelezi said in an interview with the South African Broadcasting Service. Two of the victims had worked for the local municipality, he said, including the mother of a child younger than 5.
A spokesman for Willies Mchunu, premier of KwaZulu-Natal province, told reporters that the deaths were "unnecessary" and "could have been avoided," although he did not elaborate. He called for an investigation into the accident. Officials visited the site Friday morning but could not be reached for comment.
In a statement, the governing African National Congress sent condolences and called on South Africans to "pray for the families to have strength." President Cyril Ramaphosa has visited the church on several occasions, most recently in 2018.
The Easter weekend is an important holiday in South Africa, with many Black families traveling from cities to their rural homesteads. More than 80 percent of South Africans identify as Christian, according to the national statistics bureau.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Addressing reporters from the White House lectern, press secretary Sarah Sanders made a startling claim shortly after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey two years ago.
"I've heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the president's decision," she said, refusing to back down when pressed on the issue. "Between emails, text messages, absolutely," she insisted.
It wasn't true.
She later told prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller that her comments were a "slip of the tongue."
It's a crime to lie to federal investigators or Congress, a lesson that many of Trump's associates found out the hard way. But it's not a crime to lie to reporters and the American people.
The redacted, 448-page Mueller report released Thursday exposed in voluminous detail how the Trump White House is comfortable not only spinning the truth, but outright demolishing it.
Sometimes the president did the lying himself. Sometimes he had others tell lies for him. And sometimes people just lied because they thought it was required of them.
After the president fired Comey, the White House issued a statement saying that Trump had acted on a recommendation from the Justice Department. But Trump had previously decided to sack Comey, and Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, told investigators he believed the president personally dictated the misleading statement.
Days later, when Mueller was appointed special counsel, White House officials told reporters that Trump was undisturbed by the development.
In fact, he was devastated.
"This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency," he said, according to notes taken by an aide.
Trump sometimes lied to his own aides. One episode involved a resignation letter prepared by Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, who had infuriated Trump by recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation.
The president decided not to push out Sessions at the time, but he brought the letter with him on a trip to the Middle East, showing it to senior advisers aboard Air Force One.
Priebus was concerned that the president planned to use the letter as leverage over Sessions, and he asked about it during the trip. Trump falsely said the document was back in his White House residence.
Later that year, Trump tried to prevent the truth from coming out about a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-connected lawyer and senior campaign officials.
Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, recalled telling Trump that emails setting up the meeting looked "really bad."
The messages showed that the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was told the lawyer was working on behalf of the Russian government and would bring damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Then Trump Jr. had emailed back, "If it's what you say I love it."
The president "directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails," the report said.
When the meeting was revealed by The New York Times on July 8, 2017, Trump edited a public statement to conceal crucial details. He removed a line admitting the meeting involved someone who "might have information helpful to the campaign," and he emphasized that participants talked about the adoption of Russian children. The statement was issued under Trump Jr.'s name.
The embarrassing emails soon leaked, contradicting the statement dictated by the president, but the lies continued.
"Over the next several days, the president's personal counsel repeatedly and inaccurately denied that the president played any role in drafting Trump Jr.'s statement," the report said.
Once the president's role was revealed, he downplayed the importance of being honest with the public. "It's a statement to The New York Times. That's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges," Trump told reporters.
The report makes clear that Trump leads a White House where falsehoods and misrepresentations are common practice.
Sanders tried to do damage control on her credibility Friday, insisting that her comments after Comey's firing were made in the "heat of the moment" and that she hadn't intentionally misled the American public.
"I said that it was in the heat of the moment, meaning it wasn't a scripted thing," she said on "CBS This Morning." "But the big takeaway here is that the sentiment is 100% accurate."

Protection fosters suppression

Texto completo: Last month at an event hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, delivered a speech in which she correctly derided Islamophobia, a real and persistent problem in this country and others.
In that speech, Omar invoked the attacks of Sept. 11, saying the council was created "because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."
(As The New York Times pointed out, "The Council on American-Islamic Relations was actually founded in 1994.")
The congresswoman could have used different, more severe language to describe the attacks, but she didn't. Maybe we could judge her use of language as inartful, but we all succumb to that occasionally, me included. Error is inevitable among the loquacious. But, the Omar of the speech stands. I saw nowhere in it a thread of terror apologia.
And yet, conservative media has pounced on four of Omar's words - "some people did something" - as just that. Brian Kilmeade, one of the dull and delusional on "Fox & Friends," questioned her patriotism, saying, "You have to wonder if she's an American first."
Donald Trump upped the ante, retweeting a video of Omar saying, "Some people did something," interspersed with the still-chilling video of the 9/11 attacks. 
Omar is only the most recent minority woman onto whom conservatives have trained their fire.
While white supremacy has historically tried to paint minority men as physically dangerous, it has routinely painted minority women, particularly those strong and vocal, as pathological and reprobate.
There is a pattern here. It is expressed not only in the attacks on, and in elevation of, Omar, but also on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
Before them, Trump and his cohorts demonized Rep. Maxine Waters, who Trump dubbed "Low IQ," and Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida.
In October 2017, Trump tweeted about Wilson:
"Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action & vote R!"
The strategy is simple: While sexism and racism are potent individually, they are devastating in combination, particularly when appealing to a party dominated by white men and which exalts white supremacy and white patriarchy.
The only women they truly honor are white women who obsequiously condone or actively participate in the oppression.
All manner of inhumanity and barbarism have been conducted under the guise of protecting the honor and purity of these white women. 
To advance their oppression, these white men treated white women as victims, and many white women reciprocated by playing the role of victim. In that way, barbarity could be passed off as chivalry.
But for the women who fall outside this constraint - minority women, lesbian and transgender women, liberal women, "nasty" women - the rebuke is brutal. They didn't need protection, but rather, suppression.
These women herald calamity - both the dislodging of white supremacy and the subversion of male supremacy. Conservatives attack these women because the threat they pose is existential.

Texto completo: An attorney for formal White House counsel Don McGahn pushed back against questions about his client’s credibility.

President Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani questioned what McGhan told special counsel Robert Mueller after the release of his redacted report detailing the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

“It’s a mystery why Rudy Giuliani feels the need to re-litigate incidents the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General have concluded were not obstruction. But they are accurately described in the report,” William A. Burck said in a statement.

McGahn cooperated with the special counsel’s team, sitting down for several interviews. In an interview with the New York Times, Giuliani said that McGahn’s testimony about Trump’s alleged interference into the investigation “can’t be taken at face value.”

According to the Mueller team’s findings, the president told McGahn to contact Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to have Mueller fired, ending the investigation.

McGahn served on the White House counsel from 2017 until late last year.

Texto completo: The wife of a deceased Ku Klux Klan leader in Missouri admitted in court Friday to his 2017 shooting death after initially saying two years ago that her son was the murderer.
Now, she says her son didn't help commit the homicide.
Malissa Ancona, 46, pleaded guilty in St. Francois County Circuit Court in Farmington, Missouri, to second-degree murder in the death of Frank Ancona Jr. , the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported, as well as tampering with evidence and the abandonment of a corpse.
As part of her plea agreement with state prosecutors, she was sentenced to life in prison.
Ancona, who was 51 when he died in February 2017, was imperial wizard of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which is believed to have only a few dozen members nationwide.
The group, based in Park Hills, Missouri, had a presence last year in South Dakota and Florida, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. The Knights has had chapters in Idaho and Pennsylvania as well.
Frank Ancona Jr. was killed by gun shot wounds to the head, a coroner determined, after he was found dead on a bank of the Big River near Belgrade, Missouri, about 70 miles southwest of St. Louis.
Originally, Malissa Ancona, of Leadwood, Missouri, reported her husband missing. She then said that her son, Paul Jinkerson Jr. – the stepson of Frank Ancona Jr. – killed him while he was sleeping with a 9-millimeter handgun after he had asked for a divorce.
But she later changed her tune again in letters from jail, according to the Post-Dispatch. She said she was "under the influence" when she made her first statements and instead took the blame for the killing.
"I fired both shots that killed my husband,” the Post-Dispatch reported Malissa Ancona told a judge Friday.
In addition, Ancona admitted in court to cleaning the walls of their bedroom and disposing of bloody bedding and dumping Frank Ancona Jr. ’s body near Belgrade, Missouri.
Jinkerson, 26, is facing first-degree murder charges and, also like Malissa Ancona, charges of abandoning a corpse and tampering with evidence. But Malissa Ancona said in court Friday that Jinkerson was not guilty of murder, only the other two crimes.
Frank Ancona Sr. testified in court that Malissa Ancona killed her son because he was going to leave his wife, the Post-Dispatch reported.
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of Ku Klux Klan groups, around 30 in 2017, has plummeted.
On its website, the center says that the Klan has tried to form alliances with similar organizations, such as the League of the South and the National Socialist Movement, to "retain some semblance of relevance. "
Frank Ancona Jr. told the New York Times in an interview before his death that he had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan for 30 years and had founded the Traditionalist American Knights of the Klan in 2009.
The New York Times reported that Frank Ancona Jr. 's Ku Klux Klan faction, although not large in number, was successful in distributing pamphlets in the aftermath of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, that urged using "lethal force" against protesters.
The high-profile shooting brought attention to Frank Ancona Jr. , who appeared on national television, to discuss how the race protests following a white police officer's shooting of an unarmed black man had rallied KKK members.
Among other recent activity, the group under Frank Ancona Jr. 's leadership also passed out pamphlets in several towns in Maine, the Times reported.
In explaining his philosophy, he told the newspaper that his group is nonviolent, supports the separation of races and opposes what he called "equality propaganda. "
“They want to portray us as all toothless, redneck tobacco chewers,” Frank Ancona Jr told The Times. “Some of us are! But some of us are college educated. I am a business owner. . . . We just believe in promoting traditional American values. ”

Texto completo: In a year of rebound for tech public offerings, Pinterest and Zoom Video Communications on Thursday became the latest Bay Area companies to join the IPO caravan and each got off to a smashing start.
Both companies' public debuts showed the continuing enthusiasm for tech on Wall Street, which has been waiting for several so-called "unicorns" private companies with valuations of at least $1 billion to hit the trading block. Ride-hailing company Lyft went public just two weeks ago, and its shares have stumbled since its debut, creating some anxiety about what Thursday's results would show.
Not to worry, at least not yet: Pinterest, the image-sharing and information company that allows users to "pin" images and links of things they find and like online, saw its shares climb more than 28 percent to end the day at $24.40 after setting its initial public offering price at $19 a share. With its IPO off and running and with 75 million shares on the market the San Francisco-based company raised $1.43 billion, and its valuation rose to more than $12 billion.
Clement Thibault, senior analyst at Investing.com, said he was skeptical about Pinterest's growth prospects in the United States. However, he said there is one quality it does have in its favor as a newly public company.
"Pinterest is on its way to profitability," he said. "(That is) something we can't say about many big IPOs. So it's definitely got some good things going for it, and it could be a buy when the IPO craze runs its course."
Pinterest also holds the distinction of being one of the last, if not the last, of what might be considered the old guard of social media-based companies to come out from shadow of privacy and into the public light. The 10-year-old company has finally gone public years after the likes of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
With approximately 250 million monthly active users, Pinterest has sold itself as a site of positive social interaction. According to The New York Times, which cited Pinterest's IPO prospectus, the company's philosophy has been on "personal growth and planning, rather than on comments and interactions with others." And while not mentioning any other social media companies by name, Pinterest said its focus has helped it "sidestep the bullying, toxic behavior and disinformation that have plagued other social platforms in recent years."
But when it came to share-price performance, Pinterest looked almost pedestrian compared to San Jose-based Zoom.
The cloud-based conferencing technology company's shares surged more than 72 percent, to close at $62 each. Zoom initially priced 20.9 million shares of its stock at $36 a piece Wednesday night. The reaction gave Zoom a valuation of $15.9 billion, which blew past the $1 billion the company was valued at in 2017 when it last took in private financing.
Zoom CFO Kelly Steckelberg, speaking from the Nasdaq Market Site, called the day a "milestone for the company."
"We'd been working toward this for a while," she said. "Our financial results were good. There was a lot of demand and interest during our investor roadshow. The market conditions were great, and everything kind of just all came together."
Lyft kicked off the latest round of IPO mania when, on March 29, the ride-hailing company went public at a price of $72 a share, then rose almost 9 percent to end its first day as public company at $78.29. However, Lyft has since seen investors' interest fade; the company's shares closed Thursday at $58.36.
Anticipation is expected to continue to grow in advance of Uber's upcoming IPO, which is set to take place next month. That public offering is expected to dwarf all others this year, and it could set ride-hailing giant Uber up with a valuation of $100 billion, making it one of the biggest IPOs of all time.

Texto completo: Un grupo de milicias armadas de derecha operando a lo largo de la frontera sur detuvo a un grupo de 200 inmigrantes que buscaban asilo y los amenzó con armas de fuego hasta que llegaron los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza.
Esta milicia armada, que se llama a sí mismo Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos , dijo que está decidido a monitorear la frontera hasta que el Presidente Donald Trump cumpla su promesa de campaña de un muro fronterizo o hasta que el Congreso promulgue una legislación más fuerte para hacer más difícil que los inmigrantes soliciten asilo, dijo Jim Benvie portavoz del grupo en entrevista con el New York Times.
Al conocer sobre los hechos la gobernadora de Nuevo México, Michelle Lujan Grisham, en una declaración al diario neoyorquino dijo que es “completamente inaceptable” que los inmigrantes sean “Amenazados” al ingresar a los Estados Unidos por este tipo de grupos.
La Unión Americana de Libertades civiles ACLU aseguró en una declaración que “el racismo vil de la administración Trump” es lo que le da alas a este tipo de grupos radicales.
Por su parte la Patrulla Fronteriza a través de su portavoz, Carlos A. Díaz, dijo en una declaración que la CBP “no respalda a grupos privados u organizaciones que tomen asuntos de cumplimiento en sus propias manos “.

Prominent challenger outraises Steve King

Texto completo: State Sen. Randy Feenstra massively outraised incumbent Rep. Steve King in the first reported filings, according to recent Federal Election Commission filings.
Feenstra, one of multiple Republicans running to oust Rep. Steve King for Iowa's 4th District, raised $260,442 since his campaign launched on Jan. 9. King raised $61,666 between Jan. 1 and March 31.
Feenstra, of Hull, had some high-profile donors, including former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.
The primary challenge comes after a troubled few months for King. The Kiron Republican was quoted in a New York Times story asking, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
King, who has later said his words were misinterpreted, faced criticism from politicians and pundits from both parties for the comments. The backlash culminated in House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy removing King from his House committee assignments in January.
Feenstra's campaign capitalized on the controversy — and many national conservative voices pointed to his campaign online as a Republican alternative to King. Shapiro contributed $2,800 to Feenstra's campaign and encouraged others to do the same.
Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, gave $1,000 to King's challenger. As governor, Branstad had campaigned with King. Branstad has not publicly commented on King's recent comments, nor has he officially endorsed Feenstra.
Two other Republicans are also running for the nomination. Woodbury County supervisor Jeremy Taylor raised $57,928 during the time period and Bret Richards of Irwin raised $17,556 and took out $48,000 in loans.
But fundraising disparities haven't taken King down in previous elections. J.D. Scholten, a Democrat who ran for the 4th District seat last year, raised more than $3.2 million, where King raised just $876,229.
King won the race.
So far, King's campaign had spent $69,501 — $7,835 more than the campaign raised in the first few months of 2019. In comparison, Feenstra had spent just $20,758 as of March 31.
The representative also held a Pocahontas County town hall in Laurens at the town library Wednesday. He did not talk about his re-election campaign, but said he's worked with getting FEMA out to flooded areas and working to get funding for flooded areas in Iowa.
"Floods, in my opinion, are the worst kind of disaster," King said. "We're working to get the flood relief appropriations reliefs done. That got voted down in the U.S. Senate over a political tug-of-war over resources for Puerto Rico."
A spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency told the Register last week that funding packages currently under consideration in Congress would not have an impact on "the ongoing assistance being provided to affected individuals and local governments in Iowa as a result of the March flooding."

Why are you angry that Trump didn't collude?

Texto completo: Unless Attorney General William Barr just lied through his teeth to the entire world, special counsel Robert Mueller found "no evidence" that either President Trump or any of his associates conspired to collude or cooperated with the Russians in their attempt to interfere in the 2016 election.

This is objectively excellent news. It means that the leader of the free world for the last two years, love him or despise him, didn't commit the single worst crime a president can commit against his nation: treason.

So why are you so angry? Why are you actually sobbing into your body pillow, praying you make it until Rachel Maddow comes to comfort you tonight? Why are you breaking down into hysterics because our often childish, impatient, brash president didn't commit literal collusion with our number one geopolitical foe?

Well, apparently there's a lot of you having a bit of a meltdown today.

Texto completo: In 2011, I was invited to speak at a Rally for Information Freedom in New York City. I was invited by Barrett Brown, who was later sentenced to 63 months in prison for aiding hackers and obstructing authorities (he had faced up to 105 years); the media dubbed him "spokesman" for the hacker collective Anonymous. I spoke in defense of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who helped disseminate secret tapes of atrocities committed by U.S. forces in the Middle East.
The Lord of Flies nestled within America's intelligence establishment decided Mr. Assange must pay. He fled to the Ecuadorian embassy in London for sanctuary. Seven years later, he was arrested by British police.
A real-life Robin Hood, a Neo from "The Matrix," Mr. Assange follows the path of Geronimo and H. Rap Brown. He fights for us by revealing in black and white U.S. complicity in the torture and murder of innocents. Saving Mr. Assange is a battle everyone who loves freedom must join.
I have felt for years that the last defenders of our freedom would be the cyber-anarchists. We are not at freedom's end yet, but cameras capture the average Briton 300 times daily. The Lord of Flies even wishes to invade our minds, to determine when we are lying to him.
There is hope. Mathematical results with practical significance may enable us at least to transmit encrypted messages in such a way that only the intended recipients can decrypt them. This comes from the fact that it seems to be time-consuming to factor the product of two large prime numbers. For this reason, the Lord of Flies seeks to limit in essence the size of the prime numbers one can use for encryption - or provide a key to the back door for the government.
Punishing Mr. Assange is part of this effort to control us, Oceania-style. President Barack Obama's attorney general said that he wanted to "hold people accountable" - meaning Mr. Assange. Right-wing politicians and pundits have even called for the execution of the people behind WikiLeaks.
The British government, by arresting Mr. Assange, has disgraced itself and proven to the world it is America's toady. It is also violating European Union conventions, if it extradites a man to a place (America) where he could be executed.
Sweden has also disgraced itself. We know the real motivation of the Swedish government, which has wanted Mr. Assange for "questioning," is political, but, to smear his name, the actual crime they want to question him about is carnal, albeit not one that is a crime in the United States: A woman who had crawled into bed with Mr. Assange claimed he had relations with her without a prophylactic; another woman claimed she willingly had relations with Assange, but that he had removed the prophylactic.
Just imagine a man who got a woman pregnant telling a judge he doesn't owe child support because he thought the woman was taking birth control!
In truth, one of the women, after the alleged "crime," tweeted to the world that she was "with the world's coolest, smartest people!", referring to Mr. Assange, whom she was photographed with, smiling, also after the alleged "crime." It was only after one of the women discovered that Mr. Assange had recently had relations with the other woman that she tried to file charges.
Like so many public rape accusations, this is simply a case of a woman scorned (and one more reason he-said-she-said cases must be summarily dismissed, not summarily believed). The news media continue to broadcast the lie that Assange faces "rape" or "assault" charges, because the real goal is to defame Mr. Assange. It is not enough to kill him, because that makes him a martyr.
We must instead push back against those who seek to kill truth-tellers. In that way, perhaps we will succeed in saving the man who kicked the hornets' nest, and save what's left of our freedom along with him.

Texto completo: The plea from the @NetflixFilm Twitter account, that we all stop referring to romantic-comedies as “chick flicks,” might have some merit if the absolute ruin of the genre hadn’t already been completed by Amy Schumer.

“For starters, ‘chick flicks’ are traditionally synonymous with romantic comedies,” @NetflixFilm wrote on Monday. “This suggests that women are the only people interested in 1. Romance 2. Comedy. Which I can promise from the men I’ve come across in my life – simply isn’t true.” It added that the phrase “cheapens the work that goes into making these types of films” and that there’s nothing trivial about a movie “that makes you feel 1,000 emotions in ~90 minutes[.]”

This would have been true more than two decades ago. But neither Twitter nor Netflix were around then to give us the tea.

I loved romantic-comedies when they were good. Unfortunately, that run ended in 1997, with the best two of them all, “My Best Friend’s Wedding,” starring Julia Roberts and then-little-known Cameron Diaz; and “As Good as it Gets,” with Jack Nicholson, Hellen Hunt, and Cuba Gooding Jr., who had just come off of his stellar performance in “Jerry Maguire” (another fantastic rom-com from the year before).

The category’s cratering started immediately thereafter. If you saw boring Jennifer Lopez in 2002’s “Maid in Manhattan,” you know exactly what I'm talking about. Hollywood decided that writing, originality and even acting were no longer necessary to make a profit on a rom-com. Simply microwave an old plot with an offensively cheesy script and call it a day.

The rom-com has never recovered it. There was some potential with Katherine Heigl in “27 Dresses” (2008) but then she starred in “The Ugly Truth” (2009), a movie I walked out on in the theater after 25 minutes, because it was that bad.

The fall of the rom-com reached its conclusion with Amy Schumer, who almost single-handedly has made the category earn the “chick flick” reputation. Schumer’s movies are for no one but women — usually plus-sized women needing a confidence boost.

“Trainwreck” of 2015 tells the story of promiscuous big-girl lush Schumer deciding to settle down, every bit of the riot that it sounds. Her 2018 movie “I Feel Pretty” features Schumer as a self-conscious professional who, after an accident, sees herself as a knock-out blonde. Spoiler: By the end, she sees her true beauty is within, a plot twist you certainly didn't see coming.

What about either of these would make anyone, let alone a man, “feel 1,000 emotions”? I feel precisely one and it hurts.

It’s offensive even to think of handing my money over for a genre that has long sucked, capped by Schumer’s, to cite the New York Times' oxymoron, “feminist humor.”

These aren't movies. They’re messages about body positivity and female empowerment. Gag. It's not romantic comedy. It’s social justice.

Julia Roberts in “My Best Friend’s Wedding” is a fabulous and successful restaurant critic, resentful toward only herself that the man she let get away has found someone else. Jack Nicholson in “As Good as it Gets” is a multi-bestselling romance author wracked by obsessive-compulsive disorder, who falls in love with a no-nonsense waitress. In sharp contrast, Schumer is either a serial alcohol abuser whose mess you're supposed to enjoy, or an anxious neurotic whom you’re supposed to pity.

Which one of these doesn’t sound like a positive story for women?

Netflix would have been right about the strength and appeal of rom-coms if this were 1997. But it’s 2019 and we’re stuck with Amy Schumer.

What separates Assange from the ranks of real journalists

Texto completo: They say that guests are like fish; after three days they become a bit whiffy. By this measure, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange smelled like an overladen fishing vessel adrift in the searing sun.
Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador’s interior minister.
Assange’s behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.
If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he’s a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans — including many in the U.S. media — long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.
No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange’s publishing activities.
Then again, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion.
While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first?
The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, The Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone’s personal emails and under what circumstances? One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn’t accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.
In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government’s decadeslong campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to The New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.
In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham’s bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts — all while risking great personal and financial loss — was epic.
Assange’s process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.
On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole — and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal — and he published. The difference may be mostly political.
The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg’s charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.
WikiLeaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.
One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk." Then again, maybe that’s just me.

Texto completo: Reduce rape kit processing times
We need a law passed by the Legislature to force a government agency to do their job in a reasonable and efficient manner.
Our wives, girlfriends, daughters, granddaughters, and others are physically and emotionally violated in the worst possible way, and we ho-hum our way down the road for the past four years.
How can this still be an unresolved problem? What is more important then the safety of the women in our society who are our wives, daughters and mothers? How can we not use contractor firms to catch us up on rape kit testing? How can we be squabbling over money on an issue like this? For 10 years some of these tests have been sitting on the shelf awaiting attention; how can this be acceptable in anyone's mind?
“We can't really put a price tag on justice, especially on cases of sexual assault,” said Brittany Gregory from the Attorney General's Office. But money is the whole issue. Provide the money, the problem gets solved quickly.

Cheers for Senate Bill 5116
Progress is coming to Clark County. Gov. Jay Inslee's requested legislation for 100 percent clean electricity, Senate Bill 5116, has passed both chambers in the Legislature.
Senate Bill 5116 will permit Clark Public Utilities to invest in more cost-effective conservation projects. The goal is to gradually reduce pollution from our power plant. Doing so will help protect our children's future. We have huge opportunities for conservation in schools and commercial buildings. Instead of sending millions each year to Canada for their natural gas, we'll use that money to create jobs locally in conservation and renewable energy.
Cheers to Inslee for his leadership, and to Sen. Annette Cleveland and Reps. Sharon Wylie and Monica Stonier for supporting SB 5116. Cheers also to the staff at Port of Vancouver for researching options for a climate action plan. Now we need the cities in Clark County to do the same.

Build another bridge
There is no question that the Interstate 5 Bridge is not capable of handling current traffic capacity. Replacing it with a new bridge (including dedicated public transportation lanes) is needed, but any new bridge will soon be backed up as employers move west of Portland. Therefore, a third route north/south freeway will be needed, serving Hillsboro and Beaverton. A route off U.S. Route 26 in Oregon, at Cornelius Pass Road, either straight across to Northwest 119th Street, to I-5, or travel north along the east side of the Columbia River then east at Lewis River to I-5. There would be no trouble boosting the crossing to allow for tall river traffic at either location.

Democrats morose and sullen
In all my days I have not seen a more morose and sullen group than the cabal consisting of Democratic Party leaders, members of Obama's administration, and the so-called mainstream media led by CNN and the New York Times. Have you ever seen Jerry Nadler smile? Or James Clapper, John Brennan, Andrew McCabe, Richard Blumenthal or Cory Booker? Then there's the liar's club led by Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, insisting they saw evidence of Trump's collusion. Maxine Waters and James Comey form a league of their own.
It appears their sole purpose in life is to excoriate, obstruct, and impeach President Trump. Can you imagine the mindset that requires? How can they not suffer perpetual depression while in their continual rant, exhibiting a permanent snarl. Harboring such levels of venom and hate is remarkable. Why aren't they spending their time formulating legislation benefiting Americans instead? Even if President Trump wasn't a jerk and a cad, having beat the cabal's candidate, Hillary Clinton, would be enough for their eternal excoriation.
Their day will come when real investigations into fake FISA warrants and other illegal activities occur as Devin Nunes' referrals will detail. With what went on before Trump's election, does anyone believe that Obama was above it all?

PULITZER PRIZE WINNER PLUMBS IMPACT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM IN ELEGANT DEFENSE'

Texto completo: The biological system charged with preserving human life, diversity and reproduction is also the instrument that will kill the majority of us.
It's one of the paradoxes that fascinates Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Matt Richtel in his new book, "An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of The Immune System" (William Morrow, $28.99, 409 pages).
The San Francisco-based Richtel has written several thrillers, but his first nonfiction outing, 2014's "A Deadly Wandering," about distracted driving, combined compelling human narratives with in-depth science writing. He is a reporter for The New York Times, the creator and former writer of the daily comic strip "Rudy Park" and has appeared on NPR and "PBS NewsHour."
Subtitled "A Tale in Four Lives," "Elegant Defense" examines the immune system's history and future through the lens of science, records and research and the case histories of four individuals. It describes the wide umbrella of the immune system's astonishing domain: HIV, diabetes, asthma, colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, cancer, infections, fever, overprescribed antibiotics, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and other vital components. Despite the topic's staggering complexity and the extensive information in Richtel's fact-filled coverage, the heart and fine craft of a storyteller emerges most memorably throughout the book.
"I love fiction," Richtel said. "I deeply appreciate story that moves. I love nonfiction when it has momentum. When I read a book that's dryly factual, one that feels more like white paper than story, I cannot engage with it."
Richtel's book includes the personal accounts of two women who suffer hard-to-diagnose autoimmune diseases, a miracle HIV survivor and Jason Greenstein, a close friend of Richtel's whose episodic battle with cancer entails both a celebratory "festival of life" and a grim foreshadowing of inevitable mortality.
"What the stories do is show you the nuance; what science looks like in real life. They're my favorite parts to write," Richtel said.
The emotions and struggles of the people featured in his book are a "big crayon box of colors," Richtel said, and their stories "exploded" into his hands and helped flesh out the science.
"I get to see that everybody is their own Ferrari. Science takes me under the hood, but first I get to see them drive, hear them sing their own opera," he said.
It's not accidental that Richtel, a guitar player and songwriter, mentions music. Self-described as "scrappy and fiercely joyful" in his nonwriting pursuits tennis, singing, espresso-drinking and activities with his wife, Stanford neurologist Meredith Barad, and their two children Richtel finds his greatest bliss in words well chosen, spartan language that avoids cliches and celebrates storytelling.
"Whether I write a song or prose, I'm trying to have the language be consistent with the story, engaging to the audience, but reflective of the core emotion I'm trying to communicate," he said.
Recalling childhood years in Boulder, Colorado, he finds possible origins for his interest in the immune system and wellness. Richtel's father ran marathons and favored trail mix, he said, and "I had a mom who was an insanely early adopter of what is now seen as a very thoughtful approach to health. In two words: carob chips. We didn't have sugar, soda. She thought eating healthy, getting rest were extremely important. She only violated that herself by buying double stuff Oreos and sneak-eating them at night. We'd conduct special ops searches for them."
In the new book, Richtel tells not merely facts about the immune system, but how it plays out for him and in the lives of Jason, Bob, Linda and Merredith. "The narrative arc of the book is that we all die," he said. "That scares the publisher because what sells books is, I'm going to tell you to eat this one thing, and you're going to live longer.' This book isn't the magic pill. I offer the reader a bitter pill. How to live with more peace and happiness, but not forever. The stories are about the realness of living and, in some cases, dying."
Which is not to say Richtel avoids offering advice: foremost is getting enough sleep. "If there's a single tool you have, it's sleep. It can take its toll if you compromise it," he warns. Also, handle raw meat cautiously, due to its many pathogens; avoid super-boosting the immune system, which can trigger autoimmunity, allergies and other diseases; engage in exercise; follow a balanced diet and practice stress reduction.
Up next for Richtel is "The Man Who Wouldn't Die," a comedic neo-noir novel set in San Francisco and so unusual that William Morrow will publish it in August under a pen name, A.B. Jewell. "They said We love it, but it doesn't fit your brand,' whatever that means, so they'll use a pen name. I said, Hey, have a ball.' "
When beginning a new project, he says he must believe "I will create something brilliant," but he can only proceed by telling himself repeatedly that whatever comes out will be fine. How it's received isn't of ultimate importance. Writing, he says, is acknowledging the divine spark of life, then allowing it to run freely.

NEW YORK - The South Florida Sun Sentinel and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won Pulitzer Prizes on Monday and were recognized along with the Capital Gazette of Maryland for their coverage of the horrifying mass shootings in 2018 at a high school, a synagogue and a newsroom itself.
The Associated Press won in the international reporting category for documenting the humanitarian horrors of Yemen's civil war, while the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal were honored for delving into President Donald Trump's finances and breaking open the hush-money scandals involving two women who said they had affairs with him.
The Florida paper received the Pulitzer in public service for its coverage of the massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and for detailing the shortcomings in school discipline and security that contributed to the carnage.
The Post-Gazette was honored in the breaking news category for its reporting on the synagogue rampage that left 11 people dead.
After the Pulitzer announcement, the newsroom in Pittsburgh observed a moment of silence for the victims.
At the Sun Sentinel, too, the staff took in the award in a sober spirit. "We're mindful of what it is that we won for," Editor-in-Chief Julie Anderson said. "There are still families grieving, so it's not joy, it's almost  I don't know how to describe it. We're emotional, as well."
So, too, at the Capital Gazette, which was given a special citation for its coverage and courage in the face of a massacre in its own newsroom. The Pulitzer board also gave the paper a $100,000 grant to further its journalism.
"Clearly, there were a lot of mixed feelings," editor Rick Hutzell said. "No one wants to win an award for something that kills five of your friends."
The Annapolis-based newspaper published on schedule, with some help from the Baltimore Sun, the day after five staffers were shot and killed in one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in U.S. history. The man charged had a long-standing grudge against the paper.

OUR DISGRACE AT THE BORDER THE AGONY OF THE REFUGEE AND THE POSTURING OF SHOWBIZ POLITICIANS

Texto completo: Suppose one night there is a knock on your door. You open it to find 100 bedraggled families shivering in your yard - exhausted, filthy, terrified. The first cry of your heart would be to take them in, but you'd know there were too many. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="8757">
But you'd still do something. You'd rally your neighbors and the local authorities and put some system in place - some way to provide immediate care, figure out who these people were and how, within your means, you could lift them up.
And this is precisely what the U.S. has failed to do in handling the refugees who are flooding across the southern border. There is nothing remotely like an adequate system in place to handle the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing violence in Central America or seeking economic opportunity. And there is no prospect of a plan being put in place from either Republicans or Democrats.
And in that way the border crisis is paradigmatic of our politics right now. Both parties are content to adopt abstract ideological postures. Neither is interested in creating a functioning system that balances trade-offs and actually works. In the age of Trump, national politics is showbiz - self-righteous performance art to make the base feel good about itself.
The Trump show is all about toughness and cruelty. The administration adopted a zero-tolerance policy that was supposed to deter potential immigrants. It failed miserably. Roughly 103,000 unauthorized immigrants reached the U.S.-Mexico border in March, twice as many as in March 2018.
Aside from baring his fangs, President Donald Trump is uninterested in processing the extra refugees. The facilities are overwhelmed. Over 800,000 people already have their cases pending. New asylum seekers are held for a couple of weeks, dumped out on the streets, and most will wait until 2021 to get their formal hearings. My colleagues Michael Shear, Miriam Jordan and Manny Fernandez cite the words officials are using to describe the situation: "operational emergency,""systemwide meltdown," "the system is on fire."
The field is wide open for the Democrats to come forth with a decent plan. But on many issues the 2020 Democrats aren't really having a primary campaign; they're having a purity test. The candidates are not sure if they can deviate from wherever the social media warriors have defined the leftward edge. So the Democratic show consists of indignant generalities intended to sound radical while changing nothing.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="8764">
Many Democrats in Congress are denying there even is a crisis on the border. The only Democratic candidate with an immigration plan so far is Julián Castro, who wants to repeal a 1929 provision that made illegal entry a federal crime. Others gesture toward the open border crowd with policies like eliminating ICE. This is Trumpian extremism reversed.
Immigration is one of those issues on which the extreme positions are wrong, because the correct answer means balancing competing goods.
On the one hand, these people are our neighbors. Many of them come to us with harrowing stories of husbands murdered, daughters raped, mass extortion. It's our obligation and joy to reach out to them with a hand of solidarity. It's barbarism to send them back to lawlessness.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="8768">
On the other hand, many who are coming across seeking asylum do not qualify for it. When they get their hearings, only 20 percent win the right to stay in the United States because they'd face persecution in their home countries. Many come for traditional economic reasons. The murder rate in El Salvador has fallen in half since 2015, while the number of asylum seekers has skyrocketed.
The U.S. cannot take in everybody who wants to come. So the first task is to set priorities. The victims of violence and persecution get top priority, then those being systemically denied their basic rights because their country has become a failed state, then those seeking economic betterment.
Then you create a system to implement those priorities. Over the short term do the things any practical mayor would do: build new detention centers at the border; expand the capacities at the ports of entry; expand the number of judge teams, to speed through the backlog; create an orderly release procedure coordinated with humanitarian agencies; increase the number of counselors so refugees can navigate the system; vet children in their home countries for refugee status so they don't have to make a fruitless trip.
Over the long term, you help build better police and justice systems in the home countries. You cooperate with Mexico to jointly tackle this challenge we face together. You might shift to a more skills-based immigration system while increasing the number of refugees we take in each year.
Designing a practical response that wins widespread support is, in theory, not hard. But it requires starting with a certain question: What can we do to help them? Much of today's politics starts from a different question: What posture can I adopt that will reflect well on me? What can I say to prove I'm manly or woke?
This is what happens when the politics of practical action get replaced by the politics of performative narcissism.

Could a blaze like that happen in metro Detroit?

Texto completo: Monday's devastating fire at historic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris shocked two nationally prominent firefighting experts — both in metro Detroit — as well as a church official with the Archdiocese of Detroit.
In interviews with the Free Press, they talked about the fire in Paris and whether anything like the Notre Dame disaster could happen here. Answers have been edited for clarity.
Detroit Deputy Fire Commissioner Dave Fornell Fornell has been a consultant to the New York City Fire Department, where he still holds the rank of honorary battalion chief, and has worked in Boston, Chicago, Memphis and other departments. In his varied career, Fornell also has been an editor at the New York Times.
Question: How vulnerable are metro Detroit's big churches right now?
Answer: You're really talking apples and oranges. In Detroit, sure, we could get a fire in a church anytime. Detroit has what I call mini-Notre Dames.
But we have very, very vigorous inspection schedules. Now, a lot of these older churches are grandfathered in (with outdated building codes). You just can't go in there and demand putting sprinkler heads in there. But all of our churches are required to have extinguishers, alarms systems and clear means of egress.
Q: Do firefighters factor in the historic nature of a structure that's on fire or do they just have to fight it like any other fire?
A: We are just as aggressive in somebody's house as we are at a church. We want to save that building.
Q: How does firefighting differ between and Paris and typical American cities like Detroit?
A: All the hydrants over there are under the street. They have to lift up the pavement to get at them. And our water systems are generally more robust than in Europe.
Ned McGrath, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Detroit Q: Does the Archdiocese have an official comment on the Paris fire?
A: Archbishop Allen Vigneron, who is of French heritage, issued this statement on Monday: "We in the Archdiocese of Detroit unite our prayers to the many Catholics around the world and the Archdiocese of Paris regarding the news of the horrific fire at Notre Dame Cathedral. This holy site has been a place of pilgrimage and prayer for millions of people."
Ex-Farmington Hills fire chief Rick Marinucci Marinucci, past president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, is now executive director of the Fire Department Safety Officers Association that sets nationwide standards.
Q: Europe's cathedrals have walls of stone. So what burned at Notre Dame?
A: These huge old buildings actually have a tremendous amount of wood, including giant roof beams, interior partitions, storage areas, pews and more. "And there was no consideration for fire safety when these cathedrals were constructed" — that is, no "fire stops" that are inserted into a building's design, aimed at containing fires to limited areas.

Trump builds fundraising lead over Democrats

Texto completo: President Trump's latest campaign fundraising haul highlights the growing financial dominance of the president's reelection machine over a crowded Democratic field that is still taking shape.
In the first three months of 2019, Trump's campaign and two affiliated committees raised $39 million, records made public Monday show - his best fundraising quarter since his election, according to the campaign and federal records.
That brings the sum raised by his 2020 campaign and the two committees to $168 million, the most ever raised by an incumbent president at this point.
The 16 Democratic primary candidates who began raising money in the first quarter together brought in $89.5 million from Jan. 1 until March 31, according to Federal Election Commission records made public Monday night. At this point in the 2008 election cycle, eight Democratic candidates had raised $85.4 million.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) reported the biggest haul last quarter, with $18.2 million, followed by $12 million raised by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and $9.4 million collected by former congressman Beto O'Rourke (Tex.). Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., raised $7 million - a large amount for a newcomer to national politics.
Four U.S. senators trailed Buttigieg: Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts ($6 million), Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota ($5.2 million), Cory Booker of New Jersey ($5.1 million) and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York ($3 million).
Behind them were businessman Andrew Yang ($2.4 million); Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ($2.3 million); former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper ($2.2 million); Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii ($2 million); author Marianne Williamson ($1.5 million); former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro ($1.1 million); and Wayne Messam, mayor of Miramar, Fla. ($43,531).
Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland reported a $12.1 million haul but had loaned himself $11.7 million of that amount.
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign and two affiliated committees spent more money than they raised in the first quarter of 2019, spending $47.5 million. Nearly $3 million of the expenses went to American Made Media Consultants. The firm was created by the campaign to purchase digital, radio and television advertisements, according to the New York Times.
The campaign spent about $700,000 on Parscale Strategy, a consulting firm run by Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, records show. The committees spent $351,017 at Trump properties, including $214,944 at Mar-a-Lago by Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee.
Democratic strategists acknowledge Trump has built a formidable reelection operation with a large war chest. Trump's campaign and two affiliated fundraising committees entered April with $49 million in cash, Federal Election Commission records show.
But Democrats said a fundraising advantage does not necessarily translate to victory, noting that Trump was outraised by GOP rivals and by Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Joel Benenson, who served as a top strategist for the campaigns of Clinton and President Barack Obama, said fundraising will pick up once front-runners emerge.
"Nobody would contest that there are advantages to incumbents," he said, adding that Trump has ramped up his fundraising through tweets and rallies that galvanize his base.
"The challenge for Democratic candidates is how much grass-roots activism support" will coalesce around their candidacy, Benenson added.
For now, Trump's fundraising pace is giving him an edge over the large pool of Democratic challengers that will take months for them to match.
Unlike past presidents, Trump began building his reelection machine shortly after taking office, bombarding supporters with fundraising solicitations and whipping up supporters at Make America Great Again rallies.
That has helped drive a large stream of donations that his campaign and the Republican National Committee are using to expand their volunteer programs across the country and develop a massive data operation.
The Trump campaign was among the largest political spenders on Facebook and Google advertisements during the 2018 cycle, according to a study by Tech for Campaigns, a group that helps Democratic candidates with digital outreach. That gives it the opportunity to constantly improve its ability to target and persuade voters online while some Democratic candidates are still hiring digital staff.
Trump has tapped into both a loyal base of small- dollar donors and wealthy backers who are giving six-figure contributions to his campaign and the party. In addition, his allies are raising large donations for the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action and other big-money groups.
That provides the president an added boost over Democrats, who are facing pressure from voters on the left to eschew support from wealthy donors and super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited money. About 55 percent of the money the campaign and affiliated committees raised in the first quarter came from donations under $200, FEC records show.
The focus by Democrats on low-dollar online donations has increased the pressure to hit their fundraising goals through texts, emails and tweets. Average online donations reported by campaigns ranged from $18 to $43.

Texto completo: As with presidential candidates before him, I believe Donald Trump should have made his tax returns public. But it was his choice.

Trump was elected even though he refused to release his tax returns. Obviously, not that many Americans cared enough about it to let his decision influence their vote. And that gives Trump's decision democratic legitimacy.

As Democrats strive to access and publicize Trump's tax returns, it becomes increasingly clear that everyone's tax privacy is in danger, as the political Left is increasingly eager to abolish it. On Saturday, for example, the New York Times' Binyamin Appelbaum argued for the mandatory release of all tax returns. Appelbaum and Democrats are wrong here.

For a start, were Trump to have committed any tax crimes in relation to his returns, he would have been charged by the IRS.

Appelbaum's broader suggestion is that all tax returns should be made public. He says that "disclosure could help to ensure that people pay a fair share of taxes. Americans underpay their taxes by more than $450 billion each year, more than 10% of total federal revenue. Publishing a list of millionaires who paid little or no taxes this year could significantly reduce the number of millionaires who pay little or no taxes next year."

The choice of words belies the central problem of his proposal. Note Appelbaum's implicit class-bias suggestion that the rich are cheating everyone else and must be held to the fiery light of justice. Is this true? Not at all.

The data show that the highest earning 20% of income taxpayers account for 87% of all federal income tax revenue. The idea, then, that "the rich" do not pay enough taxes is a stretch of both mathematics and the concept of fairness. The same data also show that these Americans pay more in income taxes than their share of national income. Remember that next time you see left-wing moralizing over tax fairness.

But the issue here isn't ultimately one of fairness in taxes paid. It's the question of government versus individual freedom and privacy. Appelbaum says that "Calling for more disclosure may seem discordant at a time of growing concern about privacy. But income taxation is an act of government, not an aspect of private life."

Again, he's wrong — as wrong as he would be in demanding that Medicare and Medicaid release the medical records of all the patients using those programs, or publish everyone's Social Security number for that matter. After all, these are all acts of government, are they not?

Yes, income taxation is an act of government. We should support efficient tax collection and effective enforcement against tax evasion. But income tax returns are rightly regarded by law as aspects of private life. After all, they speak not simply to earnings made by life choices, but also to deep personal questions such as debt, loans, medical bills, children, inheritance — intimate questions of family and identity. These are things that culture and jurisprudence have, until now at least, regarded as private matters deserving of public protection. Government only gets permission to ask about these things because it promises to safeguard our answers.

To its credit, the IRS feels the same way. Note how, amid all the great media attention over Trump's tax returns, those returns have not been leaked. The agency clearly recognizes that the principle of protecting private information is fundamental to its reputation as a responsible public servant.

There's also the question of where this ends. Appelbaum says his idea would promote moral good, but I suggest it has more likelihood of promoting the vice of envy, tax avoidance and evasion, and capital evacuation. Moreover, Appelbaum's principle could be extended much further. If all millionaire income tax returns must be released, then why not all their emails (maybe they are hiding business deals)? Why not their vacation expenses (maybe they are spending vast ill-gotten sums abroad)? Why not their children's income taxes (maybe the parents are subsidizing entrenchment of wealth)?

There's no reasonable limiting principle here. It's a slippery slope toward 1984.

Appelbaum concludes that "The question is whether Americans are willing to endure a little sunlight in the interest of fairness and equality."

But no, a little more sunlight is not always good thing. There's a reason we put doors on our bathrooms and curtains on our bedroom windows, even if everyone has some vague idea of what we do in those places.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Ga. - Tiger Woods faced this question: Should Jack Nicklaus be worried about his record 18 majors?
"Well, I don't know if he's worried or not," Woods replied, later adding: "I'm just enjoying 15."
Perhaps he'd also enjoy these 15 takeaways from one of the most memorable Masters in history:
1. This place always delivers. Sunday drama at the Masters is a given. The risk-reward holes on the back nine lend themselves to "ooohs" and "aaahs" every year. Dustin Johnson picked up four shots on the back nine Sunday. Francesco Molinari crumbled, putting two balls in the water.
Masters officials lengthened the fifth hole and got what they wanted, we suppose. Woods bogeyed the hole all four days. But they'd be wise to think twice before moving the tee box back at No. 13, which yielded 17 crowd-pleasing eagles this week.
2. Woods' dissection of his thought process on the 155-yard 12th was epic. "I had 147 over the first tongue in the bunker, so my number was 150. I saw Brooks (Koepka) ended up short. (Ian Poulter) ended up short as well. I was up there on the tee box and I could feel that wind puff up a little bit. Brooksy is stronger than I am, and he flights it better than I do, so I'm sure he hit 9-iron but didn't make it. So I knew my 9-iron couldn't cover the flag. I said: Just be committed. Hit it over that tongue. Let get out of here (with par) and let's go handle the par 5s, and I did."
3. Masters officials had a spectacular week (Part 1). The women's amateur event was well attended and shined a light on the progress the club has made since former Chairman Hootie Johnson's "point of a bayonet" clash with Martha Burk. Champion Jennifer Kupcho won in epic fashion, with an eagle on 13 and birdies on three of her final four holes.
4. Masters officials had a spectacular week (Part 2). Because of the threat of severe weather, they moved up Sunday's start time and had players go off both the first and 10th tees. By the time the weather horn sounded at 2:52 p.m., calling for the evacuation of the course, Woods had received his green jacket from Patrick Reed.
5. Woods has won green jacketsin 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005 and 2019, joining Nicklaus as the only men to win the Masters in three decades.
6. Asked to describe his impact on golf, Woods said he has brought more youth to the game. And encouraged players to improve their conditioning.
"A lot of the guys on the tour now are training," he said. "They are getting bigger, stronger, faster, more athletic. They are hitting the ball prodigious distances, and a little bit of that's probably attributed to what I did. When I first turned pro, I was the only one in the gym, except Vijay (Singh)."
7. And now for the ribbing. "Now everyone trains," he said. "Even Phil (Mickelson) is working out. Things have come a long way."
8. Chew on this. Mickelson told the New York Times last month that he likes to chew gum while playing to boost cognitive functioning.
Woods chewed much of the week but for a different reason: "I'm chomping on this gum because I usually get hungry, I keep eating so much. And it curbs my appetite a little bit, which is nice. The issue I have at tournaments is I lose so much weight."
9. Viktor Hovland of Norway was low amateur, finishing at 3 under.
10. Rickie Fowler remains the best player never to have won a major. He got close again Sunday, finishing T-9.
"I love this place," he said. "I've got a jacket coming soon, just not this year. I know I can get it done here."
11. Woods received $2,070,000 for his victory. A Woods fan did almost as well. The William Hill sportsbook had an $85,000 wager on Woods at 14-1, resulting in a $1.19 million payout.
"It's a painful day for William Hill - our biggest golf loss ever - but a great day for golf," company official Nick Bogdanovich told VSiN.com.
12. Woods' kids (daughter Sam, 11, and son Charlie, 10) might have a love/hate relationship with golf. "Prior to the comeback," Woods said, "they only knew that golf caused me a lot of pain. If I tried to swing a club, I would be on the ground. I struggled for years.
"Now I think they're starting to understand how much the game means to me."
13. Woods was steaming as he came off the fourth green after back-to-back bogeys. Asked about his conversation with caddie Joe LaCava, Woods said: "The talk that we had ... I just listened. He said some things that I can't really repeat here. Then I went into the restroom and proceeded to say the same things over and over to myself and then came out and I felt a lot better."
14. Several non-winners can take pride in their results. Patrick Cantlay (T-9) and Tony Finau (T-5) threatened. And Jordan Spieth finally showed a pulse, shooting 75-68-69-71. "Progress," said Spieth, who is in the midst of his worst season. "If it weren't for those first nine holes (Thursday), I probably would have a chance to win."
15. Tiger will not reach 18 majors.That's my prediction. Why? While it's true he contended at the final two majors last year, Augusta National is the one course that's perfect for him. The 43-year-old Woods doesn't pay much of a price for errant tee shots such as Sunday misses on Nos. 2 and 11, and he puts his 20-plus years of course knowledge to use.
That said, he does know Bethpage Black well. The course on Long Island, N.Y., will host the PGA Championship next month as part of the reconfigured schedule.
Woods won the 2002 U.S. Open there and tied for sixth in the 2009 Open.

Texto completo: David Brooks has won a following as a moderate conservative on the op-ed page of The New York Times and also as the polite and thoughtful sparring partner of liberal Mark Shields on "PBS NewsHour" each Friday evening.
Now, with his book "The Second Mountain," Brooks may find still more fans -- among philosophers, preachers, marriage counselors and other unlikely target audiences for book publishers.
About those mountains … Brooks sees two types in our lives, one bad, the other good. As he puts it:
"If the first mountain is about building up the ego and defining the self, the second mountain is about shedding the ego and losing the self. If the first mountain is about acquisition, the second mountain is about contribution. If the first mountain is elitist -- moving up -- the second mountain is egalitarian -- planting yourself amid those who need, and walking arm in arm with them."
He adds: "On the first mountain you tend to be ambitious, strategic, and independent. On the second mountain you tend to be relational, intimate, and relentless."
In this book, which follows 2015's "The Road to Character," Brooks moves readers down that first mountain and up the second, reaching into history for some shining examples. One is Etty Hillesum, a Jewish woman in the Netherlands during World War II. Despite the peril, she stuck around to help others in need -- until the Holocaust finally caught up with her.
As a first-mountain example, he cites among others six Israeli day care centers in Haifa that "realized they had a problem. Parents kept arriving late at pick-up time, so the teachers had to hang around an extra hour or so until the kids were gone. To address the issue, the day care centers began imposing fines on parents who were late. The plan backfired. The share of parents who arrived late doubled. Before, picking up your kids on time was an act of consideration toward the teachers -- a moral responsibility. Afterward, it became an economic transaction; you perform the service of looking after my kid and I pay you for it. In the former people are thinking in terms of right and wrong, being considerate or inconsiderate. In the latter, a cost-benefit calculation kicks in. What's best for me?"
Brooks suggests that those who climb the second mountain build closer and better communities. Or something like that. Despite his skill with words, Brooks chooses to write most of this book in abstract prose -- and despite the author's strong case for community, the reader's eyes may start glazing over. A sample:
"In the early 1960s our culture began to embrace a hyper-individualistic way of life to help it address the problems of that moment. But after a few decades, that culture, taken to the extreme, produced its own crisis.
"The grand narrative of individual emancipation left us with what some have called 'the great disembedding.' Whereas before people tended to be enmeshed in tight communities with prescribed social norms that sometimes seemed stifling, now they are cut loose. Whereas once they served in hierarchical institutions with prescribed social norms that sometimes seemed stifling, now they have trouble thinking institutionally at all -- how to live within an institution, steward an institution, and reform an institution -- so the quality of our social organizations that make up our common life decays.
"Most of all, hyper-individualism has led to a society when people live further and further apart from one another -- socially, emotionally, even physically."
Three-hundred-plus pages of prose like that makes for a long, long sermon. (Still, grammatical purists can stay alert for slip-ups and remind Brooks, among other things, that "none" takes a singular verb.)
Finally, some readers will be dismayed -- while others will be relieved -- that nowhere in this book does Brooks write the name "Trump."

Texto completo: “I’d die and go to hell before selling an annuity” (to you or anyone).
You may have seen me on my firm’s long-running TV ads saying that. Over the top? Yep!
That bluntness aims to cut through the soft, misleading, and in my opinion, near-criminal “guarantees” annuity firms have peddled for decades – to investors’ detriment. Whatever you think an annuity can do for you, it can’t. Or there is likely a cheaper, better, more flexible way to do it.
Note: I’m not referring to simple immediate “fixed” annuities that convert one lump sum to income. Those can be OK, done right. But deferred annuities – “variables,” “indexed” and “deferred fixed” – are bogus. Here, you upfront cash for a contract that pays later. Meanwhile, your principal contract value supposedly grows.
Auto Show in NYC:These 6 new technologies will transform vehicles
Bed Bath Gone:Chain plans to close at least 40 stores this year but open 15 new locations
They’re usually marketed as safe investments, with guaranteed income, when you’re ready. Most buyers never see the truth. It’s buried in huge, complex, jargon-filled contracts that normal folks can’t understand without a dictionary, gallons of coffee and a claimant’s lawyer. Few read them.
Sales reps, (many well-intended), believe in annuities but are paid handsomely to blind-eye reality. Why? A single, big sale can fund a year at Yale for his or her child. Some say, “Yes there are bad ones, but I find the good ones for you. ” It’s almost always untrue. The pitfalls are legion.
Consider “variable” annuities, the slow-killer cigarettes of investing. First, fees are nose-bleed-high, almost always, combining upfront and hidden commissions. Firms pitch them as safe, high returns – capital preservation plus growth. Horsepucky!
Variables buy stock and bond funds, fluctuating with volatile markets. Those funds typically charge high fees. Then add insurance fees, contract fees, fees for riders – say, life insurance or fancy income “benefits” offering dubious value. You likely never can figure out the full fees. Typically, they’re America’s most expensive investment products – plus low returns.
It’s absolutely better, long-term, to own low-cost stock and bond funds directly – while building a sensible retirement cash flow plan. It’s loads cheaper, has hugely higher returns and is more flexible. If you need life insurance, just buy an inexpensive term policy (see my March 17 column).
“Indexed” annuities are loosely linked to stock market indexes. Their pitch: Get stocks’ upside without the downside – with little to no fees. But the upside is severely limited. Returns usually omit dividends. Then, most use a “participation rate,” providing just part of the index’s return. If the index rises 10%, your participation rate is 50%, your return is 5%. The insurer keeps the rest.
These often include “performance caps” – maximums you get in any month, quarter or year. Problem: Stock returns bounce big time. Envision a 10-percent annual cap. You miss most of all the bigger up years – which is where most of history’s gains come from. Monthly caps are even deadlier. Again, you miss big "up" months, like recently. Long-term, these annuity returns often look like fat-fee Certificates of Deposit (CDs).
"Deferred fixed” annuities offer steady returns for a set period. But the rate is low, and it can reset at the insurer’s discretion. It becomes like an expensive restricted version of a CD. Ditching a CD is easy. Ditching a fixed annuity usually suffers stiff penalties and, potentially, a tax hit. Whatever you need, annuities are probably wrong.
Yes, my advice is conflicted – my firm often helps people exit deferred annuities. My opinion remains, regardless. All but simple immediate fixed annuities should be outlawed because buyers almost always misunderstand what they’re buying. It’s one step from fraud. Everyone deserves more transparent and flexible investments.

Texto completo: There's an old saying in the boxing world: "Champions don't become champions in the ring, they are merely recognized there." The implication, of course, is that hard work, day after day, in the cold gym is what enables a fighter to win.
This makes sense in many areas of life. "Sweat more in practice, bleed less in war," is the basis of the Spartan Warrior Credo, circa 750 BC. "Chance favors the prepared mind," is an oft-echoed soundbite from legendary scientist Louis Pasteur.
But how does the notion of preparation apply today, in our complex, tech-enabled, busy lives? How can it drive meaningful business results? Could a thoughtful pre-game strategy fuel better outcomes?
There are nine key questions that elite business leaders, star athletes and top musicians ask themselves before important performances in order to prepare themselves to win.
Try asking yourself these same questions before your next important sales call, presentation to investors, team meeting, customer visit, or brainstorming session:
1. What is single most important desired outcome?
2. Why does this outcome matter so much?
3. What are the top three biggest threats to achieving the outcome?
4. What are the top three distraction triggers that could lure you off focus?
5. Who needs to support you to drive your desired result?
6. Who is most likely to get in your way?
7. What is the shortest path to the result?
8. What smaller wins need to happen along the way in order to land your bigger objective?
9. How will you know when you've achieved victory?
This simple pre-game ritual will help prepare you for success by cycling through the possibilities in advance to formulate your best strategy. Instead of winging it, you'll be focused, armed for battle, and ready to achieve.
Certainly practicing your craft, doing your homework, or double-checking your gear are critical factors of preparation. But the mental exercise of playing out the match in advance is another important step that can tilt the odds in your favor.
Get your head in the game far before the game begins, and you'll enjoy a much higher probability of victory.

TAPPING INTO 21ST-CENTURY POPULISM

Texto completo: Eugene Victor Debs left school at the age of 14, to scrape paint and grease off the cars of the Vandalia Railroad, in Indiana, for 50 cents a day.
That's how Jill LePore, The New Yorker's critic-at-large, began her account of one of the most celebrated populists in American history, Eugene V. Debs. He ran for president five times between 1900 and 1920.
Contrast Debs' origin story with that of another populist more prominent today.
"It has not been easy for me ... My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars."
That's President Donald Trump's unique take on his humble beginnings. He offered it at a New Hampshire town hall event in October 2015. A New York Times investigation last year declared he was actually getting $200,000 of his father's wealth each year while still a toddler, and has received more than $400 million from his old man's real estate empire. But what's the point of nitpicking?
Before Mr. Trump, no populist - and perhaps no human - ever had followed "not been easy for me" with the statement that daddy had loaned him a measly million. That the Democrats nonetheless lost much of the working class to Mr. Trump shows how far the party has slipped.
But we're going to be hearing of more "populists" as the 2020 presidential campaign warms. The term is defined by Merriam-Webster as "a member of a political party claiming to represent the common people," but can it have any meaning if it includes Mr. Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders and Eugene Debs on the left?
A cursory search of the PG computer files show we had the word "populist'' in stories with the name "Donald Trump" 321 times since January 2014. Some 57 times the word and name were paired in the same paragraph. The word was paired in "Bernie Sanders" stories only 99 times, 32 times in the same paragraph.
Still, considering that there were more than 11 times as many Donald Trump stories as Bernie Sanders stories, the press applied the word more readily to the left. Scanning the coverage, I think I finally know what "populist" means in modern context.
When we in the media use it, we're not so much describing a candidate claiming to represent the common people. Every politician and commentator, no matter how rich or elevated or sneering, claims to represent the common people. Voters get that, and long ago became cynical about that professed commitment.
So when media apply the word "populist" to a politician these days, this is what they really mean: The people showing up for this candidate actually seem to believe him/her. Rightly or wrongly, they see this politician listening to them in ways that others still aren't.
Democrats are still having trouble figuring out why they lost in 2016. They readily criticize Trump supporters for being blind to his faults and sins, but would be better off asking themselves why their campaign pitch was off-key. Mr. Trump took Pennsylvania in 2016 by dominating the counties where the jobs weren't. Carnegie Mellon University's Center for Economic Development found Mr. Trump won big in the eight counties that saw a decline in employment of 10 percent or more between 2007 and 2015. Hillary Clinton took the big urban counties more in tune with the global economy - and they weren't quite populous enough.
Mr. Trump already has won more presidential elections than Mr. Debs did in five tries. The latter's highest vote total came in 1920, when he tallied more than 900,000 votes as the Socialist Party candidate - while in prison for urging resistance to the draft. Yet much of what Debs advocated - women's suffrage, abolition of child labor, maximum-work hours and minimum-wage laws - is now the law of the land.
Those weren't Debs' only legacies. I know this because I'm a baseball geek and, long ago, I became curious about Debs Garms, the Pirate who won the National League batting title in 1940 when he hit .355. I learned Garms was born in Bangs, Texas, in 1907, the eighth of 10 children, and was named after Eugene Debs.
If the Democrats want to reach the voters they once had, they'll need to inspire connections like that. While I know of nobody naming their babies "Trump" in the past few years, there has been a recent bump in children named "Melania," "Ivanka" and "Barron." (Democrats may take solace in knowing "Donald" is down since 2015.)

Play nice now, ya hear? No need to shout

Texto completo: Have you ever learned anything from somebody shouting at you?
Me neither.
The closest I can recall paying attention to a shouter was upon arrival at the U.S. Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, S.C., as three drill instructors took turns placing their noses an inch from mine to bellow for a minute or so. I really did learn quite a lot from them in ensuing weeks, but that was in classrooms, on the parade ground, at the rifle range and other training fields.
Newspaper reporters, editors and columnists get yelled at, too, usually in the form of ALL CAPS emails or fast-talking phone calls that tell us we, and our profession, would be dangerous if we weren't so incompetent. It differs from Parris Island in that we can respond in kind, but playing flak-catcher goes with the job.
We've been hearing a lot about civility lately. Our corporate cousins down at Florida Today are starting a little exercise called "Civility Brevard" this month. The idea is to bring together Trump supporters and never-Trumpers – or just conservatives and liberals in general – to pair off and discuss, calmly, how they differ on issues. If they get through the Melbourne "Red and Blue Mixer" without calling the cops, they plan to host various events and debates through the coming year.
We've got something like that in Tallahassee, too, called The Village Square. It's been going on for more than a dozen years, with speakers and panel discussions exploring all sides of issues big and small. The only rule is to agree or disagree, without being disagreeable.
The Village Square has a panel on "The State of Debate on Campus" scheduled April 16 at FSU's Miller Hall. (Full disclosure: The Tallahassee Democrat is among corporate sponsors of the Dinner at the Square series.)
Encouraging civility during an election campaign is like discouraging beer-drinking at a fraternity party. Or telling professional wrestlers to have an actual athletic contest, rather than a performance out of a Roadrunner cartoon.
Hey, it's worth a try. The climate can't get worse.
But when has American politics been so civil? You could start at the top.
Lincoln was commonly depicted as a baboon, and he even had a war that we call "civil" – sure, now. Were we more civil in the era of Jackson and Jefferson, when politicians used to start newspapers solely to libel each other? Maybe we could bring back dueling, as the late Georgia Sen. Zell Miller suggested – provocatively, but not seriously – when Chris Mathews annoyed him.
Was there an era of good feeling when Vice President Dick Cheney told Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt., "Go f—k yourself" on the Senate floor? Or when a White House microphone caught Joe Biden telling President Obama, "This is a big f—king deal," at the signing of health-care legislation?
George W. Bush described a New York Times reporter with a word our late columnist Gerald Ensley once wrote "rhymes with 'glass bowl'." Harry Truman offered to punch out a Washington critic who was unkind in reviewing his daughter Margaret's singing.
And is our current president less than civil? Oh, just pick anything.
We're not less civil now, we just have more chances to vent our anger over a wider range of media and most of us spend less time in face-to-face discussion, particularly with those we oppose. We've got Facebook and Twitter, and the online cesspool of comment sections on news stories.
News outlets like MSNBC and Fox have found a marketing niche in shameless groveling or needlessly combative political coverage. And it's competitive — if one program calls Trump unfit, the next one has to say he's corrupt and the one after that has to call him insane. Hosts on the other network have to top each other in their flatter.
If we want civility – which a glance at social media says we don't – it could start with ourselves. We could listen to understand, rather than to respond to the other guy. We could be skeptical about everything, even things we like, that appears in Facebook and such. We could tune out talk radio and the evening cable TV commentators who keep an audience by titillating, rather than informing, an audience.
And the best key to a more civil discourse is to imagine the possibility that – on abortion or guns or anything else – the other side might actually have a point.

Darla Arians and Judy Wong: Recycling alive and well in Boulder

Texto completo: Illustration Kristin Olson watches the optical sorter last June at the Boulder County Recycling Center.
A worker sorts through recyclables last year at the Eco-Cycle facility in Boulder.

"Is This the End of Recycling?"
That catchy headline from The Atlantic , as well as a slew of news articles from everyone from the New York Times to Popular Science, has everyone talking about what's going on with recycling. Boulder County residents who have heard about China's National Sword policy, and the resulting disruption of domestic recycling markets, have been asking whether their recyclables are being landfilled instead of recycled. Before delving into details, let us reassure readers — your Boulder County recyclables are definitely being recycled (and they always have been) and are not going to the landfill — so keep recycling .
The Boulder County Recycling Center, owned by Boulder County and operated by Eco-Cycle, has a national reputation for producing consistently clean, high-quality materials, largely because local residents and businesses have long been our partners as savvy and conscientious recyclers. While other recyclers are struggling with the fact that China has closed its doors to most imports of recyclables, the BCRC is actually faring better than most. Our marketing strategy for recyclables has always been focused on producing high-quality materials for local and domestic markets.
That said, over the last year or so, global recycling markets have taken a beating. In early 2017, when China closed its ports to paper and plastic recyclables that had more than 0.5% contamination (an almost impossible specification to meet), the United States lost a huge market that had been buying nearly one-third of our country's recyclables for a decade. China signaled its intent as far back as 2013, but the U.S. recycling industry failed to heed the warning to reduce contamination levels and reinvest in domestic recycling facilities.
The result has been steep price drops for recyclables worldwide, and demoralizing headlines about communities, especially on the coasts, that had no choice but to temporarily landfill paper and some plastics, because their markets vanished overnight. Other communities stopped accepting certain materials, and contrarian pundits claimed that recycling was dead.
Wrong. Recycling isn't dead. It remains an essential element of a sustainable, circular economy, now and into the future. Locally, the BCRC continues to invest in high-quality material production. Over the past two years, Boulder County has invested several millions of dollars in BCRC equipment upgrades, including two new optical sorters for plastics and enhanced cardboard screens. These investments enable the facility to recycle additional types and more tons of plastic items than ever before and to better recover growing volumes and sizes of cardboard. The county also has further plans to invest in the publicly-owned facility as it supports community values around human and environmental health.
In truth, while we are in a short-term market slump, China's National Sword has actually presented the U.S. recycling industry with an opportunity. Now is the time to focus on developing new end-markets within the United States so that the full value of these materials is reinvested in our own economies, and more green jobs are created in our state. For example, glass is a material for which there is a closed-loop recycling system in Colorado. Momentum Recycling in Broomfield cleans and processes glass — from the BCRC and much of the Denver metro region — and then sells this material to the Rocky Mountain Bottling Company for Miller/Coors to use to make new beer bottles locally. In this way, recycling provides manufacturing feedstock and creates jobs locally, in a sustainable circular economy. We need to develop more end markets like this right here in Colorado — an idea that we have been promoting with our new governor and state Legislature.
In sum, recycling is alive and kicking in Boulder County and is still one of the most important actions each of us can do every day to protect our environment, combat climate change, conserve natural resources, and create green jobs. So keep up the good work, recyclers. We'll continue to do our part to help keep recycling thriving in Boulder County if you'll continue to help us follow the guidelines for producing the cleanest, most marketable recyclables possible.

Your lawyer is unreal: How to spot the scammers

Texto completo: Shakespeare once wrote, “First, let’s kill all the lawyers.” And you can insert any of hundreds of lawyer jokes here. (Here’s one: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer? A: His partners.) So why would anybody want to pretend to be a lawyer? It happens, all too frequently, in many guises.
Here are a few to watch out for …
The fake lawyer “suing” you
A common scam these days involves a phone call or an email from someone claiming to be a lawyer representing an opposing party in a lawsuit against you. This fake lawyer may also state they’ve already obtained a judgment against you, and now it’s time to pay up. They may even give you a (fake) case number. Typically they’re demanding personal information and often a settlement amount. Real lawyer (me) wants you to know that’s not how this works.
If there were a lawsuit against you, you would know long before someone started calling to collect money. To start, you would have been served with the complaint. But the easiest way to figure out if the call is from an actual lawyer or even a real lawyer’s office is to ask for the name and bar number of the attorney handling the matter.
If the caller gives you a name and/or number, check with the State Bar of California at calbar.ca.gov/Public to see if the phone number they’re calling from matches the name and bar number you’ve been given. Attorneys (the real ones) in California are required to maintain current contact information with the State Bar.
This faux lawyer wants to represent you
Be wary of scams when you’re searching for a lawyer. Sadly, there are certain areas of law that seem to attract scammers pretending to be lawyers to make a quick buck off your pain. Common areas for this are immigration, disability, troubles with the IRS and personal injury. Signs it’s a scam include demands for large sums of money up front, pressure to retain them immediately, and the insistence that this is an emergency and you’ll soon lose rights if you don’t retain this person immediately.
If you find yourself being approached with offers of representation or even when you’re responding to an ad, be sure to do your due diligence. Again, find out the alleged attorney’s name and check with the State Bar. Check the phone number you’re getting calls from — does it really belong to a law office? Check your gut, too. If you’re feeling pressured, worried, or just queasy, this isn’t the right person to represent you, whether they’re a lawyer or not.
“I’m not a lawyer, I just play one in your documents”
“Document preparation assistance” offices have proliferated in California. You can usually recognize them by their neon signs and big window advertisements stating you can get a divorce, file bankruptcy, do your estate planning … and go home with several Ginsu knives all for $299. (I’m only kidding about the Ginsu knives. Those are extra.)
These offices are staffed with non-attorneys (and, not unheard of, disbarred attorneys) whose role is supposed to be solely to assist you in typing up your paperwork for a divorce, bankruptcy, estate planning or other legal matter. By law, they cannot give you legal advice. What could possibly go wrong?
Well, let me tell you. Here are just a few issues the document preparer cannot advise you on:
* What type of bankruptcy to file
* Is a will sufficient or do you need a trust
* How do your retirement plans or life insurance integrate with your estate plan
* How do federal laws dealing with retirement plans affect your divorce
* How can you tell if the spouse you are divorcing is hiding assets
* Can your soon-to-be ex waive spousal support forever? How about child support?
* Do you need a corporation or a limited liability company? How will that entity be taxed?
And filing incorrect immigration papers can result in permanently destroying a person’s immigration status or losing your place on the years-long INS waiting list.
When you skip the lawyers and head to a “document preparer,” you’re the one who is now “playing lawyer.” You might guess right. You might not. However it turns out, the document preparation assistance guy or gal isn’t responsible — they were just your typist.
Legal matters require legal advice. And yes, we know, it’s not cheap. But it’s cheaper than getting it wrong. If you still go to a non-lawyer, please at least make sure they’re bonded. And remember, they’re not covered by the attorney-client privilege, so anything you discuss with them is not private, and they can be called to testify against you.
The victim lawyer
This is just to make you feel better. Lawyers are becoming the victims of online scams now as well. Usually, it’s someone claiming they need legal assistance and want the lawyer to hold funds for them in the lawyer’s trust account. And guess what they need in order to send that? The lawyer’s banking information. You’re not feeling sorry for us though, are you? It’s OK. We’re used to that.
Q: Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt? A: Because deep down, they’re really good people.

Library 1st in state to install short story kiosk

Texto completo: Mim Eichmann approaches the kiosk in the lobby of the Glen Ellyn Public Library, presses a button and waits for the machine to spit out the surprise.
The anticipation is brief, but delightful: From the slit of the dispenser, Eichmann grabs a scroll of paper, pulling and pulling until she unfurls a strip as wide as a receipt and nearly as long as Mary Poppins’ practically perfect tape measure.
Then Eichmann, with a mysterious voice, begins to read aloud a story she’s never heard before.
"The moment he entered the bar, I knew that Mister J. wasn’t your usual guest," she says.
Eichmann recites the first passage of "The Hidden Letter," a story written by Patrick Ferrer and printed on her strip of paper, a souvenir of her trip to the library.
As intuitive as a vending machine or an ATM, the kiosk has become an object of fascination, a depository for a free literary keepsake that can be tucked away in a pocket or purse and shared with someone else.
Since its arrival about two weeks ago, more than 780 stories or poems have been printed.
The dispensers are relatively new, introduced by French publishing house Short Ã‰dition in 2016. The kiosks have popped up in the unlikeliest of places.
The Washington Post featured a dispenser at a Maryland DMV. The New York Times noted "The Godfather" director Francis Ford Coppola is such a fan he placed one in his San Francisco cafe.
But the Glen Ellyn library is the first in Illinois to house a Short Ã‰dition dispenser. The library also has programmed the machine so every 10th story printed is one written by Eichmann.
"There it is in the flesh," Eichmann said of the kiosk she had only seen in pictures. "How cool!"
The Wheaton folk musician and novelist won a first-place award in a Public Library Association Short Fiction Contest with her story "Slomp," a tale about a 9-year-old boy and his act of courage. Her winning entry is now published through Short Ã‰dition’s dispensers.
Library Director Dawn Bussey first encountered the machine at a convention in San Diego.
She brought back one of the stories she printed, a suspense tale called "A View of the Terrace," to keep on her desk.
"And I share it with almost everyone who comes in my office," Bussey said.
"It’s a suspense story, and its probably three minutes long and you have no idea what the end is until you get to it. It’s amazing."
Typically, the dispensers have a choice of three buttons corresponding to the length of time it takes to read the stories: 1-minute, 3-minute or 5-minute.
But Bussey wanted the device to include a "Spanish" button for Spanish readers and Glen Ellyn students who take foreign language classes in schools.
Readers also can press either a "Children" button or "General Public" (the adult selection) to access Short Ã‰dition’s vast catalog.
"Because it’s connecting to the Short Ã‰dition’s cloud, it’s really unlimited," Bussey said.
"It’s a matter of how many stories they have in their database, and they continue to run contests and judge the stories that come in and then add content to their cloud database."
The element of surprise? You can’t choose the story, the genre, author or era.
"There’s sort of this little surprise feeling like, ‘Oh my goodness. This is a story that I’m getting out of this machine,’" said Library Foundation President Kelley Kalinich.
The library foundation paid for the portable device. The kiosk itself, including the back panel with the library logo and the shipping, costs just more than $10,000.
"The library will pay going forward a subscription to have access to the stories that are in the Short Ã‰dition database, much like we pay subscriptions for the other online databases that we have," Bussey said.
She hopes to take the machine — it only needs an outlet — on the road to schools, the train station, the YMCA and Reserve 22, the restaurant at the Village Links golf course.
She also wants the library to host its own short story contest for children to add winning content to the dispenser’s selection of literature.
"One of the ideas of having it in other locations, of course, is that so many of us take those few minutes we might have in between meetings or while we’re waiting, and we scroll through our phone, especially social media," she said.
"Well, if they can just print out quickly a short story or a poem and spend their couple minutes that way instead, then we’re encouraging reading."

Texto completo: Love for the color pink led to a highly successful children's book series called "Pinkalicious" about a girl who loves pink -using the color in everything from cupcake icing to her choice in clothes.
On April 27, members of the Latrobe Art Center hope an event called "The Art of Fashion: Pretty in Pink" at the Latrobe Country Club will use the popularity of pink to raise plenty of green for myriad art education and community programs that the center sponsors.
One of the inspirations for the event is The New York Times best-selling book series by author and illustrator Victorian Kann. "Pinkalicious," the children's musical, is in its 11th year off-Broadway.
"We wanted to make it fun for adults and children to participate by picking the color pink. Tablecloths, clothes, desserts and even drinks will all incorporate the color,'' organizer Rosanne Bodziak said.
And, although participants don't necessarily have to wear pink, "we think a lot of people will, with their own pink-inspired styles," she said.
Doors open at the country club at 11:30 a.m. A number of local boutiques will have 40 models walking the runway New York-style, showing off clothing and accessories in all hues.
Fashions will be featured from Chicoras in Latrobe; Black Bunny Boutique, My Honey Bee and the Tree House, all in Ligonier; and Crossroads Boutique & Cattiva, Lapels, A Fine Men's Clothier and Liz Krajc Jewelry Design Studio, all in Greensburg.
Lauren Buches, executive director of the Latrobe Art Center at 819 Ligonier St., said it hosts art classes for children and adults, a gallery for local artists, a space for young people to plug in, and a popular cafe called Ricolita's, which is open for breakfast and lunch.
"We have become something of a community center,'' Ms. Buches noted.
The work of artists from throughout the region is featured in the gallery display space and those works are typically for sale.
Betty Roseborough, an artist from Upper St. Clair, has several of her paintings featured and said she appreciates the opportunity.
"It is an excellent venue for displaying your art. The art center is an uplifting, classy place. The staff and other artists create a warm, friendly atmosphere. Everyone is encouraged there," she said.
The retired Pittsburgh Allderdice High School math teacher said she found a new calling in painting. She calls it a "creative monster, but one that is good for the soul."
The artists are limited in the number of pieces they can display, and the artist's work changes every two months so exhibits stay fresh, she said.
"The social events held by the center are a reason to celebrate art," she said.
And the art of fashion will be the one celebrated at the "Pretty in Pink" event.
"We think people will enjoy looking at the fashions, and the food is good, especially the raspberry dessert, " Ms. Bodziak said.
Tickets for the show start at $50 and those who wish to attend must RSVP by April 22. Proceeds support the mission of the Latrobe Art Center.
A chicken piccata lunch, or gluten-free and vegetarian options, and dessert is included in the ticket price. A cash bar will offer pink-themed cocktails.
An interesting twist to traditional fashion shows is the addition to the runway of upcycled and tie-dyed fashions created by the Greater Latrobe Senior High School students from Courtney Coss' family and consumer science classes and Lydia Mack's art classes.
Ms. Buches likes the fact that young people are being included in the program. She said she was inspired by the permanent art gallery at Greater Latrobe Senior High School, where she attended classes, to consider art as a career.

Texto completo: S. Korean court orders easing of decades-old abortion ban
SEOUL, South Korea -- In a major reversal, South Korea's Constitutional Court on Thursday ordered the easing of the country's decades-old ban on most abortions, one of the strictest in the developed world.
Abortions have been largely illegal in South Korea since 1953, though convictions for violating the restrictions are rare. Still, the illegality of abortions forces women to seek out unauthorized and often expensive procedures to end their pregnancies, creating a social stigma that makes them feel like criminals.
The court's nine-justice panel said that the parliament must revise legislation to ease the current regulations by the end of 2020. It said the current abortion law was incompatible with the constitution and would be repealed if parliament fails to come up with new legislation by then.
The ruling is final and cannot be appealed, court officials said, but current regulations will remain in effect until they are replaced or repealed.
Current exceptions to the law only allow abortions when a woman is pregnant through rape or incest, when a pregnancy seriously jeopardizes her health, or when she or her male partner has certain diseases.
A woman in South Korea can be punished with up to one year in prison for having an illegal abortion, and a doctor can get up to two years in prison for performing an unauthorized abortion.
Thursday's verdict was a response to an appeal filed in 2017 by an obstetrician charged with carrying out about 70 unauthorized abortions from 2013-2017 at the request or approval of pregnant women.

4 in Senate GOP signal their opposition to Cain on Fed
WASHINGTON -- A swift defection of at least four Senate Republicans has all-but-doomed the chance of Herman Cain to win a seat on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, serving as one of the most striking rebukes to President Donald Trump's personnel choices since he took office in 2017.
Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., all said they would oppose Cain's appointment to the Fed. Republicans control 53 seats of the 100-chamber Senate, and losing the support of four members means Cain would need help from Democrats, which appears unlikely.
Cain ran for president in the 2012 GOP primary, but lost momentum amid accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct, among other things.
Cain has denied wrongdoing.

Navy drops criminal charges against ex-Fitzgerald officers
Two former officers involved in the June 2017 collision between the USS Fitzgerald and a commercial ship off the coast of Japan will no longer face criminal charges, the Navy has announced.
"This decision is in the best interest of the Navy, the families of the Fitzgerald Sailors, and the procedural rights of the accused officers," the Navy said in a news release late Wednesday. "Both officers were previously dismissed from their jobs and received nonjudicial punishment."
Former commanding officer Cmdr. Bryce Benson was sleeping in his quarters the night of the collision, while former crew member Lt. Natalie Combs was manning the ship's Combat Information Center.
Two other officers were also charged in the collision, which killed seven U.S. sailors.

Trump's sister retires, negating judicial ethics complaints
NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump's sister has retired as a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia, ending a civil misconduct inquiry launched after a report that she participated in Trump family schemes to dodge taxes.
The retirement of Maryanne Trump Barry was revealed in an April 1 order signed by a top court official in New York, where the misconduct case was assigned to prevent conflicts of interest for judges who knew Barry.
A judicial panel began the review in response to four citizen complaints filed in October after The New York Times published a story alleging the president and his siblings evaded inheritance taxes.
Barry, 82, was not identified by name in the order, but the facts matched her circumstances.

Ohio governor signs fetal heartbeat abortion bill
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio's governor has signed a bill imposing one of the nation's toughest abortion restrictions.
Republican Gov. Mike DeWine followed through Thursday on his pledge to sign the heartbeat bill. It cleared the state Legislature on Wednesday.
It makes Ohio the fifth state to ban abortions after the first detectable fetal heartbeat. That can come as early as five or six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they're pregnant.
DeWine's support for the bill breaks with his predecessor. Former Republican Gov. John Kasich twice vetoed it on grounds it was unconstitutional and would spark a costly court challenge.
Even before the bill was signed, the ACLU of Ohio said it was preparing a constitutional challenge on behalf of four Ohio abortion clinics.

Senate confirms ex-lobbyist to lead Interior
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday confirmed acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to lead the department on a permanent basis, despite complaints by Democrats that the former oil and gas lobbyist has used his federal position to benefit former industry clients.
Senators voted 56-41 to approve Bernhardt's nomination to oversee more than 500 million acres of public lands and other resources, including national parks, monuments and wildlife refuges. He succeeds Ryan Zinke, who resigned in January amid a series of ethics investigations.
Bernhardt was confirmed to the No. 2 position in July 2017.
Three Democrats -- Sens. Martin Heinrich, N.M., Joe Manchin, W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona -- voted for Bernhardt.

In space: An Israeli spacecraft crashed into the moon Thursday just moments before touchdown, failing in an ambitious attempt to make history as the first privately funded lunar mission.
The Beresheet robotic spacecraft lost communication with ground control as it was making its final descent. Moments later, the mission was declared a failure.
Opher Doron, general manager of the space division of Israel Aerospace Industries, general manager of the space division of Israel Aerospace Industries said the spacecraft was in pieces scattered at the planned landing site.
He nonetheless called the mission an "amazing success," for reaching the moon and coming so close to landing successfully.

Texto completo: For New Jersey residents, it all feels very new. After years of emotional debate, lawmakers approved a measure last month to allow terminally ill patients to end their lives with medical help, and Gov. Phil Murphy has said he will sign it into law.
But so-called aid-in-dying laws have been in effect for over two decades in the United States. Oregon was the first to approve such a measure in 1994, followed by Washington in 2008 and four other states in the past six years.
Litigation has closely followed just about every successful vote to decriminalize assisted suicide, but courts have generally allowed such laws to be implemented, and polling has shown the policies to be popular among residents with access to them.
As New Jersey prepares to become the latest state to permit strictly regulated, medically assisted suicide for its residents, here's a look at the events that led to the gradual spread of the policy across the country.
Oregon the pioneer In a victory for groups trying to wrest end-of-life choices away from the state and the medical profession, Oregon voters narrowly approved a referendum in 1994 to make it the first place in North America where doctors could legally help patients end their lives.
Oregon's ballot question came in the wake of failed attempts to legalize assisted suicide in Washington and California. But unlike the measures in those states, the Oregon measure did not allow doctors to administer a lethal dose.
Nonetheless, the backlash was fierce. The Vatican, which viewed the measure as a half-step from euthanasia, condemned the Oregon vote as "a day of mourning for all humanity," according to a report in The New York Times.
Such depth of emotion spawned more than a decade of litigation that twice brought Oregon's policy before the U.S. Supreme Court. It would be years before another state followed Oregon's example.
Legal challenges Within weeks of the Oregon referendum, implementation of the law was put on hold after lawyers for the National Right to Life Committee challenged the measure as unconstitutional, arguing that it violated the rights of terminally ill people to equal protection.
Around the same time, other cases challenging bans on medically assisted suicide in New York and Washington made their way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the summer of 1997, justices ruled that the Constitution does not provide a general right to assisted suicide, but they left the door open to states to experiment with such laws.
Four months later, the high court removed the last legal obstacle to the Oregon law taking effect, and voters there again endorsed the measure when they roundly defeated a ballot measure aimed at repealing the law.
After more threats, assisted suicide laws spread A series of threats from Washington, D.C., over the next decade had a chilling effect on other states considering assisted suicide laws. After unsuccessful attempts by members of Congress to overturn Oregon's law, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced in 2001 that doctors who prescribed lethal medication under state law risked losing their federal licenses to prescribe controlled substances.
That directive, too, was met with a legal challenge, culminating five years later in the U.S. Supreme Court again defending the Oregon law, ruling that Ashcroft had overstepped his authority.
Washington was the next state to approve an assisted suicide law in 2008, followed by Vermont in 2013, California in 2015, Colorado in 2016 and Hawaii in 2018. The District of Columbia also allows medically assisted suicide.
Montana does not have a statute permitting the practice, but a 2009 state Supreme Court ruling said state law protects doctors from prosecution for helping terminally ill patients die. Since the ruling, Montana lawmakers have introduced several bills to ban the practice but none has passed.
What to expect in New Jersey If New Jersey is like other states that have legalized medically assisted suicide, participation rates will gradually increase over time. In Oregon, the first state to allow the practice, 249 people received prescriptions for lethal medication last year, up from 24 in 1998, according to state data. Cancer has been the most common underlying illness there, followed by neurological and respiratory diseases.
Deaths under so-called aid-dying laws have accounted for a tiny fraction of overall deaths in other states. Still, it's possible some people from neighboring states could establish residency in New Jersey to take advantage of its assisted suicide law. Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old with terminal brain cancer, for example, made international news when she moved from her home state of California to Oregon in 2014 to legally end her life.
Under the New Jersey measure, patients can prove their residency by showing a doctor their driver's license or non-driver ID card, proof they are registered to vote in New Jersey, a resident income tax return or "any other government record" that demonstrates residency.
If Murphy, a Democrat, signs the measure this month, the new law will take effect Aug. 1.

Furor Outlives Inquiry on Holocaust Artwork Near Rightist Politician's Home

Texto completo: BERLIN -- A criminal investigation into an artist who built a partial replica of Germany's national Holocaust memorial next to the home of a far-right politician has been formally closed, more than 16 months after it began but less than a week after its existence became public.
Reverberations from the inquiry into the artist, Philipp Ruch, and his collective, the Center for Political Beauty, have continued to spread. On Thursday, a letter was released from more than 100 prominent German cultural figures, academics and politicians expressing "disbelief" at the investigation, which employed a legal provision more often used to monitor gangs, extremist groups and terrorist cells.
The letter demands an apology and an explanation from those who undertook the investigation, and calls on them to disclose any political links: Martin Zschächner, an attorney for the state of Thuringia who was in charge of the case, has been accused by the left-wing politician who uncovered the inquiry of being soft on far-right offenders.
The outcry has come after a public discussion about right-wing activists in positions of public authority, and after several publicized cases of extremists among police and army officers.
The weekly newspaper Die Zeit has reported that during the course of the investigation, Mr. Zschächner donated 30 euros, about $34, to Alternative for Germany, the far-right party represented in Thuringia's State Assembly by Björn Höcke, the target of Mr. Ruch's artwork.
On Monday, when the investigation was formally closed, Mr. Zschächner was taken off the portfolio of state security and moved to less sensitive duties.
Mr. Zschächner has not responded to Die Zeit's report,\ and could not be reached for comment on Thursday.
In a phone interview with The New York Times last week, he said the investigation was not political but had been prompted by the collective's own statements about another part of the work: a fake spy room, open to the public, in which Mr. Ruch and his colleagues pretended to monitor Mr. Höcke's home with old electronic equipment.
"On their internet page they said they wanted to spy on him, so the question is whether that happened or was planned," Mr. Zschächner said.
Mr. Höcke, who inspired Mr. Ruch's artwork by denouncing the Holocaust memorial in Berlin as a "monument of shame," is one of only seven Alternative for Germany representatives in Thuringia's 91-seat state legislature. But the party is poised to make significant advances in the state election this coming October.
In an interview, Dieter Lauinger, Thuringia's minister of justice -- a Green Party politician serving as part of a three-party left coalition -- insisted that the investigation itself was inactive and had never made use of the powerful tools legally available to it, such as wiretaps and the employment of informants.
While he was firm that the investigators were just following normal procedure in opening the case, he did say the length of time it had remained open was problematic, especially because other judicial investigations over the artwork were soon dropped.
"From very early on, I've criticized the length of the investigation," he said.
But at least one of the letter's writers considers the matter to be more sinister.
"This is something we otherwise only see in countries like Turkey or Russia -- autocratic countries where art is criminalized, where artists, journalists and scientists who do not conform to the government are branded as terrorists and traitors," said Shermin Langhoff, the artistic director of the Maxim Gorki Theater in Berlin and one of the authors of the letter.
Ms. Langhoff, who organized and helped write the letter, and whose theater exhibited Mr. Ruch's artwork in 2017, argued that the investigation had been launched for entirely political reasons.
The letter's 145 signatories include some of the country's best-known musicians, actors, theater and film directors, academics, television hosts, writers and progressive politicians, from Herbert Grönemeyer, one of the country's most famous singers, to Cem Özdemir, a popular lawmaker and former leader of the Green Party.
"Our concern is really the intimidation of art and we think as artists and culture makers we have to say something," said Ms. Langhoff in an interview. "That's why I took the initiative."

Texto completo: A Y2K-like bug knocked out the city's already-troubled wireless network system.
The bug, known as the "GPS Rollover," hit the city NYCWiN system April 6, affecting several tasks, including remote monitoring of traffic lights at 13,000 intersections, wireless reading of water meters, and a handful of NYPD license plate readers, the New York Times reported.
The city made no public announcements after the outage happened, though Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications spokeswoman Stephanie Raphael confirmed the rollover took down "elements " of the system.
"We're working overtime to update the network and bring all of it back online," she said. "No critical public safety systems are affected by this brief software installation period, and we've taken several steps to make up for the disruption to the few isolated tools affected."
The Global Positioning System keeps track of time in weekly intervals, and every 1,024 weeks, or roughly 20 years, that time-keeping system resets itself.
Raphael didn't say how the city was preparing for the rollover, which the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning about a year ago.
Most of the NYPD's license plate readers don't rely on the network, and the Police Department sent patrol cars with license plate readers to several key spots as part of a "contingency plan," an NYPD spokesman said. The department hasn't seen any disruptions due to the bug, police said.
The city pays roughly $37 million annually to defense contractor Northrop Grumman to maintain the $500 million system, which was installed in 2009.
By 2012, the city already wanted to sell the network back to Northrop Grumman, and in 2015, the de Blasio administration again put the system up for sale because it never lived up to its billing as a broadband network for first-responder agencies.

Former Obama White House Counsel Expects to Be Indicted; Legal heavyweight Greg Craig anticipates charge of making false statements to Justice Department unit checking into activities of foreign agents

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig expects to be indicted in the coming days on charges stemming from work he performed for Ukraine in 2012, Mr. Craig's legal team said.
Mr. Craig has refused to accept a plea deal, and the matter could be presented to a grand jury for indictment as soon as Thursday, people familiar with the matter say. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.
The people familiar with the situation say they believe Mr. Craig will be charged with making false statements to the Justice Department unit that oversees the activities of foreign agents, though other charges are possible.
An indictment of Mr. Craig is likely to send shock waves through the U.S. legal community and is the latest fallout from an investigation into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his years of work for the pro-Russia regime in power in Kiev.
The 74-year-old Mr. Craig is a legal heavyweight who served in senior legal roles for two Democratic presidents. He has also been a top State Department adviser and Capitol Hill aide.
"This case was thoroughly investigated by the SDNY and that office decided not to pursue charges against Mr. Craig. We expect an indictment by the DC US Attorney's Office at the request of the National Security Division. Mr. Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government's stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion," lawyers for Mr. Craig said in a statement.
The matters surrounding Mr. Craig have taken a winding path. It was first developed by special counsel Robert Mueller before being transferred to federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, known as SDNY, and then was transferred again to Washington. The national security division of the Justice Department—which has ramped up its enforcement of foreign lobbying laws—is heavily involved, the people say.
The possible charges stem from the Ukrainian government's hiring of Mr. Craig and his then-law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in 2012 to evaluate the corruption trial of the former Ukrainian prime minister. Mr. Craig spoke to several reporters about the findings of the firm's report, touching off a dispute with the Justice Department about whether that qualified as lobbying for a foreign government in the U.S.
Skadden Arps entered into a $4.6 million civil settlement with the Justice Department in January, acknowledging it misled the Justice Department about its Ukraine work. In the settlement, the firm blamed Mr. Craig for providing the government with the misleading information. Skadden Arps also belatedly registered as a foreign agent as part of the settlement.
Mr. Craig was interviewed twice by Mr. Mueller's office. He left Skadden Arps firm in April 2018.
According to nine letters obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Craig and the Justice Department engaged in a back-and-forth that began in 2012 and continued for more than a year about whether Skadden Arps had an obligation to register as a foreign agent.
The allegedly false statement that government investigators have homed in on involves the timing of Mr. Craig's interactions with reporters, including David Sanger of the New York Times, according to the people familiar with the matter A spokeswoman for the New York Times said the newspaper hadn't received a subpoena in the matter and hadn't provided information to the government.
Mr. Craig didn't bill his client for his interactions with Mr. Sanger, the people say, bolstering his argument that he was speaking to a reporter in his personal capacity.
The people familiar with the matter say Mr. Craig's legal defense will be that he talked with reporters to correct mischaracterizations of the report and protect the reputation of his law firm—rather than to advance the interests of his foreign client. Ukraine used the report to bolster the pro-Russia government's contention that the prosecution of a rival to then President Viktor Yanukovych was appropriate and proper, while the report itself made more narrow findings.
Prosecutors have also suggested to the people familiar with the matter that they believe Mr. Craig concealed the involvement of a public relations firm from Justice Department officials.
To prove a false-statements charge, prosecutors must show that the statements were "material" to an investigation and were knowingly false.
The Justice Department in recent months has stepped up its enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, extracting convictions of senior Republican officials. Mr. Manafort and his associate Richard Gates pleaded guilty to crimes related to their Ukraine work; former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn also admitted as part of a separate guilty plea that he misled the Justice Department about his work for the Turkish government; and another associate who worked with Mr. Craig also pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about the Ukraine work.
Mr. Craig served as the White House counsel to President Obama for the first year of his administration. He also served as a senior legal adviser to President Bill Clinton during the impeachment inquiry into the president's conduct.

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., lambasted Kirstjen Nielsen, saying the outgoing homeland security secretary “oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in recent history.”

"In stealing 1000s of children, deporting their parents,& refusing to provide info for reunification, Sec. Nielsen oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in recent history. Awarding her a lucrative deal or prestigious post is to legitimize+celebrate that abuse," she tweeted on Tuesday.

Ocasio-Cortez's tweet linked to an opinion piece in the New York Times published this week titled, "Cancel Kirstjen Nielsen, her role in terrorizing children should make her a permanent pariah."

"She put babies in cages, traumatized children for life, and then appears to have lied to Congress about what she had done. She did this evil work with either blithe incompetence or malicious sloppiness, failing to create a system to properly track kids who were ripped from their families," the op-ed said.

The policy referenced in Ocasio-Cortez's tweet and in the op-ed is an Obama-era homeland security policy that led to the separation of parents and children of migrant families apprehended at the border. The Trump administration continued the policy, resulting in thousands of family separations and prompted criticism from Democrats and Republicans. Trump’s wife, first lady Melania Trump, was also against the zero-tolerance approach to illegal immigration that led to families being separated at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump reportedly has been considering resuming family separations, placing pressure on members of his administration to use the policy. According to reports, Nielsen opposed the approach, which played a role in Trump’s decision to push her out.

Nielsen's resignation and other high-level purges directed by the White House, reportedly spearheaded by Miller, have battered the department's leadership and underscored tensions between the Senate and the White House. Some GOP senators, who have been vocal about their support for Nielsen, are worried the shakeup will lead to an unstable and highly politicized department.

Days before Nielsen submitted her resignation on Sunday, a group called Restore Public Trust urged Fortune 500 firms to reject any resumes of Trump immigration aides linked to policies that led to the separation of illegal immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, including Nielsen.

Forget Trump; why not make all our tax returns public?

Texto completo: Forget about Donald Trump’s tax returns. I want to know how much my neighbors paid in taxes.
Scratch that. I have wonderful neighbors, most of whom have lived on my street longer than the 27 years my wife and I have been there.
It’s the people a few blocks away I wonder about. How much did they earn last year and what did they pay?
I’m kidding, sort of. But underlying the struggles, the political name-calling and the demands for tax transparency from the nation’s top political leaders is a larger question we ought to consider.
Why isn’t everybody’s tax return public?
This isn’t the first time I’ve asked this. It tends to make for an interesting conversation starter, especially with the federal income tax deadline looming so close.
When it comes to President Trump, his enemies want to know his actual earnings and how low he was able to finagle his actual tax obligation. The demand is grounded in a reasonable assumption that transparency (and perhaps embarrassment) is a great weapon against corruption and privilege.
But if it would work at the highest level of government, why not elsewhere?
For the answer, you can turn to the land of my ancestry — Norway. Ever since the 1800s, individual tax records there have been public.
A schoolteacher in a town south of Oslo told the BBC a couple of years ago that she remembers people lining up in the old days to have a look through the huge books of personal tax information as soon as they were available each year for public inspection. You could learn anyone’s net income, net assets and how much they paid in taxes, but you had to hurry because people were waiting in line behind you.
You can imagine what the digital age did to this ritual. Starting in 2001, the information went online, and Norwegian media put it all on easily navigated websites. Someone developed apps that would automatically rank your Facebook friends by income or that would compare individual earnings by geographic area.
The editor of continentaltelegraph.com said the nation became so obsessed with seeing how much neighbors made that the media began calling this pastime “tax porn.”
Transparency is one thing. But when it leads to something akin to stalking, that’s another. Freedom’s inherent weakness lies in its vulnerabilities. At one extreme, tax cheats are exposed and the wealthy are pressured into paying their fair share. At the other, kids bully wealthy classmates, adults become resentful of their friends and criminals can zero in on wealthy targets.
After several years of this, Norway adjusted its laws. Tax records remain open, but to access them people now must first enter their national ID numbers. Any citizen has free access to see exactly who has been snooping around their data. As a result, the volume of curiosity-seekers has dropped to one-tenth of what it had been, the director of Norway’s tax authority told the BBC.
Given the tenor of discussions I see on social media, often by people using their real names, that might not be such a deterrent in this country.
You do, whether you realize it or not, have access to most public employee salaries. Websites such as openthebooks.com can tell you every one of these from U of U football coach Kyle Whittingham to the humblest of charter school teachers.
But income tax returns are not public, and the salary information generates little, if any, interest.
The question over whether to make all returns public in this country is not new. It raged a century ago, right after the income tax first was made legal.
The New York Times back then argued for total openness, even citing the Bible in its defense.
“All privacy is scandalous,” the paper said. “These are the scriptural days when there is nothing covered which shall not be revealed and nothing hid that shall not be known. … Every man ought to prove that he is or is not taxable.”
Of course, that was back when the idea was that only the richest citizens would have to pay income tax. That idea vanished quickly, and I’m glad the idea of complete transparency did, too.
We can keep pressuring politicians to release their returns, but civility is hard enough to maintain without having regular folks snooping in each other’s assets and deductions, regardless of the good it might do.

Texto completo: Allison Mack, actriz de la serie de televisión “Smallville” sobre Superman, se declaró ayer culpable de crimen organizado en el caso de la secta Nxivm, cuyos dirigentes están acusados de tráfico y esclavitud sexual en las afueras de Albany, capital de Nueva York.
Mack (36) admitió la culpabilidad de dos cargos de crimen organizado y de conspiración, pero aún tienen pendientes otros relacionados con tráfico sexual, usurpación de identidad y blanqueo de dinero.
“He llegado a la conclusión de que debo asumir toda la responsabilidad sobre mi conducta y es por eso que me declaro culpable hoy”, dijo la actriz, citada por el medio Hollywoodlife.
Mack se encontraba en libertad condicional desde el año pasado, así como Clare Bronfman (40), una de las herederas del conglomerado de licores tradicionalmente conocido como Seagram’s.
El supuesto líder del grupo, Keith Raniere (58), es el único de los acusados que se mantiene detenido , tras ser arrestado en México y deportado a Nueva York en marzo de 2018. Enfrenta un mínimo de quince años de prisión y un máximo de cadena perpetua.
Mack también pidió perdón a su familia y a todas aquellas personas que hirió por su “adherencia equivocada a las enseñanzas de Keith Reniere”, líder de la secta, reseñó EFE.
Según la fiscalía, la actriz recibió beneficios financieros a cambio de reclutar esclavas sexuales para Reniere.
El pasado 13 de marzo, la presidenta de Nxivm, Nancy Salzman, también se declaró culpable de conspiración para crimen organizado, robo de identidad y alteración de documentación.
Otras acusadas son su hija Lauren Salzman y Kathy Russel.
Según la acusación, Nxivm formaba parte de un entramado piramidal formado por varias entidades. Entre los crímenes de los que se les acusan están “robo de identidad, extorsión, trabajos forzados, tráfico sexual, lavado de dinero, fraude y obstrucción a la justicia”.
Raniere exigía a su círculo cercano una lealtad absoluta.
Raniere llevaba dos décadas impulsando supuestos programas de autoayuda bajo la empresa paraguas Nxivm, de la que era fundador y que abarcaba centros operativos en Estados Unidos, México, Canadá y varios países de Suramérica.
En el año 2015, Raniere formó una sociedad secreta dentro de Nxivm llamada “DOS”, acrónimo en latín para “Amo de las compañeras obedientes” o “El voto”, donde era el único hombre y el líder, mientras que Mack era “una de las mujeres en el primer nivel de la pirámide, inmediatamente después” de él.
DOS operaba con los rangos de “maestros” y “esclavas”, y se esperaba de estas últimas que reclutaran a otras nuevas.
Todo salió a la luz cuando una “esclava” desertó en 2017 y la historia fue reseñada por The New York Times. Raniere huyó del país poco después de esa publicación.

Why not everyone is happy about Amy Adams’ role in Netflix’s 'Hillbilly Elegy' film

Texto completo: Just a year after Hillbilly Elegy became a runaway success, Imagine Entertainment acquired rights to a film adaptation. The project has been plodding along since then, with Netflix winning a bidding war in January to finance the $45 million film.

In its latest development, the adaptation of J.D. Vance’s bestselling memoir has finally signed its first star: six-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams. The “Sharp Objects” and “Vice” actress may finally win her first Academy Award for the upcoming role, Vanity Fair speculated.

But since it came out in 2016, Hillbilly Elegy has generated mixed reactions. If Adams finally wins an award for her role in the feature, not everyone will be pleased.

Erin Keane, executive editor at Salon and Louisville, Ky., native responded to the news in a piece titled, “Amy Adams probably will win her Oscar for ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ and that's a damn shame.” Keane called the story a “reductive” narrative that would play well with the self-satisfied Hollywood elite but would do no good for the Appalachians whose stories are told:

"As historian Elizabeth Catte, who wrote 'What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia' partly in response to the eagerness with which an educated and affluent liberal audience embraced Vance's story, told me last year, 'They don’t understand, or perhaps they do and they dismiss it, but blaming poverty on poor people is a political opinion. These are people that would be mortified if they had to teach something out of Charles Murray’s bibliography, but they really love 'Hillbilly Elegy' and what it says about the poor.'"

In Vance’s memoir, whose full title is Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis , he describes his upbringing in the Rust Belt, before he joined the military and then graduated from Yale Law School. He expands the stories of his dysfunctional family and the gun-toting hillbillies he grew up with to a broader commentary on the opioid crisis and the white working class.

The book set off a wave of praise and criticism, with many conservatives applauding his explanation of Appalachia’s declining culture and liberals saying he blamed poor people for being poor. Vance’s memoir helped readers on the Left and Right alike make sense of the disillusionment that led many voters to swing for President Trump, but critics said his depiction of the poor, working class in Ohio and Kentucky was less than flattering.

When I read the book, though, I didn’t see it as a blow against Vance’s own culture. He seems to want to raise his own people up with him, to call out specific problems (infidelity, addiction, laziness) that are keeping good Americans down.

Keane is right that the film could become simplistic, and its description might be Oscar-bait. But Vance will be executive producing, and he has shown he’s not giving up on his home.

Two years ago, Vance wrote an op-ed for the New York Times titled, “Why I’m Moving Home.” In it, he argued that to combat the problem of “brain drain,” where educated people leave the cities where they grew up, he was moving from Silicon Valley back to Ohio. He’s now the managing partner of Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, a venture capital fund that invests only in companies outside of Silicon Valley, New York City, and Boston.

Netflix’s "Hillbilly Elegy" adaptation will struggle to rise to the nuance of the book. As with “The Glass Castle,” Hollywood can take the energy of a memoir and fudge it to fit two hours of screen time. But if the upcoming feature can expose more viewers to Vance’s vision of investing back into Middle American communities, Adams can have no better film with which to win her Oscar.

Texto completo: New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell will officially apologize Friday for the largest mass lynching in U.S. history. On March 14, 1891, the city of New Orleans became a charnel house as a mob of as many as 20,000 wantonly slaughtered 11 Italian-Americans. Some of the victims had been charged in the murder of a police chief, but the trials all ended in acquittal or mistrial. A gang descended on the jail where the men were being held, shot them to death, and displayed their bodies for the savage rabble outside. Southern belles in search of souvenirs dipped their lace handkerchiefs in the blood of the butchered Italians.
And the press cheered. The New York Times editorialized on March 16: "These sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins, who have transported to this country the lawless passions, the cut-throat practices, and the oath-bound societies of their native country, are to us a pest without mitigations."
The Washington Post even extolled the killers as "cool-headed men, lawyers, doctors, merchants, and political leaders, all person of influence and social standing."
Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the U.S. Civil Service Commission, wrote to his sister Anna Roosevelt Cowles on March 21: "Monday we dined at the Camerons; various dago diplomats were present, all much wrought up by the lynching of the Italians in New Orleans. Personally I think it rather a good thing, and said so."
In his 1977 book, "Vendetta," Richard Gambino states that between 1870 and 1940 "Italians were second only to blacks in numbers of lynch victims." In her 2004 documentary, "Linciati: Lynchings of Italians in America," filmmaker Heather Hartley cites 50 other slaughters of Italians in eight states—Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, New York and Washington—between 1885 and 1915. "The more I looked, the more I uncovered," Ms. Hartley said.
Mob violence is not the only form of brutal discrimination Italian-Americans have faced. In 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt's infamous Executive Order 9066 branded some 600,000 Americans of Italian descent "enemy aliens." More than 10,000 on the West Coast were forced to relocate, and some 250 were placed in internment camps in Maryland, Montana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Italian-American homes and businesses were confiscated, property was seized, newspapers ceased publishing and draconian curfews were established. Fishermen were not permitted to sail and earn a livelihood. Four Italian-Americans committed suicide.
Despite our republic's debt to the ancient Italian polity of Rome, and the wisdom of Cesare Beccaria and Niccolo Machiavelli, the scions of Italy have long been depicted as an odious "other" in American society. The media owe an apology, too. Hollywood has made billions off anti-Italian bigotry, and the news media has played a major role in sensationalizing vile and repugnant stereotypes.
Americans of every political stripe should hold fast to Filippo Mazzei's dictum, which became our national credo in 1776: "All men are created equal."

Congestion pricing: Overdue wake-up call?

Texto completo: Getting There
Roads have been free so long, people have forgotten how expensive they really are.
We pay enough when it comes to commuting - for our cars, gas, insurance, titles and new tires - the running assumption is the road should just exist for us to drive on. We can be forgiven for assuming as much: The government owns this public space, and has chosen to give it away.
Taking the streets for granted is evident when there's a pothole on the street - why hasn't the city fixed it? When there's a traffic jam on the highway - why hasn't the state widened it? When there's no parking - why isn't there more and why isn't it free?
But with last week's approval of congestion pricing in Manhattan, these long-held, mistaken beliefs and demands may begin to change.
Last week, the New York Times described this shift following the approval of new policy, which will charge a fee on motorists entering Manhattan in an attempt to dissuade them from doing so and, in the process, increasing traffic congestion. The idea is to regulate, and depress, demand through increasing prices.
The article detailed how when government holds the price of something down, shortages occur. If airline tickets were in demand, prices would go up, the article said. Same with avocados. And traffic congestion is essentially a shortage of road, yet the government - that monopolistic provider of pavement - artificially keeps its cost way down.
Congestion pricing, then, is bringing the laissez-faire to the thoroughfare.
"Most radically, if the policy spreads it could challenge a deeply embedded cultural idea, requiring people to pay for something Americans have long demanded - and largely believe they've gotten - free of charge," wrote Emily Badger, who covers cities and urban policy for the Times. "This system looks to us, instead, like an entitlement - driving is an American right, and so the infrastructure that enables it should be free."
In Washington state, where we've gone into debt to build and maintain our roads much like the federal government, the hidden costs of roads comes from the gas tax, bond sales, general fund revenue, tolls, rental car taxes, the vehicle sales tax, ferry fees, and permits and fees on motorists and nonmotorists alike. In Spokane, the city has also tapped into property taxes to help pay for roads.
It's a hodgepodge of funding that everybody chips in to - whether they drive or not. The fact that the government - aka the taxpayers of today and tomorrow - subsidizes driving, while hiding its costs, has been known and hotly debated since the automobile first stormed American cities.
The story goes like this.
In 1909, the First National Conference on City Planning took place in Washington, D.C., and the attendees mostly arrived by horse-drawn carriage. It would be another three years before the New York City's traffic counts showed more automobiles than horses, but the attendees already knew that year that urban transportation issues were quickly changing. Manure in the streets and dead horses causing congestion were yielding to city planners trying to guess what motorized travel would bring.
Mostly, they couldn't. They did, however, realize that roads could help shape how cities looked and advocated for zoning rules to attach land use with transportation, and in a way put on display the costs and benefits of transportation. These early planners also recognized that fast-moving traffic probably wasn't wise in the dense hearts of cities, but that's beside the point of funding.
For awhile, that's how it worked. Early city highway plans called for municipalities to buy land along future freeway right-of-ways to permit certain types of real estate development. After the highway was built, the city-owned property along the road would explode in value and the city would then sell the property to pay off the cost of road construction.
Watching development and value soar along the edges of a new road is anything but hidden. But this way of paying for roads didn't last long.
During the Depression, real estate values and the corresponding property tax plummeted, but car ownership continued to boom, creating a conundrum. The need for new roads was great, but the way they had been paid for to that time had basically collapsed.
Then came the gas tax. Though the first gas tax became law in Oregon in 1919, it wasn't widely adopted by every state until the late 1930s. An easy sell for funding road work, it put the tax burden directly on the road users, was easy to collect and people were driving like crazy when the tax was instituted, making it a greatly increasing source of revenue.
It seemed like a solid solution, until it didn't.
This switch - decoupling roads and property, and moving to a gas tax - had two big repercussions felt to this day.
First, it shifted the power of road-building from the nation's city halls to its statehouses and D.C. No longer would cities carefully plan transportation networks in an effort to accrue road financing. Instead, planning became large and national in scope. Financing had trumped good planning.
Second, it allowed these federal and state governments to "fund roads with gas taxes that feel far removed from a direct user fee," as the New York Times said.
To make things worse, the gas tax has become less and less effective in actually paying for the work its supposed to fund, for a number of reasons, but primarily because of federal lawmakers. The federal gas tax stands at 18.4 cents per gallon. It was last raised in 1993, and it's estimated that only half of the Highway Trust Fund - the main source of federal highway spending - will come from the gas tax by 2020. The fund also runs a $15 billion deficit every year just to maintain current spending.
The picture's a little better in Washington, where the state transportation department funds its work through the nation's second-highest gas tax, which currently stands at 49.4 cents per gallon.
But an increasing share of the state's gas tax goes to paying off a growing pile of debt.
As Roger Millar, the secretary of the Washington State Department of Transportation, said last year, by 2027 more than 70 percent of the gas tax's revenues will go toward paying off bond debt, "so we'll be sending the bulk of the gas tax to the bank."
What's more, Spokane city's road projects are funded through a voter-supported property tax levy, meaning value is siphoned off of every piece of property in the city, goes into a general pot and then is divvied up to pay for the many miles of pavement in the city.
Everyone pays here, motorist or not, either directly as a homeowner, or indirectly as a renter.
If you don't think these funding schemes and mountains of debt hide anything, then I've got a Monroe Street Bridge to sell you.
Spokane probably doesn't have any near futures with congestion pricing, but you never know.
Since 2013, the city's roads have experienced a 10 to 25 percent increase in traffic volumes. As our roads become more and more jammed, the commuters of Spokane could do with a dose of reality, just like motorists in every other city in the U.S.
These roads aren't free, and never were.

Texto completo: The federal government has an oversight problem. This is likely not a news flash to most people, as tales of corruption and scandal seem to be a dime a dozen nowadays.
But the recent revelation that the Drug Enforcement Administration was collecting bulk data about Americans' purchases of money-counting machines, done in secret and without the consent of the courts, is a stark reminder that the lack of oversight is a persistent and serious problem.
Operated from 2008 to 2013, right in the thick of the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance program that was later exposed by Edward Snowden, the DEA's program was issuing "blanket administrative subpoenas to learn who was buying money counters," according to a report by The New York Times.
Money counters are used to process large quantities of cash, something not too many private citizens have a need for. Black market entrepreneurs like drug dealers, however, often make use of such devices. So the DEA's interest in who buys a money counter is somewhat understandable.
But there was no particular focus or case associated with the agency's collection of these transactions, just an unrestrained desire to achieve justice by any means necessary.
The DEA was fully aware of the illicit nature of the program. An inspector general's report found that the agency would often pursue cases against certain individuals without disclosing what evidence had put that person in its sights. Officials had explicit instructions to exclude information related to the money-counter database.
In what may be an early candidate for the biggest understatement of 2019, the inspector general concluded that the DEA had "failed to conduct a comprehensive legal analysis" of this program, and characterized it as legally questionable at best.
This is a remarkably generous assessment of what is almost unquestionably an illegal surveillance program operated by a federal agency. There is likely no telling how many innocent people were caught up in the dragnet.
So what will happen to the people who orchestrated this program and have caused the DEA significant, even if temporary, embarrassment?
In all likelihood, the answer is nothing. With the program six years in the rearview mirror, it is hard to imagine that there is much interest in prosecuting faceless bureaucrats.
But Congress should be motivated to take more care, concern and control over a federal apparatus that often believes it can operate freely and without accountability. Congressional representatives have an obligation to protect their constituents from illegal intrusions by law enforcement and government officials.
There is little solace in uncovering a rampant surveillance program six years after the fact. Representatives who take action against such abuse? Now that's something most people might feel pretty good about.

Stephen Miller, the architect behind Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation

Texto completo: President Trump's top immigration adviser Stephen Miller reportedly played a central role in the series of events that led to the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Sunday.

In a pair of tweets, Trump confirmed Nielsen's resignation after they met at the White House in the early evening. In doing so, Trump announced Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, will become acting DHS secretary.

Although Nielsen wrote in her resignation that she "determined that it is the right time for me to step aside," reports indicate it was Miller who orchestrated her exit.

A senior U.S. official told CBS News that Nielsen's resignation was part of a larger effort by Miller to overhaul DHS. This comes after the New York Times reports Trump and Miller would often complain in private about Nielsen, pinning on her the blame for a surge in migrants arriving to the U.S. and a lack of a solution to secure the border with Mexico.

The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.

The announcement of Nielsen's departure follows top officials at the Department of Homeland Security, including Nielsen, being caught off guard by the White House’s sudden move Thursday night to pull the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This unanticipated maneuver, according to the Washington Post, was due in large part to Miller's rise in influence. Miller, along with ICE union head Chris Crane, had complained about Vitiello. Trump told reporters Friday he wanted somebody "tougher" for the top immigration enforcement role.

Miller, who joined Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign from the staff of then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and remains the one of the last top aides from those days to remain in the White House, has a hard-line view of immigration in line with Trump's tough rhetoric during the campaign and his administration.

A recently released tell-all book about the West Wing said Miller spoke harshly about refugees coming to the U.S. In Team of Vipers , former White House communications aide Cliff Sims quotes Miller as saying, “I would be happy if not a single refugee foot ever again touched American soil.”

Miller also defended Trump's controversial emergency declaration to divert funds for a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border after Congress declined to appropriate the billions of dollars Trump sought for the project.

Despite the hard feelings that reportedly ran rampant behind the scenes, Trump was gracious in announcing Nielsen's departure Sunday.

"Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service," he tweeted.

In her resignation letter, Nielsen wished her successor good luck in border security. “I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America’s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation’s discourse," she said.

Texto completo: For the Democrats it’s still all about the collusion narrative.
They don’t care that the Mueller Report concluded that Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russians did not cooperate to steal the 2016 election.
President Trump’s crazed enemies in Congress and in the liberal media will never believe Trump won fair and square.
You can give the House committees headed by Democrats Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler two more years of digging around in Trump World for impeachable crimes.
You can give them 800 pages, a thousand pages, ten-thousand more pages of interviews.
You can give them another $30 million to waste on lawyers and investigators.
They won’t find anything, but it won’t matter.
The “Russia collusion” narrative of the Trump Hating Industrial Complex will never die.
The Democrats just “know” that the epic tragedy of Hillary Clinton’s defeat could only have happened because Donald Trump cheated.
The president himself was never under investigation for collusion.
Yes, but, but, but, the Democrats say, his son took that meeting with a Russian woman peddling dirt on Hillary.
And his national security advisor for 24 days, Michael Flynn, met with that jolly Russian ambassador.
And his longtime pal Roger Stone supposedly tried to get more hacked Hillary emails from Wikileaks.
It wasn’t against the law for Trump’s son or the others to meet with or talk to those Russians, by the way.
In the deranged minds of Trump haters and the liberal media, however, those and a few other brief encounters with Russians by Trump underlings are solid proof of collusion.
But Muller and his gang of lawyers, including several who were closely connected with the Clinton mob, obviously didn’t agree. No collusion, no obstruction was their verdict.
Meanwhile, while we wait for Attorney General Bill Barr to release the full but redacted Mueller Report, I wonder how long it’ll take the liberal mainstream media to investigate the folks who really colluded with the Russians in 2016 - the Democrats.
Their collusion was instigated by Hillary’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee when they paid the research company Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump.
Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, an ex-British spy, who created a fake, salacious dossier on Donald Trump that Hillary partisans in the highest offices of the FBI used to get FISA surveillance warrants against low-level Trump staffers like George Papadopoulos.
So far, Fox News, talk radio and conservatives in Congress have been the only ones talking about or investigating the partisan origins and FBI’s misuse of the so-called “Steel dossier.”
You’d think the crack investigative journalists at the New York Times or Washington Post would be covering the heck out of this shocking and dangerous abuse of power by the FBI.
You’d think they’d want to expose how far the Democrats and some top political appointees in the FBI were willing to go to prevent someone they didn’t like from becoming president.
But so far the great institutions of the liberal news media are sticking to the “Trump Collusion” script.
They hope to find new stuff in the footnotes of the Mueller Report to fit their Russian collusion narrative, which they refuse to accept has turned out to be the political hoax the president always said it was.
With the economy strong, black and Latino employment at their highest levels and a trade deal with China in the works, the Russian collusion narrative is the only issue the Democrats have.
You know the Muller team tried its best to get anything they could to nail President Trump on collusion. But they came up with zip, ultimately because they were professionals.
Unfortunately, the Democrats in the House running their purely political sideshows are not professionals interested in fairness or the truth.
Schiff and Nadler are partisan, power-hungry hacks who are out to do whatever they can to stymie Trump’s agenda and prevent his reelection chances.
What they are doing in the House every day shows the country what happens when someone really tries to drain the swamp in Washington.

Chelsea Clinton speaks at Kean, signs her new children's book

Texto completo: UNION (Union) – Chelsea Clinton is a household name thanks to her parents. When it comes to children's literature, however, she's making a name for herself on her own.
Clinton, the only child of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State and U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and a best-selling author, presented a sold-out discussion, book signing and audience Q&A at Kean University's Enlow Recital Hall Thursday night, which centered on her fifth children's book "Don't Let Them Disappear."
The book, which was released Tuesday, focuses on the rate at which endangered animals are disappearing around the globe and what the public can do to help solve the problem. Each section introduces young readers to a new endangered animal, including elephants, rhinos and pandas, and shares what makes them special and what we can do to help them survive.
The event, which drew a crowd of 500 adults and children and was moderated by former state Sen. Raymond J. Lesniak, was Clinton's second stop on her "Don't Let Them Disappear" tour, her only Garden State appearance.
Lesniak, who established the Lesniak Institute for American Leadership – an event co-sponsor – as well as Kean's Distinguished Lecture Series, advocates for several causes, including animal welfare.
Lesniak said even he, who worked to make New Jersey the first state in the nation to ban ivory transactions to save elephants from poachers and to ban imports of trophies of endangered species, learned a lot from "Don't Let Them Disappear."
"This is also a book for adults," he said. Clinton, who spoke in accessible language for both children and adults, said that currently she is focusing on young readers because "It's never too early to start highlighting the issues in our communities."
"I think that kids' books are one of the first ways that we tell kids what's possible and what's not, expand their imaginations and show that we value them," Clinton said. "They're little people who are a part of our families and our communities."
Clinton, who also said that she has always loved to write, continued that when she became a parent, she realized that there was a lack of female voices in children's books, which inspired her to write her own.
"So many kids' books are told from a male perspective, so I tried to center my books on women's voices," said Clinton, who also wrote The New York Times-bestselling picture book "She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World." "As a parent, I noticed that it was always a male cat or a male duck speaking."
Clinton said that she also noticed when asking children which issues they cared about, one that always resonated was that of the plight of animals, so it was only natural to choose the theme for her next children's book.
In the discussion, Clinton shared facts about endangered animals, such as there are more tigers in the United States in captivity than there are wild tigers around the world, many of which are in private hunting ranges.
"What kind of person would kill an animal to display it on the wall?" Lesniak said. "Pope Francis said that anyone who is cruel to an animal is also likely to be cruel to human beings. That's why your book is so good. You will teach kids that this is not acceptable."
Clinton also shared facts about the ivory trade and elephants, which she said, "is the first animal that I fell in love with."
"Kids need to say to their parents and grandparents that ivory always looks better on an elephant than it does on your wrist," she said. "Parents are influenced by their kids' decisions and we need to save elephants, which are a keystone specie – meaning that many other animals rely on them."
Clinton continued to say that civilization is a domino effect, meaning that when important species are gone, others will follow – including humans, Lesniak pointed out.
"What's the seventh mass extinction? It's us," he said. "Scientists say that in 50 years, one-third of New Jersey will be underwater if we do not take dramatic action on climate change. We live on this earth together and we don't want to be the seventh mass extinction."
Clinton ended her discussion on a positive note, pointing out that it was kids who helped to save the bald eagle, which was once an endangered species.
"A lot of kids pushed for the preservation of bald eagles when they were on the brink of extinction in the 1970s," she said. "Kids said, 'No, we don't want a bald eagle head in our schools and in our home. We can appreciate them from a picture.'"
Gloria Montalto, a Kean University professor, said she attended the discussion in part because one of her grandchildren is an environmentalist. She said she was impressed at the depth of knowledge about endangered species and the environment that Clinton showed during the discussion.
"My biggest takeaway was that she was very well-informed, and she is wise beyond what her children's book says," Montalto said.
Deborah Linder, another Kean University professor who attended the discussion, said that as an educator, she appreciated Clinton's work for children.
"As a professor, I found her approach intriguing that she tries to work through kids to solve these issues," Linder said. "If you wait until they're older, it's too late and the bad habits are already formed."

Jones' lawyer: Infowars host has a right to speak; Op-Ed

Texto completo: You've probably heard by now that Alex Jones of Infowars plans to defend himself against charges that he defamed the families of folks killed in the mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in 2012 by claiming some form of psychosis.
You heard wrong. You swallowed a meme, becoming the very thing you say you scorn - a dupe to a hateful, half-baked piece of misinformation.
I know this because I represent Alex Jones in three suits pending against him in Connecticut. He faces a related suit defended by separate counsel in Texas.
Alex Jones is not psychotic. He plans to defend himself on the same grounds that protect those who take such joy in ridiculing him: the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.
In a video deposition posted online by plaintiffs' lawyers, he says he was influenced by "something like psychosis" when he opined that Sandy Hook was a hoax. Jones haters seized on this hazy metaphor like starving children diving at crumbs.
The Sandy Hook lawsuits allege that Jones defamed the families by denying the mass shootings took place. For those of us who live in Connecticut, it's hard to take seriously the denial of a reality you lived through. We lost family and friends at Sandy Hook. We saw colleagues grieve.
Let's set the record straight: Alex Jones believes that there was a massacre at Sandy Hook. He entertained the possibility that it was all a hoax when events were fresh. He hosted people who wondered aloud why the FBI would claim there were no homicides in Sandy Hook the very year 26 people were murdered. Just today I received an email from a lost soul claiming it's all a hoax.
Jones never encouraged people to visit the homes of the surviving family members. He did not himself state that the deaths of children were faked by families seeking financial gain or elevated status as spokesmen for gun control. These assertions about Jones have become urban legend - repeated so often they are taken as true. We are eager to test these assertions in open court and to let a fair-minded jury evaluate the actual evidence - if the cases ever actually get to the point of a jury trial.
The cases should be dismissed. Alex Jones hasn't defamed anyone; he has engaged in extreme speech, a form of speech we've cherished since the days of the penny press.
The truth of the matter is Jones has a right to his opinions, no matter how outlandish. That he discomfited the suffering is truly unfortunate. But our newfound instinct to make symbols of survivors in our roiling political debates about such things as gun control transforms them into public figures in the contested terrain of political speech. Declaring these folks to be off-limits is a misuse of pathos. Victims used to mourn in private.
Folks should spend a lot less time taking shots at Alex Jones and more time wondering what makes Jones possible. It's the same sort of question Trump haters ought to ask. Millions of voters and listeners flock to these men not because they are crazy but because they offer alternatives to mainstream narratives that fail to resonate with folks who have little to gain from tuning into CNN, MSNBC or reading the pages of The New York Times.
Before I chose to represent Alex Jones, I ignored him. His views were too extreme for me. He wasn't a figure I hated; he just didn't matter. He was the town crier warning the end is neigh.
Now I defend him from you - you, who want him silenced - because you scare me more than he does.
There is no mob quite so terrifying as a self-righteous mob. Suppressing speech because it offends a majority of folks gives the power to censor speech. We're close to banning speech simply because it is hateful. Even Mark Zuckerberg now wants new legislation to limit speech. We've gone from wanting information to be free to fearing the heterodox.
What motivates hate is fear. Alex Jones and his listeners are afraid of what this country is becoming. You are afraid of Alex Jones and his outlandish conspiracy theories. You're more alike than you think.
Fight your differences out in the marketplace of ideas. But let's not fall down the bottomless pit of censorship. Alex Jones is not psychotic, and neither, I suspect, are you, although some days I'm not so sure about either of you.

Barr Orders Investigations Of Discrimination at F.B.I.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Attorney General William P. Barr has directed parts of the Justice Department to investigate accusations of discrimination, including claims that the F.B.I. academy weeded out potential agents for not being "masculine enough" and that it has become harder for transgender people to work at the Bureau of Prisons.
Mr. Barr's request came in response to a letter that he received last week from DOJ Pride, a Justice Department group founded in 1994 to advocate the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. Less than half of the group's members said they believed that the Justice Department does not discriminate against them, the letter said, adding that the finding and others from a survey undertaken in October show that members have become more alienated from the department under the Trump administration.
"Given the crucial role the department fulfills in our society -- enforcing the nation's laws and administering justice -- we are concerned that so many employees who dedicate themselves to the department do not think the department values them," members of DOJ Pride wrote.
In response, Mr. Barr vowed that the Justice Department would not discriminate against workers based on sex, sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as a long list of other "non-merit-based" factors.
"Employment decisions at the department must be made solely on merit and free from discrimination," he wrote in a letter on Thursday addressed to the group and distributed to the more than 115,000 employees of the Justice Department. "Every employee should know that I stand by the principle."
The exchange shows how Mr. Barr is working to raise morale after many Justice Department employees described a drop over the past two years, particularly among gay, lesbian and transgender employees.
The F.B.I. said in a statement that it needs people "from all different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives" to effectively do its job protecting Americans and that it does not tolerate discriminatory behavior. The Bureau of Prisons did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Barr, who was sworn in as attorney general in February, is settling in to a Justice Department that underwent a drastic shift under his predecessor, Jeff Sessions, who moved away from the civil rights-centered agenda of the Obama era to one that reflected his ultraconservative stance on immigration, civil rights and social issues.
As Mr. Sessions refocused the department's civil rights work onto protections for people of faith, police officers and local government officials, critics warned that those moves effectively curbed the rights of gay, lesbian and transgender people, as well as of minorities who faced discrimination from the police.
Mr. Sessions also pushed back on departmental efforts to extend civil rights protections to transgender people. He ordered prisons to house transgender women with men, a move that many human rights experts said put the transgender women at risk of assault, and defended President Trump's ban on transgender soldiers in the military. In October, the department sided with a funeral home that had fired a transgender woman, arguing that the definition of sex in the Civil Rights Act was biological and "does not apply to discrimination against an individual based on his or her gender identity."
And while the heads of all federal agencies are required by law to issue an Equal Employment Opportunity statement saying that they are committed to providing equal employment under the law and a workplace free of discrimination, Mr. Sessions never did.
Mr. Sessions's policy positions reverberated inside the department as well. The survey of DOJ Pride members from October, a month before Mr. Trump forced out Mr. Sessions, found that less than a third of respondents believed that the department "values its L.G.B.T.Q. employees," and only 43 percent believed that it "does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression."
The survey also found that gay, lesbian and transgender employees believed that the department had recently become less welcoming to employees who were not heterosexual. One respondent said that the treatment was grounds for quitting.
Some members of DOJ Pride were upset when Guy Benson, a Fox News contributor, was chosen to speak at last year's annual gay pride celebration. Some members attended a separate awards ceremony, where one person said that the group would not return to the shadows, according to video of the proceedings obtained by The New York Times.
In a letter to Mr. Barr last week, the leaders of the group noted that Mr. Sessions had never issued the Equal Employment Opportunity affirmation and said that they believed that it was especially important for Mr. Barr to do so in light of the department's recent decisions not to extend civil rights protections to transgender people.
Mr. Barr issued that statement on Thursday.
The attorney general has yet to lay out an agenda on gay rights. During his confirmation hearing, he said that he would support a law that would ban antigay discrimination, but he noted that he does not believe that current sex discrimination laws apply to gay, lesbian and transgender people.
But in his letter this week, Mr. Barr wrote that the department would act swiftly when employees are found to have discriminated.

WASHINGTON -- A previously undisclosed invoice indicates that David Bernhardt, President Trump's choice to lead the Interior Department, continued to lobby for a major client several months after he filed official papers saying that he had ended his lobbying activities.
The bill for Mr. Bernhardt's services, dated March 2017 and labeled "Federal Lobbying," shows, along with other newly disclosed documents, Mr. Bernhardt working closely with the Westlands Water District as late as April 2017, the month Mr. Trump nominated him to his current job, deputy interior secretary. In November 2016, Mr. Bernhardt had filed legal notice with the federal government formally ending his status as a lobbyist.
Westlands, a powerful California agribusiness group, was one of Mr. Bernhardt's main lobbying and legal clients between 2011 and 2016. During that time, Westlands paid Mr. Bernhardt's firm $1.3 million for lobbying services.
A New York Times investigation this year revealed how Mr. Bernhardt made it a priority at the Interior Department to promote policies long sought by Westlands, including a weakening of Endangered Species Act protections for a rare fish. Those changes would have led to the release of vast amounts of water from the delicate ecosystem of the San Francisco Bay Delta for irrigation of commercial farmland.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Bernhardt, Faith Vander Voort, said in an email that the invoice had been labeled incorrectly and that the documents did not describe lobbying activity.
"David Bernhardt did not engage in regulated lobbying activities for Westlands Water District from the date he de-registered forward," she wrote. "Mr. Bernhardt engaged in various legal services that supported the senior employees and Directors of the Board of Westlands Water District, who are public officials, operating in their official capacity. These efforts do not constitute regulated lobbying activity."
Lara Day, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bernhardt's former firm, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, which is based in Denver, did not respond to voice mail messages or emails requesting comment. Westlands Water District did not respond to a request for comment.
The Senate Energy Committee voted 14-6 on Thursday to send Mr. Bernhardt's nomination as interior secretary to the full Senate for a confirmation vote.
In committee hearings, Democrats criticized Mr. Bernhardt as beholden to industry while Republicans praised his depth of knowledge. Two Democrats, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, and one independent, Senator Angus King of Maine, voted with Republicans in favor of Mr. Bernhardt's confirmation.
Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who leads the committee, said of Mr. Bernhardt Thursday morning: "There are accusations about his ethics. I think it's very clear you've got some well-funded groups that are working hard against him."
She added: "I am aware of no substantiation of them whatsoever. I would be stunned if they would be substantiated. We have known about this previous work he had at Westlands."
The documents, including the March 2017 "Federal Lobbying" invoice sent to Westlands by Mr. Bernhardt's former firm, were obtained under California open-records law by the office of the California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, and by the environmental advocacy group Pacific Advocates. They were reviewed by The New York Times.
The invoice itemizes the costs of services described as "Westlands Trip," taken by Mr. Bernhardt in late January and early February 2017 from Washington through Denver, Sacramento and Chicago before heading back to Washington.
It includes a charge of $2,432.68 for Mr. Bernhardt's travel, as well as a $25,000 charge "for professional services rendered" in February 2017. During the previous year, a period when Mr. Bernhardt was an official registered lobbyist, Westlands paid his firm a $25,000 monthly fee.
Lara Day, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bernhardt's former firm, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, reiterated that the description of Mr. Bernhardt's work in February 2017 as "Federal Lobbying" was an error. "I can confirm that David was not doing federal lobbying," she said.
Mr. Bernhardt's spokeswoman, Ms. Vander Voort, also said the work performed by Mr. Bernhardt in 2017 did not constitute "regulated lobbying."
Several experts who reviewed the documents offered a different interpretation. They pointed out that the documents appear to show Mr. Bernhardt meeting with, and communicating with, federal officials to advocate for policy matters on behalf of a paying client, which is the basic work of lobbying.
The action described by the documents "raises ethical questions," said Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group. "He obviously was engaged in some sort of federal lobbying activity on behalf of Westlands even after he de-registered as a lobbyist."
Mr. Bernhardt's activities, if they constituted lobbying, could violate federal laws requiring lobbyists to disclose their activities, according to four independent authorities on the rules.
The documents include several emails with Johnny Amaral and Thomas Birmingham, the two officials at Westlands who worked closely on federal lobbying matters with Mr. Bernhardt during the time he was a registered lobbyist.
They include an email dated December 2016 from John Watts, an aide to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who works on the state's water-policy issues, to Mr. Bernhardt and Mr. Birmingham. The subject line is "Memo: Endangered Species Act consistency of California water language." It addresses two issues, endangered species and water rights, on which Mr. Bernhard had lobbied for Westlands.
On Jan. 2, 2017, Mr. Bernhardt emailed Mr. Amaral and Mr. Birmingham with "a short draft letter" addressed to Representative David Valadao, Republican of California, "expressing appreciation" for the lawmaker's successful efforts to include legislative language related to a water infrastructure bill on which Mr. Bernhardt had already officially lobbied, and thanking the representative for his work on another bill related to water policy in the Central Valley. The final letter sent by Westlands to Mr. Valadao contained several passages identical to those drafted by Mr. Bernhardt.
On Dec. 8, 2016, the water infrastructure bill passed the House and Mr. Bernhardt emailed Mr. Amaral expressing optimism that the bill would easily win in the Senate as well.
Mr. Amaral responded: "You're winning all kinds of bets aren't you? We should be going to Vegas!!!" Mr. Bernhardt replied, "There is no way it will fail in the Senate."
Over the course of the first half of 2017, Mr. Amaral sent several emails to Mr. Bernhardt and a small group of Westlands officials referring to the group's weekly "team" telephone calls.
Another email, dated April 19, 2017, from Mr. Amaral, asked Mr. Bernhardt if he could make it to a "team breakfast" the following Wednesday, April 25. Bernhardt responded, "Yes." Three days later, Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Bernhardt to be deputy secretary of the Interior Department.
Mr. Amaral now works for another California water district, the Friant Water Authority. He did not respond to voice mail or text messages sent to his cellphone.
Ethics experts said the documents shed light on the close relationship Mr. Bernhardt maintained with his former lobbying client.
"The fact that he is attending a 'team breakfast' with Westlands just days before he's nominated is a shocking level of connection with this lobbying client at a moment he is about to enter government," said Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group. "It goes to this deep, intertwined relationship that he had."
Since his appointment to the Interior Department, Mr. Bernhardt has been criticized for using his position to enact some of the policies he pushed for as a lobbyist for Westlands Water District, a state-chartered agribusiness organization representing about 700 almond, cotton and tomato farms in the San Joaquin Valley.
As part of his May 2017 Senate confirmation hearing, Mr. Bernhardt submitted a written statement to senators saying, "I have not engaged in regulated lobbying on behalf of Westlands Water District after November 18th, 2016."

New York's Segregated School System is an Embarrassment

Texto completo: Every time another school shoot ing occurs in America, it's common to hear a chorus of "thoughts and prayers," a symbolic term used by politicians who pretend to care about the tragedy, but do not have the courage or conviction to call for the type of change-namely, gun control-that would actually make shootings less likely to happen in the future.
The same dynamic is true of the admissions results to New York City's eight specialized high schools (SHS). This year's figures just came out and are as bad as ever.
Of the 895 students admitted to Stuy vesant High School, just seven are black. That's seven out of the 5,288 black students that took the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), the highest scores of which get you into Stuyvesant, followed by Bronx High School of Science, then Brooklyn Tech, then the five newer schools opened since 2011.
In a public school system that is 70 percent black and Latino, about ten percent of total SHS offers go to black and Latino students. This is an embarrassment, and an indictment of our system of "public" education.
The single test admission mechanism for the eight SHS was set by a state law adopted in 1971, over much controversy, as part of a broader effort to prevent "white flight" from the city, and to preserve some top "public" schools for white families. Forty-eight years later, our school system is highly segregated, with black and brown students for the most part concentrated in under-resourced schools and admission to the city's elite and top performing high schools all but reserved for those who score high on a standardized test.
Education experts use the term "opportunity hoarding" to describe how families with resources are able to create public institutions to serve their own purposes. That's exactly what's happening with the city's elite high schools. And while these schools only serve a small fraction of the more than one million students in the system, the appalling underrepresentation of students of color in their ranks is symptomatic of the pervasive inequities inherent in the system.
For consecutive years now, the number of black and Latino students admitted into the SHS has dwindled. While decrying the results, most politicians have refused to call for the elimination of the single test admission policy. Instead we're told the remedy is more test prep, expanding "Gifted and Talented" programs, or encouraging more black and brown students to apply to SHS.
Last week, however, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said what few elected leaders in New York have had the courage to say regarding the controversial singletest admission policy governing the city's elite high school: Time to abolish it.
I applaud the Speaker for having the courage to take this stand. Last June, Mayor de Blasio announced a plan (based on a CSS proposal) to improve diversity at the eight SHS, which would allow the top seven percent of students from every middle school-as long as they are in the top25 percent city wide-direct admission to the SHS, using grades and state exams that everyone takes and prepares for.
This would quadruple the numbers of black and Latino students, while barely changing proficiency on standardized state exams (which, unlike SHSAT, everyone takes and are actually connected to what you are supposed to learn in middle school).
But while the mayor proposed a good plan, we have not seen him take the political action necessary to get it passed in Albany. Now that the Speaker has called for an end to the single-test policy, perhaps the mayor and more of our elected leaders will summon the political courage to seek real change on an issue that requires action, not symbolism.
The only way we are going to change admission results at SHS is by eliminating the single test criterion. Period. For years, the single test has been pitting public school parents against each other while giving an unfair advantage to students and families with resources to pour thousands of dollars and hours into test preparation.
Those who say more test prep is the solution to the abysmal representation of black and Latino students in these schools are ignoring data and research that show it is not having an impact. And here's a statistic for all those politicians who defend the single-test policy out of fear of alienating the Asian community. Seventy percent of Asian students who apply to the SHS do not get in via the single-test. In other words, there are many subgroups and nationalities within that larger SHS applicant pool that end up on the outside looking in due to the single test policy.
We now have two of the most important elected officials in our city openly acknowledging that it s time to eliminate the SHSAT. And in another important editorial, the New York Times called on the Mayor to de-designate the five newest specialized high schools that are not named in state law, and to apply his percentage plan to their admissions immediately. I could not agree more. The momentum for change is building, and we aren't backing down.

At the theater, furious rebuttals in the age of #MeToo

Texto completo: In a recent interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN, author Rebecca Traister pointed to a large, gaping hole in the history books: Namely, that they have habitually minimized the intensity and the effectiveness of women's anger as a force for social change.
“We've never been taught the story or given the view of women's anger as politically potent," said Traister, whose book “Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger" was published last fall. “Women's anger, even when it has existed, has often been covered over by the people telling the story of it."
At this moment, though, that story is being forcefully told on stages from Boston to Broadway. The anger of women, and their determination to fight back against the role of systemic misogyny in making them feel undervalued and unsafe in the world, has formed the basis of recent and current productions as different as Lyric Stage Company of Boston's “The Little Foxes," Sleeping Weazel's “The Audacity: Women Speak," Flat Earth Theatre's “Not Medea," Also Known As Theatre's “Extremities," and the riveting “What the Constitution Means to Me," at New York's Helen Hayes Theater.
Even generally lighthearted classics like Lerner & Loewe's “My Fair Lady," George Bernard Shaw's “Pygmalion" (from which “My Fair Lady" was adapted), and Cole Porter's “Kiss Me, Kate" now resonate differently, having been tweaked by contemporary directors to emphasize the defiance of their incensed female protagonists and the legitimacy of their grievances.
Doubtless this emphasis on women's anger is driven in significant part by the heightened awareness of male misdeeds engendered by the #MeToo movement. But reflecting the experiences and feelings of half the population of the planet — and perhaps to some degree offering a cathartic outlet — is the kind of day-to-day work that theater should routinely do and is uniquely well-suited to do.
Because immediate audience feedback is such a central component of the art form, the impact can be instantly measured. I can attest that at recent performances of stage works channeling, expressing, and foregrounding women's anger, the fervent reaction of female patrons could be summed up as: Me Too. To cite just one instance, when Kelli O'Hara tore through the number “I Hate Men" in the Roundabout Theatre Company revival of “Kiss Me, Kate," the response by female spectators inside Studio 54 signaled clearly that the song was registering not as a tantrum but as an expression of generalized disgust at the male gender.
In “What the Constitution Means to Me," playwright-performer Heidi Schreck emphasizes that “I love men," adding with a laugh:“I'm the daughter of a father!" Then she stops laughing and notes : “But the facts are extreme." Indeed. Schreck lays out those facts in unblinking and powerfully compelling fashion (New York Times critic Jesse Green wrote that Schreck's play “is angrier and more pointed now" than during its earlier run off-Broadway). She uses the nation's founding document as a lens through which to examine centuries of unchecked violence against women, including a few harrowing chapters of her own family history, and asks a question that cuts to the heart of the lofty promises contained in the Constitution: “What does it mean that the document will not protect us from the violence of men?"
Some members of the audience were brought to the verge of tears at the performance I attended when Schreck recounted stunning statistics about, for instance, the number of American women who have been killed by “violent male partners." She confessed that she has to get that out of her mind just to “get through the day," but then added, in haunting words that countless women would doubtless agree with: “Except, I think, the knowledge of it is always there. Even if you don't know the statistics, I think you can feel the truth of it underneath everything . . . humming."
Of course, this is not an era when women need to look very far beneath the surface to find fresh reasons for concern and fury. In the fall of 2016, Donald Trump won the White House — defeating Hillary Clinton, the first major-party female nominee in US history — even though he was heard boasting on the “Access Hollywood" tape about grabbing women's genitals and has been accused by numerous women of sexual misconduct (which he has denied). In the fall of 2017, the #MeToo movement took off on Twitter, triggering a near-daily flood of revelations about sexual misconduct by powerful men that continues to this day. Last fall, psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers, which did not prevent Kavanaugh from being confirmed to a lifetime seat on the nation's highest court, where he could rule for decades on issues affecting the lives of women.
Perhaps nowhere among recent local productions is the rage many women feel toward President Trump more scaldingly captured than in Sleeping Weazel's “The Audacity: Women Speak," a drama about sexual violence and harassment conceived and arranged by Charlotte Meehan, with contributions from more than 30 other women. One woman in “The Audacity" recounts being raped by a classmate when she was younger, then says bitterly: “I relive this every time 45 opens his filthy mouth. Words turn to sewage coming out from that hate-filled, smug face."
A combination of women's anger and determined action has defined several other productions in the Boston area and on Broadway. In Lillian Hellman's “The Little Foxes" (1939), Regina Giddens (indelibly portrayed by Anne Gottlieb at Lyric Stage), who is seething at being denied her rightful share of the family inheritance because she is a woman, finds a way to ruthlessly outmaneuver her two brothers and gain the fortune that had eluded her. In William Mastrosimone's “Extremities" (1982), a young woman named Marjorie (played by Alissa Cordeiro in the current Also Known as Theatre production) turns the tables on a would-be rapist and then proceeds to take drastic action while pondering the question of what, exactly, constitutes justice for her attacker.
In Flat Earth's recent production of Allison Gregory's “Not Medea" (2016), a haze of ambiguity surrounds a family tragedy involving a pediatric oncology nurse (Juliet Bowler, delivering a brave and intensely committed performance), but there is no mistaking her desire for vengeance on the narcissistic husband who has humiliated her by having an affair with a younger woman. In both the current Broadway revival of “My Fair Lady" and in the February “Pygmalion" at Cambridge's Central Square Theater by the New York theater company Bedlam, Eliza Doolittle has more agency, and Henry Higgins pays a steeper price for his arrogant mistreatment of her, than is often the case in productions of those works.
Perhaps one measure of the pervasiveness and perniciousness of male prerogatives can be found in the fact that even Cher has to fight for autonomy. In “The Cher Show," a bio-musical that is now at the Neil Simon Theatre on Broadway, a young Cher complains to Sonny Bono, her husband and costar in a TV variety show, that “It's always a bunch of guys telling me what to do." Sonny airily replies: “What are you gonna do? It's a man's world."
Cher pushes back hard against that notion (and you could say she spent the rest of her life refuting it). It's a constant battle, but there is plenty of evidence onstage today that it is a battle that women are ready to wage for as long it takes.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump's nominee to lead the Interior Department moved closer to confirmation Thursday with overwhelming committee approval that included support from several Democrats.
The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted 14-6 in favor of advancing David Bernhardt, Interior's current acting secretary, to a full Senate vote. Six Democrats voted against Mr. Bernhardt, but three—including the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia—voted in his favor.
It is up to Senate leadership to schedule a final vote. That process often takes weeks or months, buy many Republican leaders have been eager to get Mr. Bernhardt confirmed.
Mr. Bernhardt, 49 years old, is a former lobbyist and industry lawyer who represented oil producers and pipeline companies among many other corporate clients in front of Interior. As Interior secretary he oversees vast swaths of the country, along with oil and mineral production from those lands, and also the endangered-species program, wilderness areas and parks.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Mr. Bernhardt continued to lobby for a client months after filing papers saying he was no longer doing so, but Mr. Bernhardt said it was legal work, not lobbying.
The Republican committee chair, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, dismissed the report, saying that the Interior's internal watchdog said it has no open investigations into Mr. Bernhardt.
She and Mr. Manchin said Mr. Bernhardt's long record at the department —having also led its legal team under President George W. Bush—and his work as a private-sector lawyer makes him highly qualified.
"He's clearly qualified, I think we all know that," Mr. Manchin said. "And he has the knowledge and experience to serve as secretary. He knows the Interior Department inside and out. That might be a blessing and to some might be a concern."

Texto completo: As growing numbers of migrants -- especially families and mothers with children -- are seeking to enter the U.S. along our country's border with Mexico, the system for processing and detaining them is under increasing strain.
Last week, President Donald Trump, who has long called for harsh measures to deter immigration to the U.S., threatened to close the U.S. border with Mexico.
The State Department has cut off some humanitarian aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Residents of the three Central American countries account for most of the migrants who continue to make their way to the United States as part of the so-called "migrant caravans."
Both moves disregard who is trying to come to American and why. As a result, these "solutions" are counterproductive.
There are two basic elements to this type of migration -- the pull of opportunities and safety in the United States, and the push of deteriorating conditions in the country migrants are leaving.
Addressing both the pull and push is essential.
While the number of people seeking to enter the United States at southern border stations is increasing rapidly, it remains below historic highs. A major problem is that U.S. processing facilities are not set up to handle the large numbers of children arriving at the border, either with a parent or alone. Most U.S. border facilities are set up to process single men, who have made up the bulk of would-be immigrants for years.
Children and families are being held at make-shift facilities -- including in a tent compound under a bridge in Texas that was emptied over the weekend. Because there are too many people to process, many are moved to holding facilities around the country, some far from the border.
Critics say that the Trump administration was long ago warned that a surge was coming -- migration to the southwestern U.S. is seasonal with fewer making the journey in the heat of summer -- and failed to plan for it.
"The current surge was totally predictable and the Trump administration chose not to prepare for it. Instead it launched a raft of harsh deterrence measures that were totally ineffective," Wayne Cornelius, a migration scholar at the University of California, San Diego, told The New York Times.
The overflow is compounded by a Trump administration policy change that requires that each migrant be processed, with a hearing, before being allowed to enter the U.S. or turned back to their home country. This has resulted in the detention of more than 40,000 migrants on a daily basis. Under an Obama administration policy often called "catch and release," migrants who were deemed not to be a safety threat and were likely to appear in court for a hearing, were allowed to enter the U.S. as immigration officials focused on immigrants who were a higher priority.
The Trump administration thought a "get tough" approach would deter migration from south of the border. It has not.
Like most migrants, those from Central America are often leaving their home country to seek a better life and to escape violence. A parent motivated to walk 2,000 miles with their child is pretty driven to leave misery behind and to take a chance on safety and opportunity in America.
The best way to change this dynamic is to improve conditions in their home country through the aid that the Trump administration is beginning to withhold.
A key goal of foreign aid is to improve economic conditions in the countries that receive that aid, says Kristin Vekasi, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Maine. In Honduras, for example, American investment aims to create more economic opportunity for Hondurans so fewer of them will want to leave the country. If the U.S. stops its aid, these countries will have less money to make needed improvements that could improve their economies and decrease violence -- and they will resent the U.S. if conditions deteriorate.
"It defies logic to think that [taking away foreign aid] would decrease the number of migrants" from these countries, Vekasi told the BDN in December, when the president threatened to pull aid from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
There are serious problems at the southern U.S. border, caused by an influx of migrant families and children, and a lack of U.S. planning. Solving these problems will require policies that are proven effective -- such as hiring more judges to hear immigration cases, monitoring some immigrants rather than holding them in detention camps and continuing humanitarian investments in Central American countries.

Biden defends past behavior but says he'll change

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a two-minute video released Wednesday, defended past behavior of close contact with women that has come under recent scrutiny, but also said he's able to change.
The response from Biden, who is laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run, came a day after two more women shared stories of encounters with him that they alleged were inappropriate. Their comments followed similar complaints from two other women.
"I want to talk about gestures of support that I've made to women and some men that have made them uncomfortable," Biden said, seated on a couch and speaking directly to the camera. "I've always tried to make a human connection that's my responsibility, I think ... it's the way I've always been, it's the way I try to show I care about them and listening."
Biden continued, saying he is going to be "mindful" of people's boundaries going forward.
"The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. I get it, I get it, I hear what they're saying and I understand it," he said. "I'll be much more mindful, that's my responsibility, and I'll meet it."
Biden stopped short of apologizing for his past behavior, instead circling back to his previous defense that politics is about human connection.
Questions about Biden's behavior with women have flared since last Friday when Lucy Flores, a politician in Nevada, shared her first-person account of an alleged incident with Biden at a campaign event when she claims he kissed the back of her head.
Since then, Amy Lappos alleged Biden rubbed noses with her at a fundraiser, and on Tuesday The New York Times published stories of two more women who allege Biden touched them in ways that they say were not appropriate.
Biden's propensity for being affectionate, once brushed off as "Biden being Biden" is now being viewed through a #MeToo lens, and it could prove problematic for his expected presidential run.
But Biden's defenders point to his work sponsoring the Violence Against Women Act and combating sexual assault on campus as examples of how he's led on these issues throughout his career.

Insufficient training for pilots suspected in deadly Ethiopian crash

Texto completo: (TriceEdneyWire.com/ GIN) - Fifty three minutes. That was the length of time approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) for pilot training on the upgraded Boeing 737 Max 8 jet that crashed Sunday in Ethiopia killing all aboard, according to a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association.
Nor was the 53 minutes for face to face training. It was "computer assisted" over a laptop with slides and imagery. Some of the pilots felt shortchanged.
Reports in The New York Times suggest that Boeing was able to convince the FAA that the 737 pilots would not have to undergo costly retraining because the upgraded plane was enough like the older model.
This worried the pilots group. The tragedy of Lion Air, the Ethiopia predecessor, was a focus of intense debate in aviation circles because of the determination by Boeing and the FAA that pilots did not need to be informed about a change introduced to the 737's flight control system for the MAX.
Two U.S. pilots' unions said the potential risks of a safety feature on Boeing Co.'s 737 Max aircraft that had been linked to a deadly crash in Indonesia weren't sufficiently spelled out in their manuals or training.
The Lion Air crash took the lives of 189 people. The cause of the disaster is still under investigation.
Meanwhile, relatives, co-workers and friends of the Ethiopian Air victims remain stunned at the untimely loss of over 149 passengers and eight crew members. Flight 302, known as the "U.N. shuttle" to some, was carrying at least 32 Kenyans, 8 Canadians, nine each from Ethiopian and France, eight each from the U.S., China and Italy, seven from Britain.
Among the private citizens lost in the crash was Pius Adesanmi, professor and news columnist, "a rare being, ebullient, with a razor-sharp mind," wrote Nigerian author O.C. Osundu. "He was what the Yoruba call an Omoluabi yet when it came to polemics he could easily morph into a jaguda... good night my brother...we both came a long way. Nigeria has lost one of those who loved her most."
The airline identified the pilot as Yared Getachew and the first officer as Ahmednur Mohammed. Mr. Getachew had more than 8,000 flight hours, He was a "confident captain" according to his family.
The flight was carrying a high number of UN workers because it was the day before a session of the UN Environment Assembly.
Professor Adesanmi, before Sunday's Flight, posted an eerily prescient photo of himself holding his Canadian passport, along with the text of Psalm 139.9-10.
"If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea," it read, "even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me.

Hats, knives helped sailors escape capsized ship

Texto completo: No one knows exactly how the sailors aboard the F.D. Hodgkins were dressed.
The six-man crew of the merchant schooner did not wear uniforms and they were probably attired in a hodgepodge of shirts, trousers, coats and shoes that enabled them to move about freely as they worked the rigging and sails of the three-masted sailing vessel.
Most of the crew accessorized their meager wardrobe with hats, which in the late 19th century was de rigueur for men working outdoors. The sailors also had sharp knives stuck into their belts to cut, splice and repair the lines that composed the schooner's web of rigging.
Hats and knives may have been mundane parts of a sailor's attire, but when the F.D. Hodgkins reached the Delaware coast, these simple items were lifesavers.
In 1884, the F.D. Hodgkins, commanded by Captain R.C. Bonsey, was completing the last leg of its maiden voyage from Jacmel, Haiti, with a cargo of logwood when it arrived off Fenwick Island.
The weather was calm as the sturdy Maine-built schooner sailed northward along the Delaware coast; but as happens often in March, a strong squall with high winds and heavy seas blew over the sailing vessel.
The sudden wind caught the schooner's sails and tipped the vessel over capsizing it, and throwing the captain and crew into the water.
Fortunately, all six men were uninjured by their sudden plunge into the ocean, and they were able to make their way to the overturned hull of the F.D. Hodgkins, where they clung until the squall had passed.
After the wind calmed, the sailors found the ship's small boat lying bottom up and still attached to the lines of the davits. Armed with the knives that they carried, the sailors cut the boat loose from the davits' rigging.
Next, they turned the boat right side up, but it was still nearly filled with water. Using their hats as makeshift buckets, the sailors bailed most of the water out of the boat.
According to the New York Times, "They then sprang into the boat, but the latter was without oars, and it was with difficulty that they prevented it from striking against the wreck and becoming swamped. They tore up some of the planking in the inside of their boat to use for oars."
The men in the small boat probably could not see the Delaware coast, and they decided that the best strategy for their survival was to keep close to the wrecked hull of the schooner which had a bigger chance of being spotted by a passing ship.
Although the squall had passed, the seas remained heavy, and waves sometimes splashed into the small boat. Equipped with their hat-buckets, the sailors were frequently forced to bail the water out.
After spending a cold and wet five hours in their small boat, the sailors spotted another schooner and immediately began to row with their improvised oars toward it.
The schooner was the Joshua S. Brazdon, which had also sailed from Haiti, bound from Port au Prince for New England. The Brazdon rescued the exhausted sailors and landed them in Boston.
Meanwhile, three tugboats were dispatched from Philadelphia to Delaware coast, where they were able to turn the F.D. Hodgkins right side up.
According to the Delaware County Daily Times of Chester, Pennsylvania. "Three tugboats, the Ivanhoe, Protector and Baltimore were seen coming up the (Delaware) river yesterday with a graceful looking schooner in tow. Her topmasts were gone, her sails hanging in shreds, and a general look of desolation about the vessel."
The schooner was salvaged, the sailors were saved, and all because of their wardrobe accessories — hats and knives.

Texto completo: Fox News host and avid Trump supporter Sean Hannity reportedly advised former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen watch out for former girlfriends ahead of the 2016 election.

Cohen ultimately paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 and former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 over their alleged affairs with President Trump.

According to two unnamed sources who were cited in the New York Times' investigation into the relationship between the Murdoch family and the Trump campaign, the Fox News host “had effectively been a member of [Trump’s] campaign team, for instance pressing Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to be on the lookout for former girlfriends and employees who might make trouble for the candidate ahead of the election.”

In December, Cohen pleaded guilty to using campaign funds to pay off Daniels and McDougal. Trump's former personal lawyer had indicated in his plea agreement that the payments were made at Trump's direction.

Cohen was sentenced to prison last month for lying to U.S. officials and for financial crimes committed in relation to his work for Trump in the private sector.

Texto completo: Elon Musk has come under recent scrutiny from the SEC for some ill-advised tweets, from shareholders about closing stores, and even paparazzis for his relationship to indie musician Grimes.
Those blows were probably softened by his $2.28 billion compensation last fiscal year from Tesla. That means his compensation is 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker’s, which is about $56,200, according to Bloomberg.
Tesla has about 48,800 employees, the news outlet reported. The majority of Musk’s total compensation, which would be paid out over 10 years, is in stock options contingent on Tesla hitting several targets for revenue, market value and more, Bloomberg said.
So far, the company has met two of the 16 goals, according to that news organization. Tesla is required to pay Musk at least minimum wage, about $37,000 a year, but he told the New York Times he doesn’t cash the checks and therefore does not receive an annual salary.
Tesla had the largest CEO-to-median worker compensation ratio among public companies in the data analyzed by Bloomberg. However, Musk’s realized compensation last year was $56,380, which would make the CEO to median worker ratio 1-to-1, according to documents Tesla filed with the SEC.
In addition to salaries and stock options, CEO compensation can include bonuses and even additional costs incurred by companies on their bosses’ behalves.
For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a salary of just $1 but a total compensation of $8.85 million in fiscal year 2017. That includes $7.3 million for Zuckerberg’s personal security at his Palo Alto home, as well as when he’s traveling, plus $1.5 million for his use of a private airplane, according to a 2018 proxy statement.
Facebook employees had a median compensation of $240,430, so Zuckerberg had a 37-to-1 ratio. That’s far smaller than the median CEO to employee ratio of 137-to-1, according to Bloomberg. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, had total compensation of about $25.2 million in fiscal year 2017, mostly in stock awards, according to the proxy statement.
Twitter’s median employee compensation was lower, $161,860, but their CEO, Jack Dorsey, didn’t take a salary. Dorsey was paid $2.75 by Square, the payment processing company he also runs. Square employees have a median compensation of about $152,300.
Likewise, Alphabet — the company formerly known as Google — paid its CEO Larry Page $1 in fiscal year 2017, the most recent data available from Bloomberg. The median Alphabet employee earned almost $197,300.
Salesforce’s billionaire CEO Marc Benioff had $4.65 million in compensation, and his median employee earned about $155,300 — a 30-to-1 ratio. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation was $15.68 million, a 238-to-1 ratio to the tech giant’s median employee, who earned about $55,400.

Texto completo: E.L. James' latest novel is supposed to be many shades different than the controversial and so popular "Fifty Shades of Grey" that launched her publishing career. "The Mister" is described as a "roller-coaster ride of danger and desire" that takes place in London, Cornwall and the Balkans. James will discuss her novel with Books & Books owner Mitchell Kaplan at 8 p.m. May 1 at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts Knight Concert Hall, 1300 Biscayne Blvd., Miami. Tickets cost $35-$55. VIP seating is $55, which includes a meet-and-greet with James as well as priority performance seating and a signed copy of "The Mister." For details, visit BooksAndBooks.com.
'One Amazing Thing'
This year's One Book Boca community-reading selection is "One Amazing Thing" by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, who will discuss her novel at 4 p.m. April 13 at the Boca Raton Public Library, 400 NW Second Ave., Boca Raton, 561-393-7852, BocaLibrary.org.
In "One Amazing Thing," nine people trapped together by an earthquake share "one amazing thing" from their lives - personal tales they've never told anyone. A follow-up discussion will be held 7 p.m. April 18.
In addition, discussion guides for book groups will be available at the downtown Boca library; the Spanish River Library, 1501 NW Spanish River Blvd.; and online.
Bookstore on the move
Readers get a double bonus as Murder on the Beach Mystery Bookstore settles into its new site in the Delray Beach Public Library building, 104 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach. The bookstore and the library will have separate entrances, but the goal of serving readers will be the same.
A bookstore in a library is rare, but not a new concept. With this move, store founder and manager Joanne Sinchuk said she hopes they will complement each other. "We're hoping for a synergy between the two," she said.
While the new space is slightly smaller than the current store, the parking lot is much bigger and should accommodate buyers and library patrons. Murder on the Beach's phone number and hours of operation will remain the same. Contact 561-279-7790, MurderOnTheBeach.com or email murdermb@gate.net for more information.
Murder on the Beach is a locally owned independent bookstore specializing in mystery, suspense and thrillers. It was founded in 1996 by Sinchuk and located in Sunny Isles Beach before moving to Delray Beach in 2002.
Florida's WWII history
New York Times best-selling author Michael J. Tougias will discuss the details behind his nonfiction book "So Close to Home," which chronicles how dozens of U-boats lurked off the Florida coast during WWII, at 2 p.m. April 13 at the Coral Springs Museum of Art, 2855A Coral Springs Drive, 954-340-5000.
Tougias has written more than 25 books about maritime, travel and adventure topics. His 2009 book "The Finest Hours: The True Story Behind the US Coast Guard's Most Daring Rescue" was adapted as a Disney film by the same name in 2016. Visit MichaelTougias.com for more information.

Texto completo: DALLAS -- Moments before the home team was introduced on Monday night, Kristaps Porzingis made his usual walk behind the scorer's table to take a seat on the Dallas Mavericks' bench at American Airlines Center.
Wearing a three-piece olive suit and a maroon tie, Porzingis saluted a friendly face in the crowd and proceeded to what has become his customary vantage point. It was Porzingis's 13th home game as a spectator since Dallas acquired him from the Knicks on Feb. 1, as he continues to recover from a serious knee injury he sustained in February 2018.
Porzingis, in other words, projected normalcy in his first public appearance since it emerged that he is under investigation by law enforcement authorities in New York City over an accusation that he sexually assaulted a woman there.
As the Mavericks reveled in an unforeseen 16 points and 14 rebounds from the reserve center Salah Mejri, Porzingis was right in the heart of multiple bench celebrations. Coach Rick Carlisle had given Porzingis the option of taking personal time away from the team to escape the glare of the spotlight, but Porzingis declined. He wants to keep practicing, Carlisle said, and uphold his rooting routine through the final five games of the Mavericks' third successive season of missing the playoffs.
These, of course, are not normal times for the Mavericks -- not when Porzingis, whom they acquired just 60 days ago to serve as a cornerstone for the franchise alongside the electric Slovene rookie Luka Doncic, is facing such grave allegations.
Porzingis's lawyer, Roland G. Riopelle, "unequivocally" denied the accusation and revealed that he formally referred the accuser to the F.B.I. in December for what he termed her "extortionate demands."
The New York Police Department and the Manhattan district attorney's office have confirmed an investigation is underway, but representatives have declined to comment further. The woman filed a complaint on Thursday that accused Porzingis of sexually assaulting her in his Manhattan apartment on Feb. 7, 2018 -- mere hours after he sustained the debilitating knee injury.
The woman did not respond to several phone calls requesting comment.
For the Mavericks -- one season removed from a sexual harassment scandal that led to multiple firings and an overhaul of the franchise's business and human resources departments -- the case has invited fresh scrutiny of a trade for a marquee player who is the subject of a serious criminal complaint.
Complicating matters for the Mavericks is their assertion that they cannot comment on the investigation. Before Monday's unexpected victory over the short-handed Philadelphia 76ers, the Mavericks' owner, Mark Cuban, reiterated to a group of reporters that the team was told by federal authorities not to comment about the case. The F.B.I. declined to comment.
"I've got nothing to say -- n-o-t-h-i-n-g," Cuban said, spelling out the word and repeating a stance he has maintained since the allegations against Porzingis were first revealed Saturday night. "When I said federal authorities said for us not to comment, they were being serious."
Cuban and other Mavericks officials have referred all Porzingis-related questions to the N.B.A. The league office, however, has not responded to requests for further elaboration from The New York Times beyond its brief initial statement, from the N.B.A. spokesman Mike Bass, that "we are aware of the situation."
Riopelle said he had provided the district attorney's office with materials that show the woman attempted to extort Porzingis.
"We are confident that after the district attorney reviews these materials, they will recognize that the complaint in this case is completely meritless," Riopelle said.
Porzingis's camp has received public backing from Michele Roberts, executive director of the National Basketball Players Association and a former trial lawyer.
"We have been aware of these allegations for some time, have evaluated the accuser's claims and, based on what is presently before us, stand with Kristaps," Roberts said in a statement.
The New York Times reported on Saturday that before the trade, the Knicks made the Mavericks aware of a potential "extortion issue" with Porzingis. One person briefed on the trade call between the teams and who was not authorized to discuss it publicly expressed the belief on Monday that the N.B.A. would not have allowed the trade to go through if the case against Porzingis appeared to be strong.
It appears that the N.B.A. is letting that investigation play out or awaiting further developments before deciding on any action against Porzingis -- although the league, under the terms of its joint policy with the players' association on matters of sexual assault, can place players on administrative leave in these situations if it sees fit.
Dallas had aggressively pursued the trade for Porzingis, a 7-foot-3 forward from Latvia, with an open determination to sign him to a new five-year maximum contract worth an estimated $158 million in July. Cuban declined to answer on Monday night when a reporter asked if the Mavericks remained eager to sign Porzingis to such a lucrative contract.
Not much with the Mavericks is clear at the moment, although Carlisle insisted to the news media before the Philadelphia game that "basketballwise, it's business as usual," no matter what is swirling around Porzingis. Dallas then went out and took advantage of the sidelined Joel Embiid (knee) and Jimmy Butler (back) to follow up Sunday afternoon's win at Oklahoma City -- despite Doncic's injury absence -- with a 122-102 rout of the 76ers.
"Did we look distracted?" Carlisle said.

Texto completo: We in the news media often whack politicians for not being serious about policy. And then we ignore their policy proposals.
So here, in the spirit of orgiastic wonkishness, is my Dummy's Guide to Democratic Policy Proposals. I write it because something fascinating is underway: After decades of incrementalism, Democrats are now proposing a litany of exciting big ideas.
Here's my take:
 Child allowances are among the best ideas to boost America's future. They are used very successfully abroad to reduce child poverty. One proposal would give families with children $250 to $300 per month, in the form of a refundable tax credit. Luke Shaefer, of the University of Michigan, estimates that this would reduce the number of children living in poverty by more than one-third.
This version is called the American Family Act, sponsored by Michael Bennet and Sherrod Brown in the Senate and Rosa DeLauro and Susan DelBene in the House. It is broadly backed by Democrats in the House and the Senate.
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, in an important new report, calculate that child poverty costs the United States some $1.1 trillion each year. So if you think child allowances are expensive, just look at the cost of child neglect.
 Baby bonds have been proposed by Sen. Cory Booker and are an excellent way to reduce wealth gaps and help low-income families buy homes, afford college and start businesses. The idea is that every child would get a $1,000 savings account at birth, and then children in low-income households would get an additional $2,000 deposit in the account each year.
At age 18, the person would get control over the account - which at this point could be worth almost $50,000, including interest - but it could be used only for wealth-building purposes, such as education, a down payment on a home or possibly starting a business.
Such accounts have been rigorously studied since the 1990s and have been remarkably successful at helping people gain financial success, often as entrepreneurs. As Robert E. Friedman wrote in his excellent recent book on such accounts, "A Few Thousand Dollars," the accounts increase homeownership, education and business startups (they work best when paired with financial literacy training and savings matches). A plus: Baby bonds would reduce most of the racial wealth gap in the U.S.
 Child care for at-risk kids is one of the highest-return investments we can make. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has proposed a high-quality child care program that resembles the U.S. military's outstanding program, paid for on a sliding scale depending on the parents' income.
The focus of Warren's program is helping parents find child care while they work, and that's important. The United States was a world leader in helping women get into the labor force, but we have lagged the last couple of decades. For prime-age women, we now rank 30th out of 35 advanced countries in female labor force participation - partly because of child care challenges.
But while the economic gains are potentially enormous, the even more important reason is to put at-risk low-income children on a path to success. Research suggests that investments in early childhood, especially for kids in dysfunctional homes, are perhaps the best investments this country could make.
How do we pay for all this? I like Sen. Bernie Sanders' suggestion for raising the inheritance tax plus various wonky steps that target the wealthy, like eliminating the step-up basis and ending the gap between capital gains and earned income rates.
Warren's proposed wealth tax is also intriguing. It has been tried in Europe and failed, but it may be more workable in a larger country like the United States that people are less likely to cut ties with.
It's true that the wealth tax would be a challenge for paper billionaires with illiquid private companies. But we already have a wealth tax - the property tax - that hurts low-income widows. If impoverished widows can manage, so can billionaires. I suggest testing at a 1 percent rate for billionaires.
There are some bad Democratic ideas out there, too. Rent control typically backfires by reducing supply and compounding shortages. Legislation that would make companies pay a tax equivalent to the food stamps and school lunch subsidies employees receive would lead companies to avoid hiring people in low-income households, particularly those with children.
There are also many more good ideas, including vigorous antitrust enforcement to break up semi-monopolies, an expanded earned-income tax credit and other job initiatives, plus universal health insurance (though multi-payer has worked well in countries like Germany, so no need to be dogmatic about single-payer).
These policy proposals don't have the drama of a denunciation by President Donald Trump of his rivals, but they could help reshape America. So let's treat them as no less important than Trump's tweets.

Texto completo: Rev. D. Craig Landis
"Love is love." That's what Reverend D. Craig Landis was probably thinking when he passed away in his sleep at St. Luke's Quakertown Hospital on the morning of March 30, 2019, while comforted by family and friends. To those who knew him best, Craig valued nothing more than the power of love among people to live well and make the world a better place. Born into a family of brick makers and merchants in a small town last century, Craig grew up the oldest and only son of Daniel and Charlotte Landis of Boyertown, PA. Craig was a quick learner with an offbeat sense of humor. Like his mother, he had a habit of counting nearly everything under the sun. She taught him how to write and keep a proper financial ledger; he gave her the idea that baseballs hit foul at Phillies games should be tallied. When his father passed away, Craig was only 13. He relied on the Boy Scouts of America for guidance during his teenage years. He became very active and reached the rank of Eagle Scout; he later became an assistant scoutmaster. After graduation from Boyertown Area Senior High School, Craig made his way to Muhlenberg College where he discovered his true calling, which was to devote his life to God. He enrolled at Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, interned at St. Andrew's Lutheran Church, South Perkasie, and was ordained a Lutheran pastor in 1964. While at Muhlenberg, Craig met his future wife, Anne Goldwater of Briarcliff Manor, New York, on a blind date and they were married in 1962. As Craig and Anne made the rounds of Southeastern Pennsylvania, they began to create a family, first with daughters Beth and Heather and later with sons Marc and Drew. In the early years, Anne and Craig moved from congregation to congregation; St. John's Lutheran Church, Hamburg, PA, from 1964 to1967; St. John's Lutheran Church, Richlandtown, PA, for the next 19 years; and finally, Trinity Lutheran, Perkasie, PA, where Craig finished a total of over 50 years in ministry. During his years serving others, Craig devoted countless hours to youth and ecumenical work within the community, often pairing activities and missions with other local parishes. He was active in the Richlandtown Lions Club for more than half a century, and he served many terms as president. Craig also was a lifetime member of the Upper Bucks YMCA and was on the Board of Directors of Silver Springs - Martin Luther School. A tireless advocate for the disenfranchised and struggling, Craig was faced with a personal family tragedy of his own when his son, Marc, committed suicide in 1983. In 1984, Craig and Anne co-founded and co-facilitated the Survivors of Suicide (S.O.S.) group and remained involved with this organization and the Compassionate Friends Quakertown Chapter for over thirty years. Craig was a man of great curiosity and many interests. With interests as diverse as astrophysics and philosophy, he spent years developing his own theory of cosmogony to explain the creation of the Universe. He was as much an advocate of rigorous daily exercise as daily red wine and chocolate. A devoted fan of both the Eagles and the Phillies, he attended countless games (but, of course, he could count them) and solved numerous New York Times crossword puzzles. He played solitaire like a pro. And as big as his heart was, so was his sweet tooth. He had an unabashed affection for dark Swiss chocolate, Reese Peanut Butter Cups and Coca-Cola. He spent the last few months of his life in residence at Phoebe Ministries Richland, where he continued to minister to roommates and residents. Craig always had a moment to talk, a moment to listen, the wisdom to counsel, and the time to reflect. He was a teller of jokes, which brought smiles to all of us who knew him. Craig loved to say that he had used up at least 15 of his nine lives. Despite his many setbacks, he would always find a way to soldier on by focusing on his next goal, then picking another. Craig lived four days past his 80th birthday. In his final hours of his life, he said that his next goal was to live until 2022, when he and Anne would celebrate 60 years of marriage. Craig is survived by his beloved wife, Anne, of Quakertown, PA; daughters Beth Landis and Heather (Landis) Pierson Raffaele (Al Raffaele), of Quakertown, PA; Drew Landis (Paul Raine), of West Hollywood, CA; sisters Dona (Landis) Brown (Fred Brown), of Irving, Texas; Pris (Landis) Duman (John Duman), of Niles, Michigan; four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
Craig will be honored and remembered on Saturday, April 6, 2019, at Trinity Lutheran Church, 19 South 5th Street, Perkasie, PA, 18944. Calling hours will be from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., with a service and luncheon immediately following.
In lieu of flowers, the family requests that you make memorial contributions to Silver Springs Martin Luther School in Plymouth Meeting or to the Trinity Lutheran Church, Perkasie Endowment Fund, which he created. www.nauglefcs.com

Texto completo: When, on May 17, 2017, the Justice Department named former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to oversee the investigation into the Trump campaign and possible collusion with the Russians, The New York Times virtually hailed it as a triumph of democracy. Mueller was described in the most glowing of terms with words like "unblemished," "credible," "exacting," and as a man "who is credited with building the modern FBI."
For more than 675 days, we have been subjected to a steady drip of leaks, endless Russia collusion coverage and the suggestion that Trump was the Manchurian — ur, I mean, the Russian — candidate who was sent to assassinate American democracy as we know it. Whenever there was no news on the Mueller front, we could always expect Stormy Daniels to be given extensive coverage. Mueller's investigation into Trump's alleged wrongdoing would be the long-awaited answer to Hillary Clinton's book, "What Happened."
Only it wasn't.
Or, more precisely, it was; it just wasn't the answer Democrats wanted — or should I say, it wasn't the answer Democrats needed? On the same day that Mueller was appointed special counsel, Trump issued this: "As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know — there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity."
Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report indicates this is precisely what happened, which is highly problematic for Democrats. Having put their proverbial eggs in the Russia collusion basket, the Mueller report is an anticlimactic ending to an epic buildup.
And this is where it gets uncomfortable for Democrats. Because they have continually endorsed Mueller as the font of integrity ruthlessly searching for the truth, it now becomes more than a little awkward to condemn the results of his investigation. What do they do now?
For the moment, Democrats appear to have a two-pronged strategy:
First, launch yet another Trump investigation. "The Mueller report is one document," declared Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia. "It is not, however, the final word on ongoing investigations, criminal or otherwise." Reps. Maxine Waters of California and Eliot Engel of New York remain equally defiant.
Second, they are attacking Attorney General Barr for not releasing the full report. This enables them to continue doing what they have done throughout the Mueller investigation: Hint that the Trump campaign did indeed do something sinister, but it just hasn't been revealed to the public.
Both strategies are inherently risky.
In the first instance, Democrats run the risk of giving Trump victim status by appearing to be on a witch hunt. If Mueller found nothing on this president after more than $25 million, two years of investigation and 34 indictments, the public may deem that enough.
In the second instance, the strategy can work only so long as the attorney general does not release the report or, if he does, it is found to contain the hoped-for smoking gun. If, however, Barr releases the report and his summary proves to be accurate enough, this strategy fails, too.
With the nuclear option off the table for now at least, Democrats are suddenly on the defensive.
They might have unwittingly ensured Trump's re-election.

Texto completo: Gene Keady says it's a part of college basketball that's made players soft, given them an "easy route."
Kansas coach Bill Self says it's the way to play ball these days as long as there are four guys who have the ability to stretch out.
Bob Knight always despised it, saying it took away basic fundamental offense and, even late into his Texas Tech coaching days, refused to let it dominate his team's game.
It's the 20-foot, 9-inch-plus shot, better known as a 3-pointer, which was adopted 33 years ago Tuesday by the NCAA and forever changed the college game.
As often is the case with any major rule change in sports, the 3-pointer didn't take off immediately, but slowly and steadily was infused into the game, growing more prominent as each season passed.
Just 15.7 percent of baskets attempted by college teams were 3s during the first season of the 3-point line. Today, players are shooting more than 38 percent of their shots from behind the arc.
Over the weekend, Elite Eight teams in the NCAA Tournament attempted 192 3-point shots in their four games, shooting 33 percent.
Purdue blew away the other seven teams, going 14 for 32 (43.9 percent) from the 3-point line in its overtime loss to Virginia. Carsen Edwards hit 10 of those 3-pointers.
"If you've got a really good shooter, it changes the entire game," said Keady, who coached Purdue from 1980 to 2005. "A 20-point halftime lead means nothing."
For Virginia coach Tony Bennett, the danger of the opponent's 3-pointer can wreak havoc on the game plan.
"He made me rip my play card in half when he hit the shot off the glass," Bennett said of the 3-pointer Edwards shot with just over a minute left in regulation, giving Purdue a 69-67 lead. "I just ripped it in half."
'No lead is safe' It was April 2, 1986 when the NCAA made the 3-point shot official, using a distance of 19 feet, 9 inches, which was changed to 20 feet, 9 inches in 2007. But some college teams and conferences had been experimenting with it long before that.
The first known game with a 3-point shot happened in 1945, when a matchup between Columbia and Fordham included a 21-foot line good for three. "In an effort to make basketball a more interesting and wide-open game, the Columbia-Fordham contest tonight at the Morningside Heights gym will be played under new rules," the "New York Times" wrote in an article previewing the monumental shift.
Once on the court, the players seemed to like the rule. Though, according to "Columbia Magazine," players became confused at times.
"Officials called several players for traveling violations when they forgot to dribble and simply ran out to the three-point line while carrying the ball," the magazine wrote.
In the end, Columbia won 73–58, with 11 three-pointers, while Fordham made nine. After the game, fans were given a survey on the 3-point shot. The results: 148 in favor and 105 against.
There were other single game tests of the 3-point rule through the years. In 1961, Boston University and Dartmouth played a game that counted all field goals as three points.
Keady remembers games -- before the NCAA implemented the 3-pointer -- where coaches would come together to decide beforehand if they wanted to include the long shot.
When Rick Pitino was coaching Boston University in the early 1980s, Keady and he agreed to give it a try. Purdue had Curt Clawson.
"He could shoot and he nailed several 3s," Keady said. "And we won."
All these years later, Keady has mixed feelings on the 3-pointer.
"It depends. It makes payers softer, lets them take the easy route," he said. "That's old school. People don't want to hear that. It makes it more entertaining for the fans, but no lead is safe."
Growth of the deep shot In 2018, Division I college teams shot more than 250,000 3-point shots, according to the NCAA, the most since 1986. Of late, 3-pointers have become a prominent part of the game.
Since 2000, the total 3-pointers taken by college teams has increased 66.7 percent, the NCAA says. And no team has made more than Belmont. The Bruins have drained 5,449 3-pointers since 2000, an average of 9.5 made per game. That adds up to 37.2 percent of all Belmont's points.
For comparison, the average Division I team hits 6.5 3-pointers per game for a total of 28 percent of its points, the NCAA says.
Of the 316 teams, Gonzaga is the most accurate. Since 2000, Gonzaga has shot 38.2 percent from the line, compared to the average of 34.7 percent.
Of all Division I teams, however, none has been more low key about the 3-point shot than Texas Tech. Since 2000, the team has shot 8,700 3-pointers (the average is 10,171), scoring just 22 percent of its points from deep shots.
Knight, who coached Texas Tech from 2001 to 2008 after a 30-year career at IU, was opposed to the introduction of the 3-point shot from the beginning. That's despite the fact he won the 1987 national championship thanks, in part, to having Steve Alford, who hit 53.0 percent of his 3s in his only season with the shot. In 2005, when 33 percent of the shots attempted across college basketball were 3-pointers, Knight's Texas Tech team attempted just 19.6 percent.
"I've never been in favor of it," Knight told George Schroeder of The Oklahoman in 2007. "I think it's done a lot to take away from basic fundamental offense."
Indiana 3-point accolades When it comes to standing out in the 3-point realm, Indiana has some bragging rights.
Rotnei Clarke, who played his final season at Butler after transferring from Arkansas, still holds a spot in the top 25 3-point shooters in Division I basketball. Clarke made 389 of his 935 attempts averaging a career 41.6 percent from 3-point range.
Belmont has made the most 3-point shots, 5,449, of any Division I NCAA team since 2000.

Texto completo: The Forward was where I decided to be a reporter - a "newspaperman," Seth Lipsky would have insisted, and certainly not a "journalist," which he defined as "an out-of-work newspaperman."
Though his English-language Forward had been around for only eight years when I arrived, Seth carried the confidence of a great editor aware that he stood in a great tradition. I'm a thoroughly secularized half-Jew and knew almost nothing of the tradition of Yiddish political journalism, so I raced to learn: I enrolled in a weekly Yiddish class downstairs at the Workman's Circle/Arbiter Ring building, and I devoured the Penguin Classic translation of "The Rise of David Levinsky."
And, mostly, I learned: from the managing editor, Ira Stoll, who taught me what's still the only real way I know how to edit a story, by brutally rewriting it, and from, in particular, an ambitious young reporter named Elissa Gootman, who would go on to work for The New York Times and whose beat was Jewish organizations. It was a sleepy world of people who weren't used to being challenged, and you could just feel how irritated the officers of these organizations were to have a ponytailed intern coming by for their 990s. It was my first, small, palpable sense of the unstoppable, asymmetric place of journalism in challenging power.
I also fell in love with political reporting at the Forward: I covered the campaign of an ambitious young lawyer, Eric Schneiderman, for the state Senate. My big scoop - and, I should admit, my first receipt of opposition research - was that Schneiderman had received an illegal donation, through a company, from a Saudi prince, though in those pre-internet days I was never quite able to figure out the prince's place in the royal family.
And I made the sort of mistake you make only once, and probably have to make once: I sloppily got the surname of the subject of a glowing profile totally wrong. He was appalled; I still cringe when I recall it.
Seth was the looming eminence of the place back then, and I realize that I can't really remember what I learned from him as a reporter; I do recall that he tried, to my mother's horror, to make me forgo my senior year at Yale and remain at the Forward.
But when I got this job at BuzzFeed, Seth was among my first calls. I realized in retrospect - I'd worked for him at the New York Sun after my Forward internship - that I'd learned from him most of what I needed to know about editing: about how so much good reporting hits the political conversation, and should; about the importance of a clear headline and lede, and most of all - really above anything else - about the importance of standing by your reporters when they get into the inevitable scrapes, even when it's just the intern getting yelled at for having been a little aggressive in requesting a foundation's 990s. For a time, by coincidence, BuzzFeed sublet an apartment on the 10th floor of a converted building near Seward Park. We used the space as our test kitchen, but it had once been - Seth alleged - the composing room of the Forward. The presses had been in the basement. The view north is still unobstructed, and you can clearly feel how the institution towered over its quarter of the city in its time. It was the great media startup of its day, something with an urgency, a range and a connection to its audience to which those of us in the business now can aspire.
Ben Smith is the editor in chief of Buzzfeed.

Texto completo: La cadena de comida rápida Burger King está ofreciendo en pruebas una hamburguesa vegetariana, llamada “Impossible Whopper”, en 59 restaurantes de la ciudad de St. Louis, con miras a expandir esta opción en sus menús de todo el país, informa este lunes The New York Times.
Se trata de una curiosa colaboración entre Burger King y la empresa Impossible Foods , conocida por haber creado una hamburguesa hecha con vegetales y con la proteína “heme”, que imita incluso el “sangrado” que luce el producto de carne de ternera habitual.
Según dijo al diario el jefe de marketing de la cadena, Fernando Machado, ni clientes ni empleados logran diferenciar la hamburguesa de carne de la vegetariana y esta opción podría pasar de ser un “nicho” de mercado a un negocio en sí para la firma.
Machado indicó que Burger King ha visto incrementarse el número de consumidores que quieren comer menos carne, especialmente procedente de ternera, y la “Impossible Whopper” permitiría satisfacer esa demanda sin “comprometer el sabor”.
La versión vegetariana de la hamburguesa tiene aproximadamente el mismo valor proteínico que la tradicional Whopper , pero un 15 % menos de grasa y un 90 % menos de colesterol respecto a la estrella de la cadena, de acuerdo al NYT.
El presidente de Burger King Norteamérica, Chris Finazzo, dijo a CNN que la firma espera “dar a quien quiera comer una hamburguesa todos los días, pero no necesariamente quiera comer ternera, permiso para venir a los restaurantes más frecuentemente”.
Yes, the Impossible #Whopper does taste this good. Thank you @DAVID_Miami_ for such a great Ad campaign! #marketing #advertising pic.twitter.com/unxtIAJHua

Por su parte, David Lee, el jefe financiero y de operaciones de Impossible Foods, una “startup” de Silicon Valley, indicó que pese a tener sus productos ya introducidos en unos 6,000 restaurantes del país, la alianza con Burger King supone un “hito” porque está “a una escala diferente”.
En un vídeo promocional del “test” publicado en su canal de YouTube corporativo, Burger King dice reunir a algunos de sus clientes más leales y les ofrece la hamburguesa vegetariana sin que sepan que no es de carne, ante lo que reaccionan con incredulidad asegurando que sabe como la “Whopper” original .

Coincidiendo con el día de “April Fool’s” en EE.UU., en el que abundan las bromas en los medios nacionales, muchos no se han tomado en serio la noticia, pese a que se están sumando a la tendencia de ofrecer opciones sin carne en los menús otras cadenas de comida rápida como Taco Bell o Chipotle.

Texto completo: Ride-sharing giant Lyft had its initial public offering (IPO) last week. Archrival Uber and other big-name, billion-dollar techies should follow soon. Investors see big bucks: They'll buy an IPO and ride the next Amazon to unfathomed heights.
In the 1980s, that dream meant getting in on the ground floor of the next Apple. Now it’s the next Google or Facebook.
My advice: Don’t waste your time – or money.
In my 1987 book, "The Wall Street Waltz," I detailed why IPO really means "It’s Probably Overpriced. "
Thirty-two years and one huge dot-com crash later, many missed the memo. Folks only remember the super winners like Apple and Intel. They forget the flame-outs like Pets. com, Webvan and, well, the majority. Average all IPOs, and returns are sad. Early booms usually bust.
Few winners
University of Florida professor Jay Ritter studied IPOs launching from 1980 through 2017. The facts? After the initial pop, IPOs trailed similarly sized peers by an average 3. 3 percent a year over their first five years. As with most speculative investments, a few winners mask legions of laggards.
IPOs often rise out of the gate, sometimes hugely. Thank investment bankers for that. Those handling the IPO get big bucks for hyping the sale and attracting buyers. So they whip up a mindless frenzy. The excitement and lure of magic returns suck in otherwise rational folks. The party can last days, even weeks, as stories of quick gains attract suckers who hate missing out. But when it stops, the stocks often get clobbered. Even long-term winners like Apple and Facebook spent time in the wilderness after debuting.
Looking for a home? Where the most affordable housing market, least expensive homes are in each state
The downside of Social Security: Social Security is a lifesaver but far from perfect. Here are 3 rules we hate
One problem: The companies’ and buyers’ incentives aren’t aligned. An IPO has two main purposes: raising money and giving early backers a big payday. That requires a high price – too high, usually, to be priced well for buyers. Even when the price does pop, by the time retail investors can buy, the new stock has typically changed hands several times, eating up much of your potential gain. The early birds got the worm.
No stock bubble
That IPOs over-price is actually good news for investors now. It is abnormal, relative to history, to have so many huge companies that haven’t "IPOed" yet. How long have we heard Lyft, Uber and Airbnb IPO chatter? Years! That’s bullish for stocks overall. That the entire group of them in recent years didn't find fancy pricing on public markets tells you stocks weren’t overvalued. No bubble here.
The presumed 2019 IPO rush isn’t reason to sell, though. Yes, IPOs often frenzy near market peaks. But when quality firms with strong sales and business plans first start going public in numbers, it signals a healthy latter-stage bull market. The dangerous time is when investment bankers are pushing slop with scant sales or hopes of ready profits. The 1990s demonstrated this.
A new way to avoid robocalls: Verizon adds free 'Call Filter' feature in bid to fight robocalls
How to save $360 bucks: How to cut the cord and save around $360 a year
According to Ritter, IPO issuance peaked in 1996, with 677 new offerings. By 2000, when stocks peaked, there were only 380 IPOs. The difference? Those mid-1990s IPOs were higher-quality firms, overall and on average. The few big successes among them drove a mania for more IPOs, leading to the late-decade slop crop, when new issues blew their cash more often than Austin Powers said, “Groovy baby. ”
Today’s impending IPOs aren’t so scary, with positive cash flows and long-term business plans. Moreover, investors aren’t blinded by euphoria. There is more than abundant skepticism now – about everything.
But instead of gambling on IPOs, just own stocks. Benefit from the bull market that inspires IPOs. Be an investor, not a speculator.

What will Democrats do with dud Mueller report?

Texto completo: When, on May 17, 2017, the Justice Department named former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to oversee the investigation into the Trump campaign and possible collusion with the Russians, The New York Times virtually hailed it as a triumph of democracy. Mueller was described in the most glowing of terms with words like "unblemished," "credible," "exacting," and as a man "who is credited with building the modern FBI."
For more than 675 days, we have been subjected to a steady drip of leaks, endless Russia collusion coverage and the suggestion that Trump was the Manchurian — ur, I mean, the Russian — candidate who was sent to assassinate American democracy as we know it. Whenever there was no news on the Mueller front, we could always expect Stormy Daniels to be given extensive coverage. Mueller's investigation into Trump's alleged wrongdoing would be the long-awaited answer to Hillary Clinton's book, "What Happened."
Only it wasn't.
Or, more precisely, it was; it just wasn't the answer Democrats wanted — or should I say, it wasn't the answer Democrats needed? On the same day that Mueller was appointed special counsel, Trump issued this: "As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know — there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity."
Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report indicates this is precisely what happened, which is highly problematic for Democrats. Having put their proverbial eggs in the Russia collusion basket, the Mueller report is an anticlimactic ending to an epic buildup.
And this is where it gets uncomfortable for Democrats. Because they have continually endorsed Mueller as the font of integrity ruthlessly searching for the truth, it now becomes more than a little awkward to condemn the results of his investigation. What do they do now?
For the moment, Democrats appear to have a two-pronged strategy:
First, launch yet another Trump investigation. "The Mueller report is one document," declared Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia. "It is not, however, the final word on ongoing investigations, criminal or otherwise." Reps. Maxine Waters of California and Eliot Engel of New York remain equally defiant.
Second, they are attacking Attorney General Barr for not releasing the full report. This enables them to continue doing what they have done throughout the Mueller investigation: Hint that the Trump campaign did indeed do something sinister, but it just hasn't been revealed to the public. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler is, for instance, already suggesting a "cover-up."
Both strategies are inherently risky.
In the first instance, Democrats run the risk of giving Trump victim status by appearing to be on a witch hunt. If Mueller found nothing on this president after more than $25 million, two years of investigation and 34 indictments, the public may deem that enough.
In the second instance, the strategy can work only so long as the attorney general does not release the report or, if he does, it is found to contain the hoped-for smoking gun. If, however, Barr releases the report and his summary proves to be accurate enough, this strategy fails, too.
With the nuclear option off the table for now at least, Democrats are suddenly on the defensive.
They might have unwittingly ensured Trump's re-election.

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert Mueller had become something of a messiah figure to the Trump haters. Like a god, he was remote, white-haired and reputed to work miracles. But Mueller ultimately disappointed his worshipers, establishing none of the Russian collusion they had been banking on to bolster their efforts to overturn the 2016 election.
The Russian collusion story had been an article of faith for the Resistance and the press. But why were so many people so deeply convinced of something that was not true? Who was behind not only concocting this fantastic tale but also embedding it in the highest levels of the Justice Department, the intelligence community and the news media?
This question had been on hold during the Mueller investigation. Government officials could not dig into it because anything they might do publicly would have been denounced as interference or “obstruction. ” But with the Mueller phase concluded, the gates have opened.
Read more commentary:
Mueller investigation was never about maintaining integrity; it's about sustaining Trump hysteria
Mueller fallout: Trump should focus on Russian aggression, not his supposed 'exoneration'
Without Mueller-report smoking gun, Democrats may have ensured Trump’s re-election
President Trump retweeted a link about a Wall Street Journal op-ed saying the Obama administration must account for “abuse of surveillance powers. ” “Time to investigate the Obama officials who concocted and spread the Russian conspiracy hoax!” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. , tweeted. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , called for the appointment of a new special counsel. And former George W. Bush administration spokesman Ari Fleischer asked what could be the ultimate question, “What did Barack Obama know and what and when did he authorize it?”
How Obama's team targeted Trump
The Russia investigation did not come from nothing, of course. Moscow did try to influence the 2016 election, part of a long history of attempted involvement in American politics going back to the days of the Comintern. This Russian activity prompted President Obama to tell Vladimir Putin personally to “cut it out” or face “serious consequences. ” And the FBI gave the Trump campaign a standard counterintelligence briefing on the possibility of foreign interference in the summer of 2016, multiple government sources told NBC News and CNN.
Yet Obama officials also treated Trump campaign staffers as targets themselves. They used cooperative foreign intelligence services to chat them up overseas, both to put a layer of deniability between them and this questionable behavior, and to get around prohibitions against spying on American citizens. The recently released transcript of the House Committee on the Judiciary and Committee on Government Reform and Oversight interview with Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos goes into great detail how this targeting was conducted. Papadopoulos claims that foreign governments are now cooperating to reveal more about these activities.
There are also numerous classified documents related to the collusion illusion that have been either hidden or released in severely redacted form. Last September, President Trump instructed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice immediately to declassify materials related to the Russia investigation, including “all text messages … without redaction” of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page and Bruce Ohr, as well as documents concerning the warrant application under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act for Trump adviser Carter Page.
Democrats objected that declassifying text messages regarding the Russia investigation will compromise FBI “sources and methods,” and the move was delayed after "key allies" objected.
Sources and methods must be known
However, sources and methods are the central question when it comes to investigating the investigators. So far as methods are concerned, what we know about them already are hardly worth being classified. They involve a basic counterintelligence technique, getting people to talk. In the Carter Page case, the target was a marginal character on the periphery of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. This is not exactly on the level of the previously classified methods revealed by Edward Snowden.
But if there were some highly technical, super secret surveillance methods being used against others, including Trump himself, it is imperative that they be revealed. The notion that the U. S. government was ordered to use such advanced tools against a major party presidential campaign or a president himself is to say the least troubling, and potentially a criminal abuse of power.
Sources, likewise, should not remain concealed. Their identity is the central question of the investigation. Republicans maintain that the Carter Page FISA warrant was almost entirely based on the discredited Fusion GPS “Russia dossier,” which was bankrolled by the Clinton-run Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.
Yet former National Intelligence Director James Clapper claims that the sketchy dossier was not the main source. OK then, what was? Settling this question publicly is more important than protecting any alleged source. The country was on the verge of a grave constitutional crisis that far outweighed this narrow, and perhaps nonexistent, protection rationale. It’s time to have cards on the table.
Many revelations from this investigation to date have given dramatic weight to the idea that the FBI and intelligence community were engaged in an effort to derail the 2016 Trump presidential campaign and later to use an “insurance policy” to subvert the Trump presidency. It is pointless to continue to argue about this in the dark. If there is evidence that supports the Democrats’ charges in these redacted documents, why not let the public know? Hiding behind “sources and methods” won’t cut it.
Trump should declassify these secrets
Last August, former CIA Director John Brennan on Meet the Press called President Trump’s behavior “treasonous, which is to betray one’s trust and to aiding and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim. ” Now he contritely admits that he might have relied on “bad information. ” But Brennan was at the center of the collusion myth from the beginning. He had received “bad information” regarding Russian efforts to penetrate the Trump campaign from foreign intelligence sources dating back to 2015.
Early 2016, Brennan convened an interagency task force at Langley that included representatives from the CIA, the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, the Justice Department, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Agency. Obama administration officials compiled a list of the key classified documents from this investigation after the 2016 election out of fear that the incoming Trump team would destroy them, according to The New York Times. So where is this list and where are the documents? Who was involved in Brennan’s working group, and were any of them coordinating with the Clinton campaign?
President Trump already has the authority to declassify much of this hidden information. In the spring of 2017, when the president charged that former national security adviser Susan Rice’s “unmasking” of U. S. persons in intelligence products was potentially criminal, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said, “If he’s going to make accusations of criminality against anyone, he needs to show evidence to support that kind of a charge. ” Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , added that “if the president wants to say that Susan Rice committed a crime, he has the power to declassify. No one else does. ”
Couldn’t agree more.
It is probable that the full Mueller report goes into some of these issues, but it is likely that more investigation will need to be done. Democrats calling for transparency should be careful what they wish for. We are looking at what might be an unprecedented level of government interference in the 2016 election that makes Watergate look like a third-rate burglary.

Texto completo: Labels lead to extremism
Two political labels one often sees nowadays are conservative and liberal, and they are often used as derisive epithets when launched by the opposite view. The definitions for those labels are actually multifaceted, but without discernment one's concept of each can be shaped by politicians, media and pundits looking to boost agenda support or viewership/readership. In doing that, selected examples of liberal and conservative may come from the outer fringes or gross extrapolations of someone's actions or words. The results are definitions of each on the far, perhaps fictional, ends of the spectrum. The vast majority of us are not at those extremes.
In fact, many of us may be a blend of liberal and conservative views. I certainly am. Depending upon the issue I could be labeled conservative or liberal, and thereby I am stuffed into one of those tight little labeled cans on either end of the political spectrum. The trend toward making political labels purely left or right is inaccurate. We all probably have more commonality than not.

Work to reduce use of force
The Police Use of Force Project is an initiative that came together after the Ferguson, Mo., protests to research and recommend solutions to end police killings. Their research showed that police departments that implement stricter use-of-force regulations kill significantly fewer people. Look online for more. For the 100 largest U.S. cities, they examined police policies on these attributes:
Require officers to de-escalate situations before resorting to force.
Limit the kinds of force that can be used to respond to specific forms of resistance.
Restrict chokeholds.
Require officers to give verbal warning before using force.
Prohibit officers from shooting at moving vehicles.
Require officers to exhaust all alternatives to deadly force.
Require officers to stop colleagues from exercising excessive force.
Require comprehensive reporting on use of force.
The policies of the Vancouver Police Department and Clark County Sheriff's Office should be examined for these policies, and those that are missing should be implemented using appropriate training including simulations. I also concur with others who demand cultural competency training and both body-worn and dashboard cameras. Cameras will not necessarily deter inappropriate use of force, but they will provide impartial information.

Tax breaks don't add up
I understand that the vice president complained that the Green New Deal would cost the taxpayers. In my opinion he is absolutely right. The only problem is that he and his party loyalists have removed the wealthiest from paying taxes with their gross tax giveaways and shelters to the extent that one could exclude them from being described as taxpayers.
However, it seems that tax giveaways are not restricted to the federal government. Our locals seem to be in on the act too when for a half-million dollars they intend to give a tax break of almost five times that amount so they can replace playground equipment at Esther Short Park.
Do you, like me, see a problem here?

Shame on Trump supporters
The following concerns Trump and those who support him:
The majority of Trump's promises, when he was a candidate, were lies. They are too numerous to mention, but he reiterated time and time again that Mexico would pay for the wall; he promised not to touch Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security; and he promised to show his tax returns if elected. He has been reported to have lied thousands of times since taking office.
I could go on and on about his pathological lying that, I am sure, we are all aware of.
What I fail to understand is that despite his lies, racist behavior, disrespect of women, possible Russian connections and admiration of dictators, that there are those of you that still support him. For what reason?
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. To those Trump supporters … shame on you!

Democrats flame out
Let me tell you how I see the Democrats and the Mueller report. Way back in 2016, a left observer was looking out and saw a huge pile of very wet wood. One was a large log and the remainder were smaller pieces and a bunch of limbs. The new day brought out the sun and from the pile of wood vapor started to rise. Now the Democrat thought this was a sign from heaven, thinking it was smoke.
Getting the rest of the left all excited they started poking around for the fire. They poked and poked, spending some $25 million looking for the fire and came up with nothing.
Since the special counsel did not find anything that met their needs and the “no” fire went out, it was about time to really get this pile of wood going. Somehow Mueller missed something, but by golly we have the right kind of match now to get this pile really going, and in stepped Rep. Adam Schiff. I guess the only thing that will save the pile is the 2020 election.

Mueller report must be public
People are trying to make sense of the Mueller report. The New York Times led with the headline “Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy.” What we are overlooking is that all we know about Mueller's report is what we have been told by Trump's hand-picked Attorney General William P. Barr. It is nothing more than his interpretation. But, has the White House ever misinterpreted anything in the past? The Trump team wouldn't lie to us, would they? We need to have Mueller's findings made public so we aren't being told what it says by a Trump flunky.

Texto completo: As the Democratic Party quarrels over reparations for slavery, a new and related issue has arisen, raised by the president of Mexico.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has written Pope Francis I and King Felipe VI to demand their apologies for the Spanish conquest of Mexico that began 500 years ago with the "invasion" of Hernando Cortez. Arriving on the Gulf Coast in 1519, Cortes marched in two years to what is today's Mexico City to impose Spanish rule, the Spanish language and culture, and the Catholic faith.
"One culture, one civilization was imposed upon another," wrote President Lopez Obrador: "There were massacres and oppression. The so-called conquest was waged with the sword and the cross. They built their churches on top of the temples."
He demanded that the king and the pope ask for "forgiveness for the abuses inflicted on the indigenous peoples of Mexico."
Now no one denies that great sins and crimes were committed in that conquest. But are not the Mexican people, 130 million of them, far better off because the Spanish came and overthrew the Aztec Empire?
Did not 300 years of Spanish rule and replacement of Mexico's pagan cults with the Catholic faith lead to enormous advances for its civilization and human rights? Or is there never a justification for one nation to invade another, conquer its people, impose its rule, and uproot and replace its culture and civilization? Is "cultural genocide" always a crime against humanity, even if the uprooted culture countenanced human sacrifice?
Did the Aztecs have a right to be left alone by the European world? If so, whence came that right? Which leads to another question: Are all civilizations and cultures equal, or are some more equal than others? Are some superior?
Before recent decades, most Americans were taught to believe the West stood above all other civilizations, and America was its supreme manifestation. And much of the world seemed to agree.
As for the assertion that all civilizations and cultures are equal, that is an ideological statement. But where is the historic, scientific or empirical evidence to support that proposition? How many people really believe that?
Spain's Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said it was "weird to receive now this request for an apology for events that occurred 500 years ago." He wondered if Spain should seek an apology from France for the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula and crimes committed by the armies of Napoleon, or if France could demand an apology from Italy for the invasion of Gaul by Julius Caesar?
Lopez Obrador may do better with Pope Francis, who is into begging for forgiveness for
crimes committed in the
Spanish-Portuguese conquest of South America.
As The New York Times related in its story on the "chilly response" in Madrid to Mexico's demand, other Western leaders - not only Barack Obama - are very much into this apology fad. Justin Trudeau has apologized for Canada's mistreatment of its indigenous peoples. France's Emmanuel Macron has apologized for the torture of rebels in Algeria's war for independence.
The Spanish right, however, is not with the program. Alberto Rivera, leader of the Ciudadanos, called Lopez Obrador's demand "an intolerable offense to the Spanish people."
Behind this demand for an apology from Spain and the Church is a view of history familiar to Americans, and rooted in clashing concepts about who we are, and were.
Have the Western peoples who conquered and changed much of the world been, on balance, a blessing to mankind or a curse? Is the history of the West, though replete with the failings of all civilizations, not unique in the greatness of what it produced? Or are the West's crimes of imperialism, colonialism, genocide, racism, slavery and maltreatment of minorities of color so sweeping, hateful and shameful they cancel out the good done?
As we see the monuments and memorials to the great men of our past desecrated and dragged down, the verdict among a slice of our intellectual and cultural elites is already in. Thumbs down. They agree with the moral shakedown artist of Mexico City.
Query: Can peoples who are ashamed of their nation's past do great things in its future? Or is a deep-seated national guilt, such as that which afflicts many Germans today, a permanent incapacitating feature of a nation's existence?

Mueller's timing is a dodged bullet

Texto completo: Last week, special counsel Robert Mueller delivered his findings in the Russia investigation to the Justice Department. On Sunday, Attorney General William Barr released his summary of what he said were Mueller's findings: Donald Trump and his associates were not guilty of conspiring with the Russians in the 2016 presidential election, but a conclusion was not made on whether the president had obstructed justice.
While Trump's supporters were ecstatic, his opponents were crestfallen.
But as one of the people fervently opposed to the abomination of the Trump presidency and Trumpism in general, I saw in Mueller's timing a dodged bullet.
We don't know yet what Mueller's actual report says or the degree to which his findings are damaging or exculpatory to Trump. But, assuming that the report roughly aligns with what Barr wrote, Trump's opponents should be thanking their lucky stars that Mueller filed his report nearly 600 days before the presidential election, long before all of the Democratic candidates have even declared their candidacy, long before the first debates.
Imagine if these results were released later on, after candidates had locked in speculative statements about what the report would say and mean. Imagine it coming later, when it could truly give a campaign boost to Trump.
Will Trump use these findings as a campaign mantra? Of course. But in 600 days so much else will have happened that these results will no longer be front of mind.
Imagine if Trump had said after the summary was released: America, for two years the specter of this investigation has loomed over my presidency and the country. Now that the results are in, let's try to accept them and move forward in a spirit of reconciliation and common good. I know that some of you don't agree with me or my methods, but I have your best interest at heart. I have America's best interest at heart. Let's do our best to find unity and agreement wherever we can and to disagree in grace wherever we can't. America, let's get to work.
It would have cost him none of his base, and it could have won over a portion of the middle, maybe enough of it to secure a 2020 victory.
But that's not what he did.
Instead, he began immediately hinting at retribution, saying, "There are a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, some bad things, I would say some treasonous things against our country." He said that some of those people "will certainly be looked at."
Trump has no idea how to ride a win. He seems to see every news cycle as him starting from scratch. He couldn't even let the Mueller findings breathe before suffocating them. Within days, the Trump administration reversed itself on an Affordable Care Act lawsuit, announcing that it now supports a complete court-ordered annihilation of the law. For millions of Americans dependent on this act, it repositioned Trump as the destroyer and Democrats as their protectors.
The gun with which Trump keeps shooting himself in the foot has an extended clip. He will continue to do this because that's what he does. By the time the election comes around, the Mueller report will be but a footnote.
Perform this thought experiment: Try to remember what the big news was around last March 24, a year ago last Sunday. You can't. Let me remind you.
We were in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. The massive "March for Our Lives" happened on March 24. On March 23, Trump pledged in a tweet:
"Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns."
As if to change the subject by jumping onto another cultural issue, also on March 23 of last year, the Trump administration issued a memo saying "that transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria - individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery - are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances."
I point all this out simply to say that memories fade.
Following that logic, Mueller did the Resistance a huge favor by issuing his report soon after the midterms and well in advance of the 2020 elections.
The Department of Justice has a 60-day rule about not issuing reports and filing charges too close before an election so as not to influence it. But this is more precisely a 60-day "rule of thumb," because as Politico reported in August, "A report from the Justice Department's inspector general in June found that the oft-discussed 60-day rule is not written or described in any Department policy or regulation.'"
Still, Mueller didn't give the Resistance 60 days but nearly 600. That is a blessing if ever there was one.

Now more than ever, Wisconsin and the U.S. need 'wounded healers'

Texto completo: Editor's note: If you or someone you know is dealing with suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-8255 or text "Hopeline" to the National Crisis Text Line at 741-741.
From China to Europe, from India to South America, average suicide rates around the world have fallen 33 percent since 1990.
Not in the United States. American suicide rates are at their highest levels since the second world war, making suicide the second leading cause of death between ages 10-34, government data show.
The increase in suicides, combined with record levels of drug overdoses and alcohol-related fatalities, are so extreme that they're lowering the life expectancy of the average American. Mental health problems disable more American workers than any other affliction — suburban, rural or urban — and caregiver burnout and compassion fatigue are epidemic.
Not for generations, if ever, has a wounded nation needed its elite corps of "wounded healers."
They are the counselors, social workers and psychologists often best suited to accompany others on the path to recovery because they've already walked that path themselves.
They possess some of the most indispensable and in-demand therapeutic skills in the country, and by all accounts, they exist in sizable numbers. In a nation swimming against the global tide of improving mental health, these healers ought to be the heroes.
But few advertise what might be their strongest credential.
Instead, many appear to do their best work with quiet professional anonymity — except in moments of confidentially when their private story might help a struggling client.
"There are many like us," said Bart Andrews, a suicide attempt survivor who's a practicing psychologist and senior administrator at St. Louis-based Behavioral Health Response.
"We're really afraid to tell our stories because we're afraid we're going to lose our jobs," Andrews told a suicide survivor site called Live Through This, in a 2015 interview shortly after his first public disclosure. "People are going to take our degrees away. They're going to take our licenses away. They're going to think I'm not a good therapist."
The mental health field professes to want to de-stigmatize the shame and stereotypes that isolate many who struggle, he said, and yet the same taboos reach far into the corridors of institutional providers.
Surprisingly few "come out," said Stacey Freedenthal, a Colorado psychotherapist and associate professor at the University of Denver Graduate School of Social Work.
"Some people cannot take the risk of revealing their mental illness, suicidality, or other vulnerabilities. They might be fired, or discriminated against, or hurt in other ways," said Freedenthal, also a suicide attempt survivor.
Knowledge beyond a diploma Unsung and unheralded, their occupation seems like a contradiction — mental health professionals who lived through mental illness, drug and alcohol counselors who lived through dependency, suicide intervention therapists who survived their own attempts.
"Theories and interpretations are not much help in the terrifying depths of the psyche," Kathryn Larisey, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, wrote in her 2012 article "The Wounded Healer."
Many have diplomas and licenses but rely on knowledge no doctoral degree can confer. From drugs to depression, they make a uniquely convincing case that people can and do recover — even when their clients are nowhere near it.
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, a pioneer in modern psychology, coined the term "wounded healer" more than a century ago. He meant it as a badge of honor, a tribute. It remains in use: "My name is Dr. Paul Epstein and I'm a wounded healer," begins one therapist's blog post.
But some balk at the title. To them, the word "wounded" smacks of impairment or deficiency. "I hate the 'wounded provider' metaphor and cringe when I hear folks use it," Andrews said in an interview.
Whatever they're called, their numbers spill out beyond psychiatric hospitals and clinics. Within non-profits and social agencies, many prefer to be called "peer specialist" or "recovery coach." In the 12-step recovery programs of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, they're "sponsors." For those who served in war zones, they're fellow vets.
The most accepted term is a practitioner "with lived experience."
Camilo Delgado, a Florida-based psychotherapist and international mental health consultant, prefers the term "alchemist" — someone who can transform pain into purpose.
'Post-traumatic growth' To be sure, just because people have crash-and-burn stories of their own hardly qualifies them as competent healers. Therapists preoccupied with their own traumas aren't much help to others. But those who have mastered their own alchemy can possess therapeutic superpowers.
"Someone doesn't have to have been suicidal to help suicidal people, but there can be gifts in the experience," Freedenthal said.
At Rogers Memorial Hospital in metro Milwaukee, psychologist Sarah Reed prefers to speak of "post-traumatic growth" — not the more common diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
In videos and workshops, Reed has disclosed her own history of an eating disorder, depression and anxiety. "It often gives me more clout than my degree and education," said Reed, who holds a doctorate in community psychology.
Therapeutic storytelling can be transformative for those who open up and for those who hear the stories, according to a consensus of recovered healers.
Reed conducts workshops to help young adults safely write their own narratives, using guidelines written by recovered healers. Young people sort the costs and benefits of sharing their stories, weighing how much to share and with whom — and only in situations that will be helpful.
"People with lived experience are absolutely necessary and undervalued," Reed said.
Out of the 'closet' It took Freedenthal 22 years to break her silence. Her own suicide attempt took place in her first year of graduate school. "Professionally, it seemed too much of a liability for people to know," Freedenthal wrote on her webpage.
In 2017, she published a short memoir in the New York Times ("A Suicide Therapist's Secret Past"). She followed up with a "coming out" essay on her website ("The longer I hid that I myself had been intensely suicidal, the more hypocritical I felt.")
As the feedback poured in, she discovered how many others like her anonymously populate clinics and psychiatric hospitals. Scores wrote to her — some in training to start their careers, some in mid-career, and many who kept their recovery stories secret all the way to retirement. The statistics bear out what she found:
A 2009 survey found that 87 percent of psychology graduate students reported experiencing anxiety; 68 percent reported symptoms of depression; 19 percent reported suicidal thoughts, according to the American Psychological Association.
A survey conducted at a U.S. workshop for clinical psychology trainees found that 59 percent had experienced suicidal ideation and 5 percent at one point actually had a plan to carry it out, according to the New School Psychology Bulletin in 2015.
An anonymous web survey of 678 British clinical psychologists found that two–thirds "had experienced mental health problems themselves." The same survey found that many didn't want to disclose due to shame and career consequences, reported the Journal of Clinical Psychology in 2018.
The impact of economic disruption Serious mental health challenges continue to rise in the U.S.
In 2017, deaths from alcohol, drugs and suicide hit their highest levels in both Wisconsin and nationally since federal data collection began in 1999. The increases in Wisconsin are slightly higher than the national average, according to a Journal Sentinel analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The epidemic of mental and behavioral health afflictions defies simple explanations. But studies are consistent on one point: Exposure to traumatic assault, abuse and abandonment increase amid economic disruption. That leads to an increase in post-traumatic disorders including mental afflictions, addictions, aggression, homelessness and suicide.
However many recovered healers already exist, there aren't enough.
Acute shortages of social workers and counselors are well documented, particularly in rural regions. Of Wisconsin's 72 counties, 48 lack even one practicing child psychiatrist, according to the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.
"More of these healers and mental health professionals would greatly improve our mental health situation in the U.S," Delgado said.
John Schmid reports on how Wisconsin's people and communities are confronting the impact of globalization and economic disruption for the Journal Sentinel's Ideas Lab. Beginning with a 2017 series called, A Time to Heal, and then with multiple follow-up stories, he interviewed scores of social service and mental health practitioners. Email: john.schmid@jrn.com.

Texto completo: Editor's note: If you or someone you know is dealing with suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-8255 or text "Hopeline" to the National Crisis Text Line at 741-741.
From China to Europe, from India to South America, average suicide rates around the world have fallen 33 percent since 1990.
Not in the United States. American suicide rates are at their highest levels since the second world war, making suicide the second leading cause of death between ages 10-34, government data show.
The increase in suicides, combined with record levels of drug overdoses and alcohol-related fatalities, are so extreme that they're lowering the life expectancy of the average American. Mental health problems disable more American workers than any other affliction — suburban, rural or urban — and caregiver burnout and compassion fatigue are epidemic.
Not for generations, if ever, has a wounded nation needed its elite corps of "wounded healers."
They are the counselors, social workers and psychologists often best suited to accompany others on the path to recovery because they've already walked that path themselves.
They possess some of the most indispensable and in-demand therapeutic skills in the country, and by all accounts, they exist in sizable numbers. In a nation swimming against the global tide of improving mental health, these healers ought to be the heroes.
But few advertise what might be their strongest credential.
Instead, many appear to do their best work with quiet professional anonymity — except in moments of confidentially when their private story might help a struggling client.
"There are many like us," said Bart Andrews, a suicide attempt survivor who's a practicing psychologist and senior administrator at St. Louis-based Behavioral Health Response.
"We're really afraid to tell our stories because we're afraid we're going to lose our jobs," Andrews told a suicide survivor site called Live Through This, in a 2015 interview shortly after his first public disclosure. "People are going to take our degrees away. They're going to take our licenses away. They're going to think I'm not a good therapist."
The mental health field professes to want to de-stigmatize the shame and stereotypes that isolate many who struggle, he said, and yet the same taboos reach far into the corridors of institutional providers.
Surprisingly few "come out," said Stacey Freedenthal, a Colorado psychotherapist and associate professor at the University of Denver Graduate School of Social Work.
"Some people cannot take the risk of revealing their mental illness, suicidality, or other vulnerabilities. They might be fired, or discriminated against, or hurt in other ways," said Freedenthal, also a suicide attempt survivor.
Knowledge beyond a diploma Unsung and unheralded, their occupation seems like a contradiction — mental health professionals who lived through mental illness, drug and alcohol counselors who lived through dependency, suicide intervention therapists who survived their own attempts.
"Theories and interpretations are not much help in the terrifying depths of the psyche," Kathryn Larisey, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, wrote in her 2012 article "The Wounded Healer."
Many have diplomas and licenses but rely on knowledge no doctoral degree can confer. From drugs to depression, they make a uniquely convincing case that people can and do recover — even when their clients are nowhere near it.
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, a pioneer in modern psychology, coined the term "wounded healer" more than a century ago. He meant it as a badge of honor, a tribute. It remains in use: "My name is Dr. Paul Epstein and I'm a wounded healer," begins one therapist's blog post.
But some balk at the title. To them, the word "wounded" smacks of impairment or deficiency. "I hate the 'wounded provider' metaphor and cringe when I hear folks use it," Andrews said in an interview.
Whatever they're called, their numbers spill out beyond psychiatric hospitals and clinics. Within non-profits and social agencies, many prefer to be called "peer specialist" or "recovery coach." In the 12-step recovery programs of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, they're "sponsors." For those who served in war zones, they're fellow vets.
The most accepted term is a practitioner "with lived experience."
Camilo Delgado, a Florida-based psychotherapist and international mental health consultant, prefers the term "alchemist" — someone who can transform pain into purpose.
'Post-traumatic growth' To be sure, just because people have crash-and-burn stories of their own hardly qualifies them as competent healers. Therapists preoccupied with their own traumas aren't much help to others. But those who have mastered their own alchemy can possess therapeutic superpowers.
"Someone doesn't have to have been suicidal to help suicidal people, but there can be gifts in the experience," Freedenthal said.
At Rogers Memorial Hospital in metro Milwaukee, psychologist Sarah Reed prefers to speak of "post-traumatic growth" — not the more common diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
In videos and workshops, Reed has disclosed her own history of an eating disorder, depression and anxiety. "It often gives me more clout than my degree and education," said Reed, who holds a doctorate in community psychology.
Therapeutic storytelling can be transformative for those who open up and for those who hear the stories, according to a consensus of recovered healers.
Reed conducts workshops to help young adults safely write their own narratives, using guidelines written by recovered healers. Young people sort the costs and benefits of sharing their stories, weighing how much to share and with whom — and only in situations that will be helpful.
"People with lived experience are absolutely necessary and undervalued," Reed said.
Out of the 'closet' It took Freedenthal 22 years to break her silence. Her own suicide attempt took place in her first year of graduate school. "Professionally, it seemed too much of a liability for people to know," Freedenthal wrote on her webpage.
In 2017, she published a short memoir in the New York Times ("A Suicide Therapist's Secret Past"). She followed up with a "coming out" essay on her website ("The longer I hid that I myself had been intensely suicidal, the more hypocritical I felt.")
As the feedback poured in, she discovered how many others like her anonymously populate clinics and psychiatric hospitals. Scores wrote to her — some in training to start their careers, some in mid-career, and many who kept their recovery stories secret all the way to retirement. The statistics bear out what she found:
A 2009 survey found that 87 percent of psychology graduate students reported experiencing anxiety; 68 percent reported symptoms of depression; 19 percent reported suicidal thoughts, according to the American Psychological Association.
A survey conducted at a U.S. workshop for clinical psychology trainees found that 59 percent had experienced suicidal ideation and 5 percent at one point actually had a plan to carry it out, according to the New School Psychology Bulletin in 2015.
An anonymous web survey of 678 British clinical psychologists found that two–thirds "had experienced mental health problems themselves." The same survey found that many didn't want to disclose due to shame and career consequences, reported the Journal of Clinical Psychology in 2018.
The impact of economic disruption Serious mental health challenges continue to rise in the U.S.
In 2017, deaths from alcohol, drugs and suicide hit their highest levels in both Wisconsin and nationally since federal data collection began in 1999. The increases in Wisconsin are slightly higher than the national average, according to a Journal Sentinel analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The epidemic of mental and behavioral health afflictions defies simple explanations. But studies are consistent on one point: Exposure to traumatic assault, abuse and abandonment increase amid economic disruption. That leads to an increase in post-traumatic disorders including mental afflictions, addictions, aggression, homelessness and suicide.
However many recovered healers already exist, there aren't enough.
Acute shortages of social workers and counselors are well documented, particularly in rural regions. Of Wisconsin's 72 counties, 48 lack even one practicing child psychiatrist, according to the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.
"More of these healers and mental health professionals would greatly improve our mental health situation in the U.S," Delgado said.
John Schmid reports on how Wisconsin's people and communities are confronting the impact of globalization and economic disruption for the Journal Sentinel's Ideas Lab. Beginning with a 2017 series called, A Time to Heal, and then with multiple follow-up stories, he interviewed scores of social service and mental health practitioners. Email: john.schmid@jrn.com.

Texto completo: "The narrative of the story did not resonate with the mainstream."
Angie Chuang
University of Colorado at Boulder associate journalism professor
Columbine.
Newtown.
Fort Hood.
Aurora.
Charleston.
Virginia Tech.
Mass shooting locations read off with chilling familiarity.
Missing and almost forgotten among the communities that have suffered through the bloodshed is Binghamton.
What factors may have led many to forget the ACA shooting Not that the community wants to be solely identified by its own active shooter at an immigrant center that claimed the life of 13 victims 10 years ago.
But with each subsequent mass shooting, it seems the shocking incident that gripped this community in fear and mourning on a rainy and chilly Friday morning fades further from the nation's collective memory, creating a double tragedy for the innocent, many of whom were foreign nationals in an English class.
"The narrative of the story did not resonate with the mainstream," said Angie Chuang, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who has studied the media reaction to Binghamton's mass murder. "It was very much a perception of immigrants killing other immigrants."
Eleven of the 13 victims were from distant locales — China, Haiti and Iraq among them. Many of the mourning kin were out of reach for media interviews in the days following the shooting. Days after the Front Street scene was wiped clean, so was the searing impact of what was then one of the deadliest mass shootings in America — at least, in the eyes of the nation.
"I know a lot was said, maybe because they were immigrants, people didn't care as much," said Dr. Jeffrey King, son of Roberta "Bobbie" King, the beloved teacher who was targeted in the English as Second Language class. "I'm not so sure about that. I think it got diluted down as well because all of a sudden, (mass shootings) were happening every several months almost, a couple a year."
The American Civic Association killings were the seventh-deadliest shooting in U.S. history at the time, the same as Columbine High School. Today, it remains the 13th-deadliest mass shooting.
Each time a mass shooting occurs, media and politicians tick off a list of previous deadly killings, using shorthand like "Parkland" and "Aurora" to represent the horrors that occurred there. Binghamton is nearly always left off that list. The slight has mostly gone unnoticed beyond Binghamton, with one notable exception: Four years ago, The Boston Globe ran a front-page story headlined, "The deadliest mass shooting everyone forgot."
"In response to the shootings in San Bernardino, the New York Times published a historic op-ed titled 'End The Gun Epidemic In America' on its front page. It referenced, among others, the mass shootings in Colorado, Oregon and Charleston. It made no mention of Binghamton. Neither did editorials on gun violence in the Washington Post, L.A. Times and other major outlets," the Boston Globe writer observed.
Memories last long in Binghamton. The lives lost still bring a collective sting to longtime residents and relatives.
"At first, we started to realize, a few years out, after more and more shootings, all these articles were (saying), 'Oh, Columbine,' then Virginia Tech and Fort Hood and all this, and we're like, 'Wow, where are we?," King said. "We were one of the largest massacres at the time, you know — 13 people killed and others injured. And it actually really was very insulting, I mean, I was furious."
Barely 24 hours after shots rang out on April 3, 2009, at the American Civic Association, a horde of national media descended onto Binghamton to cover one of nation's most deadly mass shootings.
How the news may have influenced what's remembered National television networks and media outlets sprang into action, dispatching crews to bring news of the latest shooting tragedy to their viewers and readers. All the biggies were there: ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN. "Today" show reporters set up a temporary canopy just across the street from the ACA to update its audience on the latest developments on the morning following the shooting. Random residents were plucked off the street for reaction.
A crush of media attended the day-after news conference at City Hall, where then-Binghamton Mayor Matt Ryan spoke about the tragedy and Binghamton Police Chief Joseph Zikuski described the ugly scene.
Within a few days, the media gaggle dispersed, moving on to other stories. Out of the spotlight, Binghamton's hurt became just one of several.
"The bigger issue is that outside the central New York area, Binghamton was never a high news draw," said Jaclyn Schildkraut, associate professor of criminal justice at the State University College at Oswego, who studies mass shootings.
For America, the killings had become all too commonplace. The media's mass shooting drill was well-oiled. In the 10 years prior, there had been 13 mass shootings — Columbine and Virginia Tech among them — across the nation, claiming the lives of 116 and injuring 105.
If Binghamton didn't become eclipsed because of its size, then why? Since Binghamton, there have been 26 more active-shooter incidents in America. The death toll, 281; injured, 243. Several of those locations stand out, too: Tuscon, San Bernadino, Orlando, Fort Hood, Newtown and Charleston.
Binghamton has become little more than a footnote.
"These were poor immigrants in a poor town that had a Rust Belt vibe," said Chuang, trying to explain why the memory of Binghamton's tragedy has faded. "These were people that were affected — they've dealt with hardship before."
Once the immediacy of the tragedy fades, so does the collective attention of the American public.
"It's very easy for society to turn a blind eye because it's not their community," Schildkraut said.
After a decade, Zikuski is at a loss to explain how the American Civic Association seemingly became forgotten in the national conversation of mass shootings.
When looking at other shootings, back to Columbine, it's not as though Binghamton became eclipsed because of its size or even the number of victims.
"Do I agree with that? Yes, I do, it is sort of like the 'forgotten massacre,'" Zikuski said. "Not that we want to be known for this — this is one of the most tragic things that's happened in this community."
Zikuski said he hopes the fact that the American Civic Association involved an immigrant population didn't push it out of the national spotlight. But, he said, that's seemingly the most obvious explanation.
But perhaps more important than being ranked among the nation's mass shootings is being known for how the community healed, he said.
"I think this community took it hard, so I certainly don't think it was any less tragic because of who got shot," Zikuski said. "Nobody wants to be known for what happened here, but they don't want it forgotten. People want people to know this community pulled together."

NYT reporter reveals immigration sources

Texto completo: In a recent interview, New York Times immigration reporter Miriam Jordan revealed how she goes about putting together an immigration story.
Summarized, Jordan is heavily (if not exclusively) dependent on two sources: immigration lawyers and immigrants, often illegally present. Jordan also occasionally reaches out to advocacy groups and aid workers, but is cautious about citing federal immigration statistics.
Jordan called government data "untrustworthy" and not "necessarily credible." For her stories that require hard facts, Jordan also relies on the Pew Research Center and the Migration Policy Institute.
While these reputable think tanks are not advocacy groups per se, they promote higher immigration levels.
Conspicuously missing from Jordan's sources are immigration victims or any of the half dozen, well-established research organizations that promote less immigration. Jordan hasn't reported on immigration victims, including those who lost loved ones because of criminal aliens' murderous acts or whose jobs have been given to immigrants with employment-based visas. She hasn't covered aliens who present falsified Social Security numbers or who work for cash off the books.
Since she relies exclusively on sources that promote more immigration, Jordan cannot write a fair and balanced immigration story. Consider the lawyers she depends on for her material. No organization more richly profits from immigration increases than the American Immigration Lawyers Association. As evidence of how lucrative the immigration law profession is, AILA's membership has grown from 600 in 1975 to 15,000 today.
Imagine that a reporter gets an assignment to determine how often consumers should buy a new car. Then the reporter exclusively interviews National Automobile Dealers Association members. The high probability is that, according to the dealers, the prudent plan would be to purchase new every couple of years — more safety features have been added, the latest models yield better gas mileage, and better long-term financing is available to the buyer. Missing from the story is the buyer whose eight-year-old, regularly serviced car has logged 100,000 miles, and is still going strong. Just as automobile dealers' profit from more car sales, so too do lawyers gain from more immigration.
The 110-year-old, 10,000-plus member-strong Society of Professional Journalists posted in their Code of Ethics principles essential for public enlightenment. Among them are to seek truth and report it. As part of truth seeking, the SPJ deems that ethical journalism requires "a special obligation to serve as watchdogs over public affairs and government."
But when only the pro-immigration side is written, as Jordan and countless others do, then they have failed in their mission as watchdogs. The simple solution is to write a balanced story that gives an equal number of pro-immigration and immigration reduction sources.The lower immigration perspective is an important, statistically inarguable, but ignored, part of the mainstream media's bias. More than 1 million new lawful permanent work authorized immigrants arrive annually along with about 750,000 guest workers, allegedly but not always temporary.
Assuming the immigration status quo stays the same, the U.S. Census Bureau predicts that immigrants and their children will drive U.S. population to more than 400 million by 2060. These facts are crucially important for Americans to know and understand as they deliberate their individual opinions on more or less immigration.
Yet, Jordan and her peers deliberately withhold information that may lead their readers to conclude that immigration levels must be reduced for sustainability concerns if no others. The New York Times and other prominent daily newspapers largely refuse to publish information that reflects poorly on immigration, including unchallenged government data, hardly the definition of a watchdog.
With its huge reach — nearly 4 million subscribers — the New York Times has an obligation to tell the whole immigration story, not just the portion of it that matches a reporter's personal views and biases.

BACK STORY; Book's not closed on Russia; Mueller's investigation is complete, but the American public -- and members of Congress -- still have questions about election meddling

Texto completo: It might be hard to imagine, but despite dozens of criminal charges and wall-to-wall media coverage, the end of the Russia investigation has left a lot of unanswered questions.
Few of them were addressed in the bare-bones, four-page summary that Atty. Gen. William Barr sent to Congress on Sunday, and it's unclear how many details are in the full, confidential report that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had submitted to Barr two days earlier. The attorney general said Friday in a letter to Congress that the report is nearly 400 pages, not including appendixes.
Here's what we still don't know:

The professor
The first person to plead guilty in the nearly two-year investigation was George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy aide to President Trump's campaign. He admitted to lying about his conversations with Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor who allegedly told him that Russians were collecting dirt on Hillary Clinton and had thousands of emails. This conversation took place in April 2016, before Moscow started releasing hacked Democratic Party emails. Did Mifsud have inside information from the Kremlin? And did he share it as part of the Russian covert operation?
The Russian
Before Paul Manafort began leading Trump's campaign, he worked in Ukraine with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian whom prosecutors have repeatedly described as connected to Moscow's intelligence apparatus. However, they have not disclosed any evidence of these ties.
During the campaign, Manafort provided Kilimnik with polling data and later lied about it when asked by the special counsel's office, another red flag. Yet no charges were filed in connection with the decision to share the data. What was Manafort's goal? And did Kilimnik provide the information to anyone else?
The leaks
Roger Stone, a longtime political advisor to Trump, allegedly spent the campaign trying to learn more about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked Democratic Party emails. According to the indictment against him, Stone reached out to the organization's leader, Julian Assange, through intermediaries, but it's unclear whether he ever made contact. (Stone has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and is set to face trial this year.)
The indictment also said "a senior Trump campaign official was directed" to contact Stone about WikiLeaks after the first email release during the Democratic National Convention.
Who besides Trump was in position to direct a senior official to do something like that?
The meeting
Donald Trump Jr. didn't hesitate when he received an email from a British music publicist offering to arrange a meeting with a Russian lawyer who was said to be part of the Kremlin's effort to support his father's candidacy. Promised incriminating information on Clinton, Trump Jr. responded, "I love it." Also at the meeting, which took place in Trump Tower in June 2016, was Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and advisor; and Manafort, the campaign chairman.
However, no charges were filed in connection with the meeting, and participants have said no campaign assistance was provided. Did the Russian, Natalia Veselnitskaya, actually have a role in Moscow's covert campaign? Mueller has never said.
The lies
More than anything, Mueller uncovered an epidemic of lying among Trump's associates. Michael Flynn, the president's first national security advisor, lied about discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador during the transition period after the election. Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, lied about Trump Organization plans to build a luxury skyscraper in Moscow. And, as noted, Papadopoulos lied about his conversations with Mifsud, and Manafort about his dealings with Kilimnik.
Mueller apparently did not find evidence of a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia, yet why all the lying? Cohen testified that the president wanted him to mislead Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow proposal to avoid raising questions about Russian ties. Did others also lie to serve Trump?
The allegations
Since Trump took office, media reports have uncovered a series of his attempts, behind the scenes, to blunt or end the Russia probe.
James B. Comey testified to Congress that Trump asked him to go easy on Flynn when he was FBI director, in February 2017. The Washington Post reported that Trump asked intelligence officials to get Comey to back off the investigation in March 2017. Comey was then fired by Trump that May, leading to Mueller's appointment as special counsel.
The New York Times reported that Trump also wanted to fire Muellerin June 2017 but backed down when Don McGahn, then the White House counsel, refused to do so.
Did the special counsel's office substantiate any of these reports, or even learn more? And what might that mean for House Democrats' own investigations into whether the president abused his power?

Worst Job In Banking Opens Up. Who'll Bite?

Texto completo: Wanted: New chief executive to clean up radioactive mess. Hazmat suit not provided.
Wells Fargo is searching for a new leader after its chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, abruptly resigned on Thursday, having been hounded by politicians, regulators, customers and employees about the halting efforts to overhaul the scandal-tarred bank.
Wells Fargo, the country's fourth-largest bank, is starting its chief executive search from scratch. The chairwoman, Betsy Duke, said on Thursday that the board would try to recruit an executive from outside, someone without the baggage of being a Wells Fargo veteran.
Identifying a qualified candidate -- a person with extensive banking and management experience, the credibility to pacify regulators and the skill to shepherd a company with 260,000 restive employees -- will be a challenge. Persuading that person to take the job is likely to be even harder.
While Wells Fargo's finances are fundamentally sound, the bank faces a daunting list of problems: litigation, with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line; more than a dozen restrictions imposed by federal regulators; a largely demoralized work force that is chafing under the bank's leadership; and rigorous scrutiny of the bank's next leader from high-profile members of Congress.
"This is a really hard search," said Jeanne Branthover, a managing partner at the executive search firm DHR International. "Not everyone wants to lead something that could wreck their reputation."
Mr. Sloan resigned barely two weeks after he was lashed by congressional lawmakers about a New York Times article detailing the bank's persistent problems, including how many employees remain under pressure to hit sales targets. The board of directors has an executive-search committee that will run the recruitment process. The committee was holding its first meeting Friday. An outside adviser to the bank said the search was likely to take at least three months, perhaps much longer.
In the meantime, Wells Fargo will be run by C. Allen Parker, the general counsel. His job will largely entail trying to douse brush fires as they flare up. Most are products of a sales-obsessed Wells Fargo culture, which led employees to open fake accounts for customers, charge them unnecessary fees and sell them unwanted products.
"It's been like Whac-a-Mole at the bank," said Nancy Bush, a longtime industry analyst. "The minute one problem gets nailed down, another pops up. Whoever takes over has a whole lot of challenges they're going to have to get their hands around very fast."
One emerging problem is a federal class-action lawsuit in California that claims Wells Fargo needs to repay more fees that were charged to some customers who took out auto loans. The fees were for a product called "guaranteed auto protection," a type of insurance on their car purchases, which some customers have said they were forced to buy in order to get a loan.
Regulators have ordered Wells Fargo to return between $200 and $800 to thousands of borrowers in 11 states, but the California lawsuit claims that the bank should have to repay customers in the other 39 states, too. Many of the customers are low income and do not even know they are owed money, according to the lawsuit. By some estimates, Wells Fargo could still have to shell out more than $500 million in additional penalties and customer refunds.
The bank is fighting the lawsuit and denies having required any borrowers to buy the auto-protection policy before giving them auto loans.
United States regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, have 14 legal agreements restricting Wells Fargo's activities. The most stringent of those is from the Fed, which early last year took the unusual step of barring the bank from expanding until it improved its culture and strengthened its internal safeguards against fraud and other wrongdoing.
Mr. Sloan repeatedly proved too optimistic about his ability to get the Fed's order lifted -- a task that will now fall to his replacement.
The bank also remains under federal investigation, including for the sales practices in its wealth-management division. This month, Wells Fargo was one of numerous banks to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had tricked clients into buying more expensive investment products.
The bank and its leader are almost certain to remain popular political punching bags, especially as Democrats jostle for publicity in the run-up to the 2020 presidential primaries. When Mr. Sloan's resignation was announced late Thursday, prominent Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, pounced within minutes.
Representative Katie Porter, a Democrat from California and a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview on Thursday night that she planned to scrutinize Wells Fargo's choice to replace Mr. Sloan.
"What I want to hear is that they are using the fresh set of eyes to take an honest look at where Wells Fargo needs to change," Ms. Porter said. "It's not going to be quick to change things. I think we've seen that some of the pressure on employees, the nickel-and-diming of consumers, goes very deep."
Would anyone want a job like this?
The banking industry is brimming with self-confident executives. "It would be the capstone of someone's career -- and they can make a lot of money," said Bert Ely, a banking consultant.
Some of Wells Fargo's aggrieved customers have strong opinions on the bank's new leadership.
Shemeeka Beckham, 36, is part of the California lawsuit seeking repayment of the auto-protection fees. Six years ago, when she was buying a Dodge Charger with a loan from Wells Fargo, the bank pushed her to accept extra fees and products that raised her costs to $14,532 from $10,500.
"The bank was telling me I didn't have an option," said Ms. Beckham, who lives in Columbus, Ohio.
"I would advise the new C.E.O. -- he or she -- basically to just be more considerate of people."

Texto completo: La Cruz Roja anunció este viernes que distribuirá la ayuda humanitaria destinada para Venezuela, luego de que el mandatario Nicolás Maduro aceptara la intervención de este organismo internacional para aliviar la crisis humanitaria, que hasta ahora se ha negado a reconocer oficialmente.
Según reportó el diario The New York Times, Maduro autorizó a la Cruz Roja para que reparta toneladas de ayuda humanitaria que se destinarán a unos 650,000 venezolanos durante los próximos meses.
“Estimamos que en un plazo de aproximadamente 15 días estaremos preparados para brindar la ayuda”, dijo Francesco Rocca, presidente de la Federación Internacional de la Cruz Roja.
La Cruz Roja destacó que se trataba de “una labor técnica”, que no debía ser utilizada como munición política en la disputa por el poder entre el presidente interino Juan Guaidó y el mandatario Nicolás Maduro.
El enviado especial de Estados Unidos a Venezuela, Elliot Abrams, dijo a la agencia de noticias EFE que estaba contento de ceder a un “instrumento fiable” las toneladas de ayuda estadounidense que actualmente se encuentran almacenadas en Cúcuta, Colombia.
“Estaríamos felices de hacerlo, si hubiera un instrumento fiable para distribuir la ayuda, puede ser la Cruz Roja, la Iglesia, Cáritas, que le den la ayuda a la gente que la necesita sin ninguna base política, entonces estaríamos felices de hacerlo por ese canal”, dijo Abrams.
Anteriormente, Guaidó había intentado sin éxito introducir la ayuda a Venezuela, pero la oposición de los militares leales a Maduro y de grupos armados afines a su Gobierno imposibilitó su traslado.
“Estamos abiertos a todas las donaciones”, dijo Rocca. “Estamos dispuestos a negociar con cualquiera”, añadió.
Guaidó aplaudió de inmediato el anuncio de la Cruz Roja, en lo que pareció una inevitable politización de la medida.
“Esto es resultado de nuestra presión e insistencia. La lucha por el bien de todos da frutos”, dijo el presidente interino.
Guaidó y Maduro se disputan la presidencia del país desde que Guaidó se autoproclamó como el mandatario legítimo, según las disposiciones constitucionales, y más de 50 países lo reconocieron.
Luego Guaidó intentó llevar alimentos y medicinas para aliviar las necesidades de la población, sin embargo, el gobierno de Maduro negó que hubiera una crisis humanitaria en Venezuela.
Desde entonces Maduro ha recibido cargamentos con suministros provenientes de China y Rusia, mientras que Guaidó hizo lo mismo con ayuda enviada por Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea.

Texto completo: Arts Wrap
On their current tour, which comes to the First Interstate Center for the Arts on Saturday, a group of "deplorable" comedians hope to "Make America Laugh Again."
The "Deplorable" tour features performances from Michael Loftus (Comedy Central, HBO, Fox and Friends), Steve "Mudflap" McGrew (Comedy Central, SiriusXM), the Deplorable Choir and "Guitar Guy" Brain Haner (Showtime, Comedy Central, Jeff Dunham).
The show combines comedy and music into one politically charged variety show.
"The show enlightens, infuriates and entertains, but is never mean spirited," Loftus said in a press release. "It is a show to rally Trump supporters - sure - but it's also for intellectual conservatives and most of all, for middle class 'Deplorables' who are craving to once again have a voice in popular American culture."
If you go: 7:30 p.m. Saturday; First Interstate Center for the Arts, 334 W. Spokane Falls Blvd. $44-$129, available through TicketsWest.
UI picks 'There There'
for next Common Read
The University of Idaho has selected Tommy Orange's debut novel "There There" as its 2019-20 Common Read.
"There There" follows 12 characters in Oakland while examining what it means to be a Native American.
" 'There There' is a perfect complement to the first-year experience at the University of Idaho, where understanding one's place, identity and purpose is a crucial part of this transition," committee member Cindy Fuhrman, coordinator of the Indigenous Knowledge for Effective Education Program, said in a press release.
First-year students will read "There There" as part of their Integrated Seminar 101 course and in English 101 and 102.
Copies of the book are available through the VandalStore and BookPeople of Moscow.
Orange will speak in the International Ballroom of the Bruce M. Pitman Center on Nov. 5.
Orange, an enrolled member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma, was born and raised in Oakland and now lives in Angels Camp, California.
Orange recently graduated from the MFA program at the Institute of American Indian Arts. He is a 2014 MacDowell Fellow and a 2016 Writing by Writers Fellow.
"There There" has received a number of awards and accolades since its 2018 release, including the National Book Critics Circle Award's John Leonard Prize and being named one of the New York Times' favorite books of 2018.
In recent years, Common Read, now in its 12th year, has featured works including Anthony Doerr's "All the Light We Cannot See," Sy Montgomery's "The Soul of an Octopus," Carol Tavris' "Mistakes Were Made (but Not by Me)" and Tara Westover's "Educated: A Memoir."
Stevan Allred
"A fairy tale for adults, a bedtime story for grown-ups, a hopeful tale for our troubled times," so said Stevan Allred when discussing his novel "The Alehouse at the End of the World" with Book Trib in November.
"The Alehouse" tells the story of a fisherman who receives a letter about the death of his beloved. After reading this little, he sets off to find her.
During his journey, he is swallowed by a whale, which spits him up on the Isle of the Dead, which is ruled by a trio of giant bird gods.
Once there, the fisherman must negotiate with the leader, a narcissistic crow, to bring his beloved back from the dead.
" 'The Alehouse at the End of the World' is a story about a small band of heroes who stand up and stand together for the best in humanity, instead of succumbing to those who pander to the worst," Allred said.
If you go: 7 p.m. today; Auntie's Bookstore, 402 W. Main Ave.; Free.
'Blessings of Liberty'
In the 1940s, it was common practice for the parents of infants born with a disability to abandon their babies at an institution where those children were often cut off from their families and society.
But in the 1970s, a nationwide de-institutionalization movement swept the country and led to the creation of community-based alternatives for people with disabilities.
The film "Blessings of Liberty," screening today at the Kenworthy Performing Arts Centre, discusses Idaho's history of keeping people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in institutions.
The Idaho Council on Developmental Disabilities was inspired to make "Blessings of Liberty" after the 2017 Congressional attempts to block grant Medicaid, which would cut federal funding for home and community supports for people with disabilities.
As part of the screening, Moscow residents with disabilities will discuss how Medicaid helps them live full and meaningful lives.
If you go: 7 p.m. today; The Kenworthy Performing Arts Centre, 508 S. Main St., Moscow; Free; donations of nonperishable food items accepted.
'The Rehearsal'
All a young teacher wants to do is produce "Guys and Dolls."
Fairly straightforward, right?
Well, throw in a megalomaniacal stage manager, a cast with too few guys to be Guys, a lead performer who would rather be performing "Wicked" and a girl who is clinically incapable of taking directions (she has a doctor's note and everything) and rehearsals become a lot more dramatic.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The first things I noticed when I got to the St. Regis Hotel in Midtown Manhattan were the unmarked police cars out front. I wondered if Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had already gone inside.
That might make casually strolling into his $25,000-per-couple fund-raiser on the top floor a little more complicated.
The whole event had been a closely-guarded secret. The invitation included a date and a time but no location. To find out where it was happening, an R.S.V.P. was needed. Or, in my case, a helpful source.
I had made plans to show up at the fund-raiser a few weeks earlier when I was reporting on an article about what people often call "the circuit" in Albany: simultaneous fund-raisers that take place within walking distance of the State Capitol when the Legislature is in session.
During that reporting, I learned that Mr. Cuomo would be having a fund-raiser in New York City on March 14. The timing struck me: The governor and state lawmakers would be in the midst of deciding the state budget, due on April 1. At the very least, it seemed like a convenient time to ask people for political contributions.
[Read: A Secretive Dinner Where $25,000 Buys Access to Cuomo (and Filet Mignon)]
I guessed that some of those who would be donating to Mr. Cuomo -- like those who go on the circuit in Albany -- would have a strong financial stake in various elements of the budget. I wanted to know who would be there.
I began to ask around to find the address and eventually learned that the somewhat cloak-and-dagger affair would be held in a space on the 20th floor of the St. Regis, a luxury hotel where the cheapest rooms run about $1,000.
Cocktails were at 6 p.m., dinner 30 minutes later. The governor would be making a speech.
I knew that I would not be able to sit for dinner without a ticket, but hoped that I could blend in with the crowd for cocktails. So the evening of the event, March 14, I wore a suit, boarded the E train and set off.
Naturally, the subway was delayed.
When I got to the hotel, I walked straight inside, asked for The Roof -- which is actually an indoor ballroom-style space -- and took the elevator up with a couple of French tourists.
Once on the 20th floor, I immediately ran into a lobbyist I knew, who seemed surprised to see me. Because of the train delay, I arrived at about 6:15 p.m. and many of the guests had already entered. There was no way to blend in with the crowd because there was no crowd; just a phalanx of young staff at a check-in table.
I had no choice but to introduce myself.
"Hi, I'm David Goodman with The New York Times. Can I go inside?"
No way, one man said. News media not allowed.
I asked to speak to a press person, but none was available. I asked the staffers who they were with and they said "the campaign." I asked for what Mr. Cuomo was campaigning. President in 2020? Re-election in 2022?
They could not say.
Before I turned to go, I noticed the table in front of me had the name tags of more than 30 invited guests. I took out my phone and snapped a picture, thinking I would be told to stop. No one said anything. I took two more and then left.
After that, I posted on Twitter about the event but did not let on that I had names of some of the guests.
The list proved to be a gold mine. I began looking into each name.
Some I recognized, like John Catsimatidis, the politically-involved supermarket magnate. Others were unfamiliar. I began with simple web searches to find out who they might be. Then I called them and asked if they had attended. If they did, I got them to describe the scene as they remembered it. A few were invited but said they did not attend.
There were executives whose companies are right now lobbying the state. There were union heads with ongoing state business. Joining them at the fund-raiser was the state budget director, who, Mr. Cuomo's staff said, happened to be in New York City that day.
For most who were there, the fund-raiser was an unremarkable event.
But for me, its very banality for those involved was the reason to show readers, who might never attend such an event, what it entails. This sort of thing, perfectly legal but held in secret, is commonplace in the American political system -- one big-dollar fund-raiser among many.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The still-secret report on Russian interference in the 2016 election submitted last week by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was more than 300 pages long, the Justice Department acknowledged on Thursday.
Mr. Barr wrote to Congress on Sunday offering what he called the "principal conclusions" of the report -- including that Mr. Mueller had not found that the Trump campaign had taken part in a conspiracy to undermine the election. But he had notably declined to publicly disclose its length.
The total of 300-plus pages suggests that Mr. Mueller went well beyond the kind of bare-bones summary required by the Justice Department regulation governing his appointment and detailed his conclusions at length. And it raises questions about what Mr. Barr might have left out of the four dense pages he sent to Congress.
Answering those questions is likely to prove difficult for lawmakers and the public. Mr. Barr has indicated to two congressional chairmen that it will most likely take weeks to redact the report for classified and grand jury information the department deems unfit for public consumption.
But Justice Department officials, including some from the attorney general's office, could examine the report before sending any documents to Congress for possible material the president could claim as privileged, according to a department official.
The practice is not unusual, but it would most likely create another tranche of material from Mr. Mueller's investigation to be withheld from Congress and kick off a fight between lawmakers and the administration that would further delay a resolution. No plans have been made for a review, the official said, and it was not clear whether Mr. Barr would be personally involved.
If the Justice Department were to deem certain aspects of Mr. Mueller's report to be subject to executive privilege, Democrats in Congress would almost certainly contest the assertion and force Mr. Trump to actually claim the privilege -- and risk a court challenge -- or not. Law enforcement officials had no plans to show White House officials the report before it was sent to Congress, the Justice Department official said.
Democrats, who like all other lawmakers have not seen the report, have already all but accused Mr. Barr of covering up damaging information it contains. They have specifically focused on an apparent difference between the views of Mr. Barr and Mr. Mueller on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. Democrats have demanded that the attorney general make the full report and evidence public.
"For Mr. Barr to quickly issue a four-page report in his attempt to try to exonerate Mr. Trump, and now to delay the release of an over 300-page report written by Mueller so the American people and we senators and congressmen can see what was written, has too much of the odor of political expediency to help the man who appointed him, President Trump," Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a speech on the chamber floor.
Republicans have adopted a more trusting stance of Mr. Barr, indicating that they believe he will make appropriate judgments about what should and should not be shared.
The new ballpark page length came about a week after a senior Justice Department official told reporters that the report was "comprehensive."
Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, added the description "very substantial" after talking to Mr. Barr on Wednesday, although neither he nor any other member of Congress has seen the report and he declined to give a page count. Andrew Napolitano, a legal analyst for Fox News and a favorite of Mr. Trump, caused a stir on Wednesday when he said multiple times on the air that the report was 700 pages.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, confirmed the length of the document after The New York Times reported it, citing American officials who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss details of the report.
Mr. Barr had told Mr. Nadler on their Wednesday call that the report was more than 300 pages long, Ms. Kupec said.
Other blockbuster government reports in recent decades have been lengthy. At 445 pages, the independent counsel Ken Starr's report on President Bill Clinton had to be trucked to Capitol Hill in September 1998.
The 9/11 commission report ran 567 pages with notes on the circumstances and fallout of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Even the Justice Department inspector general seems to have outwritten Mr. Mueller of late. Michael E. Horowitz released a scathing report last summer on the F.B.I.'s handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state that preoccupied Congress for weeks.
Mr. Horowitz's report was 568 pages.
By contrast, the Watergate "road map" sent to Congress by the grand jury investigating President Richard M. Nixon and his associates was only 62 pages. Sent to lawmakers in 1974, the court report was not unsealed by a federal judge and made public until last year.
Mr. Mueller probably collected and generated hundreds of thousands if not millions of pages of paper during his investigation. Congress has made clear it would eventually like access to all of them, but the Justice Department could have good reason to block the release of some, leaving it once again to the courts to determine who sees what.
Members of Mr. Barr's and Mr. Mueller's teams are currently reviewing the full report to redact information that they do not believe should be made public for intelligence or other reasons. Mr. Barr has told lawmakers in recent days that it will take weeks to make more of Mr. Mueller's findings public.

Texto completo: In every session of the U.S. Congress during his tenure, John Conyers (D-Mich.) introduced a bill to study and develop reparation proposals. Now Rashida Tlaib holds Conyers' seat from Detroit, but HR40 is once again before the House. With the Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, and with liberals and people of color so dominant, a bill might be passed to establish the commission to study the issue. However, there is no assurance that such a measure will survive in the Senate. Still many believe that a resolution of the reparations issue would help to resolve the nation's racial conflict.
Those expecting reparations to uplift the spirit and creativity of African Americans are probably underestimating the cumulative damage to the human psyche from sustained oppression. In a recent commentary in the New York Times, Paul Krugman claimed that the East Germans have not yet recovered from the Communist oppression. The Russians gained control of East Germany in 1945 and they built the Berlin Wall to exclude contact with the West. The wall did not fall until Nov. 9,1989, only 44 years later.
According to Krugman, a recognized economist, West Germany has spent $1.7 trillion in the 29.5 years since the fall of the wall to revive East German productivity. That amounts to about $100,000 per resident, yet the economy still lags. National leaders with substantial resources have not solved the problem in Germany in 30 years. Black leaders should have little expectation for benefits that could result from reparations, even if adequate funds were made available. Blacks have suffered slavery, abuse and racial discrimination in the U.S. for more than two centuries. The impact on black culture has been extensive.
"I bet those folks think it's unfair for a college to have a diverse student body."

Making Rondo documentary ignites a new generation

Texto completo: Margaret Lovejoy was a little girl growing up in the Rondo neighborhood of St. Paul when bulldozers and cranes came to make way for highway I-94 in the mid-1950s. Last week, Lovejoy came up with a new phrase for what happens when the powers-that-be make way for progress, people be damned.
“Rondo should become a national experience: ‘Rondo-nizing.’ We’ll start a new word here,” said Lovejoy, sitting in a conference room at the High School For Recording Arts in St. Paul with a few of the students and advisers who produced the new documentary “Rondo: Beyond the Pavement.” “All communities across the United States have gone through this Rondo aspect, so hopefully what this [documentary] will do — especially with this video going out to high schools — high schoolers will know that change has to happen, and they’ll be the impetus for change.”
What’s the latest manifestation of Rondo-nizing? All concerned point to Allianz Field and concerns about rising rents, affordability, rising property values, the effect of the Green Line, and the gentrification of the Hamline-Midway neighborhood.
“With the soccer stadium, I mean, do they think they’re slick with that?” said student Morgan Welch. “They’re just trying to run everybody out. These buildings are all hidden behind construction, and there’s signs that say, ‘We’re still open for business, please come.’ That’s horrible that they have to spend extra money just to make themselves seen.”
“What is happening is white eyes now see that community as a good place to be,” said Lovejoy, who grew up in and lives in the Rondo neighborhood. “You can buy a house for very little, and fix it up, and if you want to flip it, you can. We don’t want this whole ‘buy out’ of our properties. If you’re a moderately incomed family, you can’t afford to live in Rondo. You can’t afford the property, and that’s not right. If I were to sell my house now, I couldn’t move back into Rondo because I couldn’t afford it.”
“I went into Sally [Beauty Supply in the Midway neighborhood] and the owner was crying because her business has gone down and I bought something extra because I felt bad,” said student Jasmine McBride. “Why should people see this film? The idea of progress, right? The people putting the stadium in are for progress, but progress for who?”
Those questions are why some of the HSRA students are talking about making a new documentary about the gentrification of the neighborhood that’s going on now. Lessons that speak to the here-and-now came from their experience of making “Rondo: Beyond the Pavement,” which has been making the festival circuit and which screens Friday (7 p.m.) and Saturday (2 p.m. and 7 p.m.) at The Family Place, 244 10th Street East in St. Paul.
“My main take-away from making this documentary is that there is no justice, and if you want justice it’s one of those things that you’ve just got to get for yourself in this type of world,” said student Angelo Bush.
New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow regularly tweets out a quote by James Baldwin, and it can’t be re-quoted enough, as it has everything to do with why the story of the highway 94 corridor the treatment of the Rondo community remains relevant: “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.”
Baldwin wrote that in 1961, five years after city and state planners plowed over the homes of 600 African-American families to make way for the highway. The Rondo story is an oft-told one, and it will continue to be told and have new resonance in these times of reparations and renamings. For many who know the history, the highway’s existence in the Rondo neighborhood itself is a daily reminder of Minnesota’s institutional racism, and thus a source of Baldwin’s and a people’s “rage.”
“I want people to see this video and get fired up, because that’s what it did to me. It fired me up,” said student Aubrianna Jackson. “There’s a lot of things that happen that people don’t know about. There’s a specific pyramid of power in each state, in each city, any little area that needs to be controlled. I lived in Frogtown, but I never knew about Rondo, and that just goes to say that these types of things are kept in a particular area, and the people who are in charge are in on these types of conversations, and you literally have to dig and ask questions in order to find these answers to why the 94 highway was actually placed there.
“Because as everyday people, we’re just led to believe that it was placed there for convenience, and that wasn’t the case, and the whole idea of this film was to bring that to light — that it wasn’t just for convenience; it was because there was a population of African-American people and a community that was targeted, and that’s why they put it there. Because to them, it was like, this is sparing the people who have more money. It’s all about money.”
Fitting that “Beyond the Pavement” comes from the High School of Recording Arts, many of whose students identify as homeless.
“Teaching here at this high school, I see the effects of systemic racism every day,” said Scott Herold, founder of Rock The Cause Records and a teacher of media and business at HSRA. “I see the effects of what has happened to people of color. I see what has happened to people who have been born into a situation where they are not on equal footing with others, and for our young people to come to this school every day and overcome the incredible trauma that they’ve had to overcome in their lives and work on a film like this and get paid for it and tell this story and be able to transform this into something that can hopefully heal a community … it’s powerful. People should see this.”
“What I got from [making the documentary] was our responsibility as the youth to make things change, as it was for our elders and they did what they did, but we have to pick up the baton,” said student Jasmine McBride. “That’s the biggest thing I’ve taken away from it. My parents grew up in the Rondo community and still live there, and I grew up in the Rondo community. That area now, somebody just posted on Facebook, ‘Selby looks like a mini Grand [Avenue],’ because it’s literally changing and they’re taking everything all over again.
“I’m not saying that progress and new developments aren’t good, but the problem is still that we don’t own any of that. Still, our community is being taken and as the youth and as the next generation … . They’re going to continue to keep taking our land, taking our communities, splitting and dividing our communities even more if we don’t take action. And that means getting into positions, getting into politics, getting into real estate — we have to strategically start taking over.
“We have to start getting into those positions that matter. That’s one of the reasons why I think it’s a big deal that Melvin Carter is mayor: He’s in a position where he as a person of color can actually call shots. We can protest, we can march all we want to, but if we don’t start actually getting in the positions to take back our community, they’re going to continue to take it.”

Texto completo: After two years of intense anticipation and speculation, the findings of the Mueller Report are finally in: President Trump did not collude with the Russians.
The headline in the New York Times on Monday, March 25 read, “Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy,” the Washington Post declared, “Mueller finds no conspiracy,” and the Wall Street Journal printed, “Mueller finds no Trump collusion.”
In spite of all of that, on Tuesday, March 26, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying, “Undoubtedly, there is collusion…We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues.”
In another interview with “ABC This Week,” Schiff said that there is “still significant evidence of collusion” and that “there’s a difference between compelling evidence of collusion and whether the special counsel concludes that he can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the criminal charge of conspiracy.”
Okay, then.
Either they don’t deliver the papers to Burbank, or Schiff is prepared to accept the Mueller Report the same way he accepted the results of the 2016 presidential election.
Not at all.
Schiff is like one of those Japanese soldier hold-outs they found on a Pacific island 30 years after World War II ended, still carrying on the fight. Long after Trump and Melania and Ivanka are dead and buried, Schiff will be demanding that President Barron Trump answer a few more questions about the Steele dossier.
At first glance it’s easy to assume that Schiff is pretty dense, and think “how did in the world did he even get on the Intelligence Committee in the first place? Did his parents pay someone a half-million dollar bribe?”
But don’t make the mistake of thinking that he’s stupid.
On the contrary, Schiff is a malicious grifter who has recklessly peddled this provably false conspiracy theory for years, and can’t muster up the courage to admit that he’s wrong.
Schiff’s incessant collusion theories have gotten him so much coverage on cable news he’s been on MSNBC more often than the inmates on “Lockup.”
Here’s just a sampling of some of his greatest hits…
In March of 2017, Schiff said on Meet the Press that there was “circumstantial evidence of collusion” and “direct evidence… of deception.”
Also in March, Schiff told MSNBC there was “more than circumstantial evidence” — and claimed that had seen it.
On December 14, 2017, Schiff told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, “Well, look, there’s clear evidence of an attempt to collude.”
On March 1, 2018, Megan McCain of ABC’s “The View” asked Schiff, “Last March you said you have more than circumstantial evidence of treasonous collusion with Russia. What specifically were you referring to? And please be specific because if it’s true I do believe Americans have the right to know a year later what that is.”
In response, Schiff gave a rambling answer that referenced George Papadapolous, Donald Trump Jr., and a meeting at Trump Tower.
When he was finished, McCain said, “I just think if Mueller doesn’t end up charging him, it just looks like a lot of smoke and mirrors.”
On May 27, 2018 he told “ABC This Week,” that of the Russia investigation, “I think, of a size and scope possibly beyond Watergate.”
On August 5, 2018 he told “CBS This Morning,” “I think there’s plenty of evidence of collusion.”
For two years, Schiff would tell anyone who would listen that President Trump colluded with the Russians, and now we know for a fact, that he was full of it the whole time.
A charlatan like this doesn’t belong anywhere near the Intelligence Committee, let alone as its chairman.
For heaven’s sake, Megan McCain made him look like a fool on The View. That alone should get him kicked off the Intelligence Committee.
At this point, I think it’s obvious that a con artist like Congressman Schiff doesn’t have the character to apologize to President Trump or to the American people; so it’s up to his colleagues to remove him as chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays at 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Texto completo: Emma Coronel , esposa de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , sigue causando curiosidad entre periodistas, autoridades y analistas de los cárteles en México, ya que hasta ahora es la única esposa de un alto líder del narco mexicano que ha sobresalido por su belleza, estilo y una personalidad fuerte, que deja incluso ver poco de lo que realmente piensa o siente.
Varios perfiles hechos en diarios como el New York Times, L.A. Times, El País, Rolling Stone, incluso en este periódico, revelan sólo una parte de lo que Coronel quiso mostrar en público. Su primera entrevista a un medio de alta cobertura como Telemundo fue retomada por periodicos y televisoras en inglés y español en Estados Unidos. Había nacido formalmente la “Kardashian de Sinaloa” .
Entre los aspectos que sorprendieron de la exreina de belleza fue su fortaleza para acudir a prácticamente a todo el juicio en la Corte de Brooklyn, siempre con una sonrisa para quienes se sentaban alrededor de ella, pero con un rostro serio, casi inmutable frente las fuertes narraciones de asesinatos y trasiego de droga que testigos relataban.
“Creo que Emma y El Chapo hicieron algún show para los medios (durante el juicio) “, dice Anabel Hernández , periodista mexicana autora del libro Narcoland: Los narcotraficantes mexicanos y sus padrinos. “Pero Emma sabe perfectamente cómo es ‘El Chapo'” .
La experta en narcotrafico mexicano dijo a Rolling Stone que la razón de que Coronel no se impresionara con algunos testimonios, incluso el Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López, la “Chapodiputada” –una de las examantes de su esposo– es que ella sabía todo con antelación.
“Estoy segura de que el testimonio para ella no fue una sorpresa” , consideró.
Coronel también desató polémica al afirmar que admiraba y amaba a su esposo, a pesar de todos los crímenes de los que se le acusa.
“No conozco a mi esposo como la persona que están tratando de mostrar” , dijo Coronel al Times. “Lo admiro como el ser humano que conocí y con el que me casé”.
La esposa del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa –que nació en los Estados Unidos– también asombró por el amor hacia sus gemelas de 7 años de edad, a quienes llevó en tres ocasiones al juicio, pero después decidió no hacerlo más.
“Ella realmente se preocupa por sus hijas. Por los comentarios que hace, creo que realmente se preocupa por ellas”, dice Hernández.
El día en que el exsocio de Guzmán Loera, Dámaso López Núñez, alias “El Lic” , afirmó que Coronel ayudó a la segunda fuga de su esposo, ella ni se inmutó. Volvió a sorprender, como cuando fue detenida en Mazatlán con sus hijas y su marido. Historia relatada a detalla por un exagente de la DEA.
Hernández cree que esa ocasión ella quería enviar el mensaje de que estaba “en peligro”, por eso se le vio vulnerable.
“El mensaje fue que su vida estaba en peligro” , dice Hernández. “Si ella estaba siendo sincera o no, no lo sé… solo puedo decirte, para mí como periodista, ese era el mensaje que quería enviar”.
Es incierto si hay o no amor en entre Guzmán Loera y Coronel, pero él confía mucho en ella y ella muestra confianza en él.
“Lo que he aprendido a lo largo de todo este tiempo, en estos años, en los contactos con Emma y familiares de ‘El Chapo’, es que él tiene mucha confianza en ella. Él realmente confía en ella “, dice Hernández. “Y ella es la única esposa, la única mujer (en su vida) que quiere hablar de él, que trata de defenderlo”.

1984: 2 Dubuque-based paintings help fuel Grant Wood's critical resurgence

Texto completo: BY ERIK HOGSTROM

Two paintings owned by Carnegie-Stout Public Library in Dubuque were among the works featured in a 1984 exhibit that helped resurrect the reputation of Iowa artist Grant Wood.
"Appraisal" and "Victorian Survival," painted in 1931 and purchased a few years later, were included in the show at the Art Institute of Chicago. The exhibit was the first of Wood's works at a major museum since 1942 and came during a reassessment of the Anamosa, Iowa, native's legacy.
Here is how the Telegraph Herald reported on the paintings and the exhibit in its March 25, 1984, edition.
GRANT WOOD: AFTER DECADES OF RIDICULE, HE FINALLY RECEIVES RESPECT
In "Death on the Ridge Road," Grant Wood poised a low-slung sedan near the top of a hill. The sedan, in the left lane, has just passed a pokey Ford. But a blood-red truck looms in the storm clouds atop the hill, about to deliver tragedy.
That painting might have been a map of Grant Wood's career. When the Iowa artist painted it in 1935, Wood was zooming toward the top of the artistic world, fueled by the phenomenal success of his "American Gothic."
The shy farm boy from Anamosa was the talk of the big city, where his fans included Cole Porter and Edward G. Robinson. He had been hailed by Time magazine as the "chief philosopher" of a new school of American regionalist painting, the wave of the future.
Seven years later, Grant Wood was dead, his reputation a wreck. Critics panned a memorial show of his works at the Art Institute of Chicago. Some of Wood's earliest admirers now branded him "small-souled," "crypto-fascist," "obsolete." By the time liver cancer claimed Grant Wood in 1942, his career was already dead. He was 50.
By 1974, the chief art critic of the New York Times proclaimed Grant Wood and his works "a corpse," which he saw "no need to disinter."
And yet, as anyone from Wood's beloved eastern Iowa could have told those critics, after every valley comes another hill.
Respect for the art of Grant Wood is on the rise. The Art Institute of Chicago is putting on the first major museum show of Wood's works since 1942.
Two paintings from Dubuque - "Appraisal" and "Victorian Survival" - are on loan to the Art Institute of Chicago show from Carnegie-Stout Public Library in Dubuque.
Why has Wood rebounded from obscurity? Timothy Lennon, conservator of paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago, credits "sufficient distance. The half-century since that period gives us the proper historical perspective."
Peter Schjeldahl, art critic for Vanity Fair magazine, ties the renaissance of Wood's "cracker barrel naturalism" to the conservative mood of the country under President Ronald Reagan.
Back home in Iowa, Wood's reputation never went downhill in the first place. Cedar Rapids boasts a Grant Wood School, and Stone City, where Wood founded a short-lived art colony, hosts an annual festival in his name.

Colin McEnroe: The Force remains strong in Blumenthal

Texto completo: Dear President Trump.
Let me tell you two stories from the year 2000.
First: At the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, I found myself among a group of Connecticut delegates exiting a very feisty and enjoyable party. I’m going guess it was 3:30 a.m. Perhaps uncharacteristically, I was the least inebriated person in a group of 30 or so.
Sign up to get Colin’s newsletter delivered to your inbox, for free.
I located some convention staffers and told them I needed a bus. They brought me one. I put all of the partiers on the bus and we returned to the hotel that housed the Connecticut delegation. By now, let us say that it was perhaps 4:30 a.m. I led them to an elevator and pressed “up.” The doors opened.
There stood Richard Blumenthal. In his jogging attire.

You don’t know what kind of force you’re dealing with, Mr. President.
You have weaknesses. Cheeseburgers. Strippers. Chocolate cake. Strippers jumping out of chocolate cakes and brandishing cheeseburgers.
Richard Blumenthal is like the anti-matter version of these things.
Second story: During that same campaign I befriended Blumenthal’s Republican opponent for attorney general, one Santa Mendoza.
(Sidebar: the Fundamental Orders were adopted by the Colony of Connecticut in 1639 and represent one of the first — if not THE first — written constitutions in the modern sense of the term. The Orders specifically mention Richard Blumenthal and that he will be attorney general for a really long period. This is what I mean, Mr. President. Blumenthal is not even restrained by the space-time continuum.)
Back to Mendoza. She was a sharp, funny, telegenic, Latina candidate at a time when the national Republican party was eagerly courting non-white votes. In Connecticut, the party was led by John Rowland and his cronies, who never knew what to make of Mendoza because she did not resemble any character in “Animal House,” which was pretty much their Rosetta Stone for understanding everything.
On Election Day, Mendoza was poll-standing in New Haven. A group of Latino voters approached her and thanked her profusely for being such a stellar embodiment of their politically underrepresented minority. They told her she had made them proud. They thanked her some more.
“Thank you,” Mendoza replied. “And thank you for your vote.”
“Oh,” they said, “we’re voting for Blumenthal!”
This is what I’m talking about, Mr. President. Richard Blumenthal is a force that bypasses normal human instincts.
When you attack Richard Blumenthal, Mr. President, you often seem to think you can gain the upper hand by bringing up his past statements that made it sound like he served in Vietnam, when in fact he was a stateside Marine reservist.
That story was splashed all over the front page of The New York Times in the heat of his 2010 Senate campaign against an opponent with nearly unlimited wrestling-derived financial resources.
Do you know what happened? He won the election by a 55-43 margin. Something that could have destroyed a mortal, human candidate gave him the hiccups for two weeks.
So now, you have eked out a little breathing room between yourself and the pursuing hounds, Mr. President, and you seem to think it’s payback time. The people who supported the special counsel investigation must suffer. Your Sarah Sanders wants the press and offending politicians held “accountable.” Your re-election campaign wants people like Blumenthal kept off the airwaves as much as possible.
You think you can drive the rebel Blumenthal up into the hills to crouch amid the brush and live on rainwater and tree frogs? No, it is you who will wind up there, sir, and the tree frogs will not taste like cheeseburgers.
When Obi-Wan said to Vader, “If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,” do you know what the actor Alec Guinness studied to prepare for the line? Old Blumenthal tapes! You can hear the flatness, the monotone in his delivery. He’s wearing jogging clothes under those Jedi robes! Don’t you get it, Mr. President? No you don’t.
I don’t say that Blumenthal has no weaknesses. Of course he does. We know what they are. He likes to look into cameras pointed at him. He likes to speak into microphones. He likes to talk to humans who are writing his words down in rectangular notebooks. He can be roused at 4 a.m. from a deep slumber and immediately start doing these things, unless he’s already up anyway doing some weird abdominal contractions.
Wait. A noise. Something is in my inbox! It’s a press release from Blumenthal, Mr. President, questioning your administration’s handling of the Boeing 737 issue. It mentions “lapses in safety oversight” and leaving “the fox to guard the henhouse.”
And now my Twitter is tweeting. It’s him again! “The fish rots from the head: the President himself continues to hold an ownership stake in the Trump Organization even as he makes policy decisions that could impact & prioritize its bottom line,” he tweets.
You cannot stop him. The Force is too strong.
And, Mr. President, they say there is another. One in whom the Force may be even stronger, if he can learn to control it.
They call this one Tong.

Texto completo: If you need proof that women directors are under-represented in Hollywood, consider that females only helmed eight percent of 2018's 250 top-grossing films.
It was even worse during Hollywood's Golden Age when, essentially, only two women got a chance to step behind the camera: Dorothy Arzner and Ida Lupino.
While Arzner worked predominantly with big stars on such studio features as "Christopher Strong," "Craig's Wife" and "Dance, Girl, Dance," Lupino preferred to direct tougher, grittier, independently financed films.
A great way to celebrate Lupino's 100th birthday is to check out a beautifully restored edition of her best film, "The Hitch-Hiker," which is unreeling on Sunday at 1:30 p.m. at the Colonial Theatre in Phoenixville. Tickets are $7.
Loosely inspired by the true-life murder spree of a man named Billy Cook, "The Hitch-Hiker" is the story of two friends (Edmund O'Brien, Frank Lovejoy) on a camping trip who are held at gunpoint by a homicidal drifter (William Talman).
Desperate to escape, Talman forces the men to take him on a nightmarish joyride across the Mexican desert.
Cook had a deformed right eye, and Talman was given a prosthetic device to mimic Cook's condition. Beautifully realized by the movie's make-up artists, the defect helps Talman give his character a sinister edge, so that even when he's sleeping, his hostages can't tell if he's awake or dozing off.
While some of the violence might seem tame today, in 1953, when the film was released, most moviemakers shied away from presenting such brutality. But Lupino, working independently with her ex-husband/producer Collier Young, was fearless. She boldly gave the film an almost documentary-like sense of reality.
No less an expert on screen violence than Martin Scorsese recently hailed Lupino's five directorial efforts as "a singular achievement in American cinema," while The New York Times' J. Hoberman called Lupino "a true maverick ... She made movies with the same steely determination and emotional sensitivity that characterized her work as an actor."
Part of what makes "The Hitch-Hiker" so impressive is how Lupino uses space. Even though much of the action takes place in a car, the film never grows static. In fact, Lupino, who was also a well-known actress, and who passed away in 1995, masterfully utilizes the automobile's tight quarters to communicate a sense of claustrophobia and escalating tension.
Lupino is also a wiz at close-ups. As critic David Greven pointed out, the filmmakers' intense visual scrutiny of the three very different men at the center of the film "becomes a meditation on the varieties of the male face."

New to Blu-ray: If you want to see exactly when Freedom High School grad Dwayne Johnson came into his own as an actor, check out "The Rundown" (2003, Mill Creek, PG-13, $10), an effortlessly entertaining action flick about a bounty hunter who is hired to retrieve his boss's son (Seann William Scott) from the jungles of Brazil.
Now available in a nifty Blu-ray and DVD package, the film is heaps of fun, thanks to Johnson's star turn.

Texto completo: A few weeks ago, knowing the end wasn't far off, James A. Winn was writing his memoirs, editing a flute-piano duet he had recorded a few months earlier, and coping with the end stage of pancreatic cancer, whose grim, initial prognosis he had far outlived to give his life an often joyous coda.
His thoughts also turned to what inevitably lay ahead as met with an Episcopal priest to plan a memorial service. “I've been trying to confront my fears and sorrows," he wrote to friends on his caringbridge.org journal.
To that end, as a longtime English professor, he quoted from a famous early-1600s sonnet by John Donne:
Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
Dr. Winn, who wove together a career as an English professor with decades of performances and recordings as an accomplished flutist, died in his Brattleboro, Vt., home Thursday. He was 71 and had retired in 2017 from Boston University, after teaching through the early months of his diagnosis.
“His life was the life of one who was passionate about ideas and about beauty in all of its manifestations — and that was quite infectious," said Linda Gregerson, a poet and a professor of English and creative writing at the University of Michigan, where he taught before joining BU's faculty in 1998. “He was also, as a colleague, quite an inspiration and a little bit daunting."
Dr. Winn could read German, Greek, French, and Latin. He could write poetry, along with interpreting it in books and journal articles. A scholar of 18th century British literature, he was equally at ease praising and illuminating the lyrics of the Beatles and Bruce Springsteen.
“He could recite an uncanny amount of poetry. Give him a line of Shakespeare and he'd be off," said his daughter, Ellen, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y. “Somebody called him a flypaper brain. He didn't forget. He had a big, big brain and a big, big heart."
Globe reviewer Robert Taylor said Dr. Winn had written a “first-rate biography" when he published “John Dryden and his World" in 1987.
A New York Times reviewer was even more effusive about the way Dr. Winn examined the 17th century poet's life. The book was “the most important biography of Dryden ever written," Richard Bernstein wrote.
“Dryden's great lesson is that a writer can be simultaneously engaged in the most public issues — in his case, politics and religion and their intertwining — and be engaged at the highest level of his craft," Dr. Winn told Bernstein then. “The lesson is to use poetry to make precise, targeted, moral statements about our world."
Dr. Winn did that himself in his 2008 book “The Poetry of War," which looked at how poets had viewed wars from ancient Greece to Afghanistan and Iraq.
Poetry, he wrote, is necessary “to counter the mindless simplifications of war propaganda."
Throughout history, “soldiers trusted poets to make their deeds immortal, and poets embraced warfare as a grand challenge," he added, and in turn poets used “the full range of poetry's powers to express the full range of our contradictory responses to war."
Born in Charlotte, N.C., in 1947, James Anderson Winn was the second of four children. His father, the Rev. Albert Curry Winn, was a Presbyterian minister who formerly served as president of Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. His mother, Grace Neely Walker Winn, worked in early childhood education and was “a passionate lifelong worker for peace," her son would later write.
Dr. Winn grew up mostly in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Louisville, Ky., a formative experience.
“People in the South have a much more tragic and complex sense of history than, say, my students here in the Midwest," he told the Times when he was teaching at the University of Michigan. “We grew up with a very large sense of the past."
Early on, he began playing the flute and also could sing and play guitar and piano. At Princeton University, from which he graduated in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in English, he performed with the orchestra and sang with the Footnotes a cappella group.
He was then drafted into the Army, serving as principal flutist in the 50th Army Band.
For his doctorate, Dr. Winn attended Yale University, graduating in 1974. He went on to teach at Yale for several years before joining Michigan's faculty in 1983.
He was founding director of the Institute for the Humanities at Michigan, where he held dual appointments as a professor of English and of music. At BU, he had chaired the English department and directed the Center for the Humanities.
Throughout, he wrote books about literature and about music, and he recorded several CDs as a flutist — achieving more in two separate fields than many academics do in one.
“I don't know anybody else like him. He became a unique figure in the areas he represented," said Robert Freeman, who most recently had been dean of fine arts at the University of Texas Austin and before that had been president of New England Conservatory and director of the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester in New York.
“He lived life fully and he put an enormous amount of energy into it," Freeman added.
Dr. Winn formerly was married to Kathe Fox, with whom he had two children who, he later wrote, were “endless sources of joy and wonder." In 2009, he married Lucy Chapman, a violinist who has chaired the chamber music faculty and the strings studio faculty at New England Conservatory.
“They traveled and cooked and gardened and did all manner of things together," his daughter Ellen said, adding that Dr. Winn was “an incredibly good cook and a very involved father" — someone who liked hosting a crowd of 25 at Thanksgiving.
As a professor, Dr. Winn “was both a wonderful teacher and an incredible mentor," said Julie Peters, a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University who formerly was his student at Yale.
In an entry on his CaringBridge journal, she wrote that he was “also a person of such unbridled enthusiasm for the pleasures and possibilities of life, a person who taught that it might sometimes be better to embrace a knowing naiveté over a jaded worldliness, and that one could be ironic without a hint of cynicism."
In addition to his wife, Lucy, and daughter, Ellen, Dr. Winn leaves his son, Philip of Brooklyn, N.Y., and four grandchildren, all of whom were born since his diagnosis. “He was always happy to have a baby in his arms," his daughter said.
A memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. April 6 in St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Brattleboro, Vt.
Dr. Winn “was an exuberant and intense man about everything in his life," Ellen said.
“He was spectacular," Gregerson said. “He was kind of frighteningly articulate and upbeat and well-organized and well-read and filled with unflagging energy. It kind of left many of us in awe, frankly."

Texto completo: Boris Fishman's "Savage Feast: Three Generations, Two Continents, and a Dinner Table " tracks, in an expansive, leisurely way, the author's Jewish Russian family - two grandparents, his parents and himself - as they emigrate from the Soviet Union to Vienna to Rome to the United States in 1988 when the author was 9 years old. Throughout the memoir, Fishman's organizing theme is delicious, well-prepared food as the visible manifestation of love. A natural corollary, not surprisingly, is hunger, both the actual hunger experienced by older members of the family during World War II and the grown-up Fishman's metaphorical hunger for independence, success as a writer and romantic love. What's more, each chapter concludes with delicious Slavic recipes you and I can try at home.
The result is a work of reminiscence and celebration that should appeal to a wide range of readers. If you like books about affectionate, colorful families, imagine Irving Howe's "World of Our Fathers" mixed with Frank B. Gilbreth and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey's "Cheaper by the Dozen." If you're a fan of food memoirs, you'll want to shelve "Savage Feast" near M.F.K. Fisher's "The Art of Eating" and A.J. Liebling's "Between Meals." Anyone of Jewish or Slavic ancestry - I'm Russian Slovak - will find the accounts of raucous, argument-filled holiday dinners hilariously familiar: Been there, done that. Not least, if you're a young writer, especially one who comes from a home where the first language isn't English, you'll recognize aspects of yourself in Fishman, as he strives to balance love for his family - with its often insular protectiveness - and his need to make his own precarious way as an American novelist. In a familiar lament about immigrant parents and grandparents, he realizes that "the more I became the person they brought me to America to become, the less we seemed to share, and the harder all of us tried to pretend it wasn't happening."
While Fishman, like all of us, sometimes feels ambivalence about his family, there's no uncertainty about its food. His descriptions of even the simplest meals are mouthwatering:
"Grandma Daria . . . had a furnace the size of a bed. Out of it came crispy, quartered potatoes, dusted with dill before being slathered with sour cream; bowlegged, hand-lumped pork sausages; 'eye-melets'- eggs sunny-side up - sizzling and spitting after a quick fry up in the pork fat. Rough hunks of bread filled out the plate, as did chipped enamel mugs of boiling hot black tea with honey. The potatoes were freshly dug up; the sour cream came from the cows in the field, morosely observing the encroachment of winter; the eggs from the chickens prancing around the yard, the sausages from the season's first hog slaughter (a little early, but there were guests); the honey from the village bees, the bread from its rye. Only the black tea came from the store."
Note those mentions of pork. Though Jewish, the Fishmans are nonobservant atheists. When the family makes a brief visit to a synagogue, grandfather Arkady watches the ancient rituals for a few minutes, then loudly murmurs "fanatics" as they all leave.
It's quite a family. Boris's grandmother was a cutthroat cardsharp who played to win even against her little grandson. His mother always dressed to the nines before taking her son to his English lessons. Widowed grandfather Arkady - who, as a child, was expelled from first grade - flirts shamelessly with his 30-years-younger Ukrainian home aide (who turns out to be a fabulous cook). Boris's father - a barber in Russia, then a doorman in Manhattan - always foresees disaster. When his grown-up son organizes a trip to Florida, he almost bursts with anxiety: "How would we reach the airport? Would we drive or take a taxi? If we drove, where would we park? How much would that cost? . . . What if we didn't make the flight? . . . What if it snowed the night before we were supposed to go? . . . What if the hotel was no good? Where would we eat?"
Carrying his memoir up to the near present, Fishman closes with chapters about a crushing depression, a gradual recovery and the unusual courtship of the woman he now lives with. In his career he's done more than all right: His novels, "A Replacement Life" and "Don't Let My Baby Do Rodeo," were each chosen a New York Times notable book of the year, and Fishman himself is currently teaching in Princeton University's Creative Writing Program.
His obvious flair as a fiction writer may explain my own tiny misgivings about "Savage Feast." All memoirs tread a thin line between art and artfulness. Without design, a life narrative becomes a tedious jumble; with too much design, it starts to merge into fiction. In general, "Savage Feast" struck me as a bit too long: The stories tend to be overly drawn out, the often gorgeous prose slightly overwrought. More problematically, I wondered where memory left off and imaginative re-creation began. Fishman sets down pages and pages of conversation from 20 or 30 years ago. Is this plausible? At best he probably recollects the gist of what was said, then uses his artistic skills and knowledge of the people involved to create a scene that sharpens what he only vaguely recalls. Many readers will find this perfectly acceptable, but, alas, as a journalist, I always wonder about the degree of factuality. Of course, all autobiographical works are secretly tendentious, quietly adjusting history to fit a certain hypothesis or to justify a life.
Oh, well. Please don't make too much of my cavils, especially when balanced against Fishman's smorgasbord of humor, pathos and emotional insight. I very much enjoyed "Savage Feast," and so will you.

Texto completo: The restaurant business is tough. But in the right hands it can also be rewarding.
Jill and Chris Bacus, the husband and wife team behind Ciao Wood Fired Pizza & Trattoria in Cape Coral, opened their restaurant in 2011 when the downturn in the U.S. economy was slamming Southwest Florida.
Jill had a background in physical therapy and was caring for both her kids and her mother, who'd suffered a stroke. Chris worked in the corporate division of a large construction company.
"The construction industry tanked," Jill said, "and after 25 years, they sent him home."
The couple needed a new plan, and quickly. Though Chris figured he'd eventually be able to find another job in the construction industry, they realized that housing in Southwest Florida would take a long time to recover.
In the mean time, they asked themselves: What could they do?
"The only thing people were doing in this area during the recession was eating and drinking," Jill said.
"God's honest truth."
Though the pair didn't have a background in restaurants, they were used to hosting big dinner parties at their home.
"We would cook all Italian cuisine," Jill said, "and our friends and family would always say, 'Oh my. This is good. You guys need to open a restaurant.' That was a push in the direction of what our future was going to hold."
The couple took stock of their skillsets. Jill, who is originally from Wisconsin, grew up in an Italian household. Her grandparents emigrated to the U.S. from Calabria, in southern Italy, and her family's recipes would form the basis for her cooking at Ciao. Chris was from New Jersey, and though his heritage was German and Lithuanian, he'd grown up in pizza parlors and knew the secrets to making a good pie.
"My mom was a beautiful cook and a beautiful baker," Jill said, "and we just kind of pooled her recipes and decided to go for it on a wing and a prayer.
"It was our first restaurant ever."
She still remembers telling her mother about their plan.
"Oh Jill," her mother said. "That's going to be one of the hardest jobs ever."
Jill thought, "What? Making sauce and meatballs?"
Now, she admits her mother was right.
One of the reasons it's such a hard job? The Bacuses make everything at Ciao from scratch — 14 unique desserts, hand-tossed pizzas, pasta dishes, meat and seafood entrees.
"You have other restaurants who call Sysco and order all their products from them," Jill said. "Those places are food-preparers. We're food-creators. When we do eggplant, it's a three-hour process. When we make our lasagna, it's two and a half hours. It's very labor intensive."
And everything goes into the restaurant's 900-degree oak-fired oven.
Some of Ciao's most popular dishes includes its osso bucco, the classic Margherita pizza made with house-crafted mozzarella, wood-fired duck served with berry sauce, the seven-layer lasagna and, of course, Jill's scratch-made desserts — her ricotta cheesecake, creme brulee, chocolate mousse and various pastries such as her limoncello torte, a recent special.
The Bacuses recognize that Ciao has done exceptionally well in its eight years. Of the 14 restaurants that opened up in the downtown Cape Coral area at the same time, Jill says, Ciao is one of the only ones still in business.
"On my end of it, I grew up with my siblings and it was a very close family," she said. "When anyone came to our home, we welcomed them as family.
So, we have that corporate end from my husband and we have that family end from me, which created a great business profile for us."
One that continues to be rewarding.

Texto completo: The five Taliban leaders who President Barack Obama freed from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for U.S. Army deserter Bowe Bergdahl are now part of the Taliban’s peace talks in Qatar with the U.S. government.

The former detainees, dubbed “the Taliban Five,” had been high-ranking members of the Taliban government prior to its overthrow by U.S. forces in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The five men were released by the Obama administration and arrived in Qatar on June 1, 2014. Bergdahl was released on May 31, 2014, as part of the prisoner exchange.

The U.S. government, led by U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad, has been negotiating for months with Taliban representatives in Qatar. The Afghan government, led by President Ashraf Ghani, has been excluded from these discussions at the request of the Taliban, to the government's frustration. Afghan national security adviser Hamdullah harshly criticized Khalilzad’s efforts, and the U.S. recently walked out of a meeting at the presidential palace in Kabul in what was seen by many as a snub in response.

The New York Times reports that the Taliban has purposely made the Taliban Five a prominent part of its talks in Qatar: “In recent months, as the American and militants took up intense negotiations to try to end the conflict in Afghanistan, the Taliban leadership made a point of including the former prisoners. Each day during the recent round of talks in Doha, Qatar, the five men sat face to face with American diplomats and generals.”

The Taliban Five are Norullah Noori, Mohammad Fazl, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khairullah Khairkhwa, and Mohammad Nabi Omari. Noori was a Taliban governor and is believed to be involved with the massacres of thousands of Hazara, Uzbek, and other Shiite minorities. Fazl was a high-ranking official in the Taliban military and also engaged in large-scale ethno-sectarian killing. Wasiq was a member of the Taliban’s intelligence services and worked with outside terror organizations. Khairkhwa helped found the Taliban and was close to Mohammad Omar and Osama bin Laden. And Omari was accused of having connections to al Qaeda, the Haqqani Network, and other groups.

The Taliban regime was among the most repressive and brutal in the world, its treatment of women and religious minorities was abhorrent, and it actively harbored and protected al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden for years. The Obama administration's decision to release the Taliban Five in exchange for Bergdahl had been opposed by many at the Pentagon and was strongly criticized by Republicans at the time.

The peace talks come amid continued fighting between the U.S. and the Taliban.

Two U.S. soldiers, Spc. Joseph P. Collette and Sgt. 1st Class Will D. Lindsay, were killed in Afghanistan last Friday. They died in Kunduz Province as a result of wounds they suffered during combat operations during Operation Freedom's Sentinel, the U.S. counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan. The Taliban claimed credit for the attack.

More than 2,400 U.S. service members have been killed and more than 20,000 wounded in Afghanistan since combat operations began there in October 2001.

There are roughly 14,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan helping train the Afghan Armed Forces. The U.S. also carries out counterinsurgency and counterterrorism efforts against the Taliban, al Qaeda, ISIS, and other terrorist elements that have found a safe haven in the country.

The Taliban has also continued its attacks on the Afghan National Army throughout the peace talks, with one such high-profile assault earlier this month resulting in an entire Afghan company being wiped out.

Khalilzad claims that the U.S. and the Taliban have tentatively agreed on two aspects of an agreement: a timeline for U.S. withdrawal from the country and guarantees from the Taliban that foreign terrorists would not be welcome. Many are skeptical of the Taliban’s trustworthiness on following through on its assurances.

Gen. Austin Scott Miller, commander of NATO's Resolute Support Mission and U.S. Forces - Afghanistan, was nearly killed by the Taliban in an assassination attempt last October, but has been involved with the peace talks.

According to the New York Times, Gen. Miller told the Taliban that he respected them as fighters but that the war needed to end. He also evoked a mutual need to fight the terrorism of the Islamic State.”

“We could keep fighting, keep killing each other, or, together, we could kill ISIS,” Miller said.

Some longtime analysts of Afghanistan are skeptical of the Taliban's ability and willingness to keep the Islamic State and al Qaeda in check.

Many inside Afghanistan are also skeptical that the Taliban can change. Haji Khalil Dare Sufi, described as an elder at Kabul’s Al Zahra mosque and a member of Afghanistan’s Hazara minority, said “The Taliban will always be the Taliban. They have been brutal to the Hazara people.”

“They can talk all they want in Doha, but there can be no good result,” Sufi said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A Republican member of Congress quoted Adolf Hitler on the House floor in an attempt to blast Democrats over the results of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible conspiracy with the Trump presidential campaign.
Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks read from Hitler's "Mein Kampf" in an attempt to bash Democrats and the media, alleging they had pushed a "big lie" to smear Trump during the investigation.
"A big lie is a political propaganda technique made famous by Germany's national socialist German Worker's Party," Brooks said Monday. "For more than two years, socialist Democrats and their fake news media allies, CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, Washington Post and countless others, have perpetrated the biggest political lie, con, scam and fraud in American history. "

Brooks railed against Democrats, citing from a four-page letter Attorney General William Barr sent to members of Congress on Sunday. The letter summarized the conclusions of Mueller's lengthy investigation and explained that Mueller did not find conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign. Mueller could not determine whether President Donald Trump attempted to obstruct justice by impeding the investigation, according to the letter.
After reviewing the evidence, Barr determined no criminal charges would be filed against the president.
Brooks railed against Democrats for pushing the Russian conspiracy for years and the media for helping give them a voice.
He called for Democrats and the media to apologize for the "fraud and scam committed" but said he recognized that some would be more likely to "double down and propagate even more big lies because doubling down is essential to big lie theory. "
"In that vein, I quote from another socialist who mastered big lie propaganda to a maximum and deadly effect," Brooks said before starting to read Hitler's words on the House floor.
He started, "In the big lie, there is always a certain force of credibility because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus, in the primitive simplicity of their minds, they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie.

"Who is this big lie master? That quote was in 1925 by a member of Germany's National Socialist German Workers Party," he said. "That's right. Germany's Socialist Party, more commonly known as the Nazis. The author was socialist Adolf Hitler in his book, 'Mein Kampf. '"
Brooks' emphasis on socialism in Germany appeared to be an attempt to link socialism with the Democratic Party — even though Nazis were not, in fact, socialists. They, along with Hitler, were fascists, essentially the opposite of socialists. Hitler was the leader of the Nazi Party that initiated World War II and was central in the death of millions during the Holocaust.
While on the House floor, Brooks also called on Americans to reject "America's socialists and their fake news media allies" or "succumb to the danger that lurks and horrific damage that results. "
Brooks' office did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.

UNAMBIGUOUSLY GOOD NEWS FOR THE U.S. BARR'S LETTER ON THE MUELLER REPORT SHOULD BE A RELIEF FOR THE AMERICAN BODY POLITIC

Texto completo: On Sunday, Attorney General William Barr released his summary of the "principal conclusions reached by the special counsel and the results of his investigation." The document is light on details, but it contains a key quote from the special counsel's report itself. Here it is, in full: "The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."
This is unambiguously good news. If you doubt this, consider the alternative. Just imagine the bomb that would detonate in the American body politic if we discovered through this investigation that a sitting president worked with a hostile government (arguably our chief geopolitical foe) to try to tip the balance in a close election.
Instead, Americans should feel even greater confidence in the legitimacy of the 2016 election. They should reject - once and for all - the lurid conspiracy theories that have dominated parts of the internet and gained entirely too much purchase in the broader media. And critically, they should trust Robert Mueller's conclusion. Remember how Mr. Trump's defenders repeatedly and loudly noted that Mr. Mueller staffed his team with Democratic lawyers? Well, this is their report. Earlier today, MSNBC's Joy Reid said that "it feels like the seeds of a cover-up are here." This is irresponsible rhetoric. There is no evidence of a cover-up. Instead, there's a great deal of evidence that Mr. Mueller conducted a thorough and diligent investigation.
So, what's next? I agree with my colleague Andrew McCarthy. The American people need full disclosure - and not just of the Mueller report itself. We need to see relevant FISA applications, supporting documents, classified testimony and any other evidence relevant to the Mueller investigation and to the inception of the Trump-Russia investigation. This conclusion is rendered even more urgent by two important political realities.
The first relates to the obstruction of justice. As Mr. Barr explains in his letter, the Mueller report neither accuses Mr. Trump of committing obstruction of justice in the course of the investigation, nor does it exonerate him. Instead, the attorney general and deputy attorney general (both Trump appointees) examined the evidence and concluded that the evidence was "not sufficient" to conclude that the president obstructed justice. Democrats will trust this conclusion exactly as much as Republicans would trust a Democratic attorney general to evaluate the actions of a Democratic president.
The second important political reality relates to a common Republican theory of the Trump-Russia investigation - that it was conceived and pursued in bad faith, for wholly partisan political reasons. Under this theory, the entire Trump-Russia controversy truly began with an act of Democratic collusion - Hillary Clinton campaign's commissioning of Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research that became the infamous "Steele dossier." In other words, there certainly was "worse-than-Watergate" corruption in 2016, but it was Democratic corruption.
Based on the publicly available evidence, I agree with Trey Gowdy. There would have been an investigation without the dossier. As he said, it had "nothing to do with [Donald Trump Jr.'s] meeting at Trump Tower." It had "nothing to do with George Papadopoulos' meeting in Great Britain. It also doesn't have anything to do with obstruction of justice." But that doesn't mean the creation and use of the dossier was proper, or that the worst Republican allegations shouldn't be examined and evaluated once and for all.
Finally, nothing in Mr. Barr's letter excuses the fact that Mr. Trump hired and surrounded himself with some of the worst people in politics - felons and liars who sometimes committed crimes in the ham-handed attempt to cover up their own contacts or attempted contacts with Russian assets or operatives. The president's personal lawyer, his campaign chair, his longtime friend and adviser, and his first national security adviser (among others) each engaged in patterns of deception that were not only criminal but created real and genuine alarm in fair-minded Americans that at least some people in the president's inner circle were more than willing to work with our enemies abroad to gain financial or political advantage here at home.
But these facts notwithstanding, there are still grounds for immense relief that America's most recent presidential election has been (further) legitimized and that years of speculation about Mr. Trump's ties to the Russian government have proven unfounded.
These last 30 months of investigations - beginning well before Mr. Mueller's appointment - have been among the most divisive and contentious events in modern political history. As we wait to read the full report and move into the inevitable battles over its contents, we can be sure that more division and contention await. Yet today, at least, we can be grateful for the good news we have, and it is good news indeed.

Ike was right for his time, and offers insight for ours

Resumen: By nature a moderate Eisenhower was popular for the good reason that he grasped what Americans wanted in the 1950s: peace and prosperity, and a pause from the steady New Deal/Fair Deal expansion of federal authority. When one tabulates Eisenhower’s legislative successes during his two terms, the list of notable accomplishments is impressive, including the Interstate Highway System, the creation of NASA, and the National Defense Education Act. When Federal Aviation Administration head Elwood Quesada inadvertently revealed an embargoed plan to the media and made his way with a resignation letter to the Oval Office, the president clapped him on the back and told him to go back to work.

Texto completo: When Dwight Eisenhower died half a century ago this week, tributes flowed freely, highlighting his role in crushing Nazism during World War II. Meanwhile, Ike’s steadiness as 34th president during the height of the Cold War and his pragmatic approach to domestic affairs received less credit.
Leading columnists, including the New York Times’ Tom Wicker, called Ike a poster boy for the American dream — the Kansas farm boy made good. But few contemporary observers much appreciated the degree to which that “ordinary fellow” from the heart of America — as Ike liked to describe himself — was a sly and effective politician and a deft, behind-the-scenes puppet master.
For a generation, students of the Eisenhower presidency were fed the notion, perhaps most influentially purveyed by Harvard political scientist Richard Neustadt, that Eisenhower was essentially a do-nothing executive, disengaged from the dance of legislation, more a benign monarch than an active political leader. Democratic strategist Clark Clifford said Ike never understood “the potential or the dynamics of the presidency.” And Stanford University historian David Kennedy called Ike’s domestic record “stubbornly inert.”
We know better now, thanks to fresh scholarship.
By nature a moderate
Eisenhower was popular for the good reason that he grasped what Americans wanted in the 1950s: peace and prosperity, and a pause from the steady New Deal/Fair Deal expansion of federal authority. When Ike ran for re-election in 1956, the Republican slogan was “everything’s booming except the guns.” Democratic foe Adlai Stevenson never had a chance.
On the 50th anniversary of Ike’s passing, it is worth recalling what was distinctive about the 1950s, and what lessons from his presidency are relevant in today’s political climate.
He was by nature a moderate. Ike could never make up his mind whether to call himself a Jeffersonian Republican, a Wilsonian liberal or a “Modern Republican” — the latter speechwriter Arthur Larson’s concoction. Whatever the brand, Eisenhower fit the temper of the 1950s, when millions of war veterans focused on building families and communities. Above all, they wanted to feel secure in order to pursue their American dreams.
Eisenhower offered that security, but not by building ever more expensive weapons or keeping unnecessarily large numbers of Americans in uniform. He was bent, rather, on assuring the economic health of the nation through programs advancing infrastructure, health and education, new technologies — tied to budget restraint. When one tabulates Eisenhower’s legislative successes during his two terms, the list of notable accomplishments is impressive, including the Interstate Highway System, the creation of NASA, and the National Defense Education Act. Each has had lasting positive impact.
Acting as a leader
Eisenhower never perceived political opponents or the press as his enemy. He seems genuinely to have enjoyed his private sessions over bourbon and branch water with Democratic Congressional leaders Sam Rayburn and Lyndon B. Johnson. His relationship with members of the White House press corps tended to be more correct than close, but he also was the first president to make major nationally televised addresses and hold weekly, televised press conferences.
As a leader, Eisenhower was both tough and compassionate. Richard Nixon spoke of deviousness as a regular tool in Ike’s tool kit and his backbone of steel. Yet, Eisenhower knew how to sustain morale on his White House team by praising those staffers who made good and by showing patience when they erred.
Rather than firing an errant subordinate, Eisenhower would assure him he had a rule of allowing one mistake per year to anyone associated with him. When Federal Aviation Administration head Elwood Quesada inadvertently revealed an embargoed plan to the media and made his way with a resignation letter to the Oval Office, the president clapped him on the back and told him to go back to work. Quesada recalled that he would have “walked on coals” for Eisenhower.
Eisenhower was a stickler for preparation. He believed that rapidly changing events made rigid adherence to fixed plans impossible, but planning made for needed flexibility. This helps explain Ike’s caution in assisting the French in Indochina in 1954 and his unflappability during the Suez and Hungarian crises in 1956. Both allies and enemies grasped this, which doubtless ratcheted back the potential for a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union.
Washington Post editorial cartoonist Herbert Block (“Herblock”) cast Ike as consistently indecisive, whether the issue was McCarthyism or civil rights. In reality, while Eisenhower showed great restraint publicly in dealing with problematic characters, he was more than capable of taking decisive action (as at Little Rock in 1957).
In 1954, Eisenhower kneecapped the greatest demagogue of his time — Joe McCarthy — without Herblock or virtually anyone noticing his agency.
Eisenhower’s philosophy meshed with that of stevedore philosopher Eric Hoffer, who warned against isms both left and right. Authoritarian followers, Ike observed, were afraid of both facts and freedom. Americans, by contrast, would read widely and engage vigorous debate on all meaningful issues.
Eisenhower did not make all the right calls as president, but his percentage of right calls was high. He was the right president for his time. He left office with a budget surplus and the nation at peace. His winning smile and sunny personality bespoke his era.
But he also speaks to the present. Ike’s prescient warning about the “military-industrial complex” remains relevant. His emphasis on the importance of economic security as key to military strength, his belief in alliances (most especially so with European democracies), his concern for human dignity, his refusal to denigrate the critical press, mock or demonize political foes — these are qualities that make the nation’s 34th president worth remembering on this anniversary of his passing.

Texto completo: California police say they are investigating a fire at a mosque as an arson and a hate crime after graffiti that made reference to the deadly New Zealand mosque attacks was found at the scene.
The incident happened early Sunday about 30 miles north of San Diego in Escondido, police said in a release. Police say the graffiti was left by the suspected arsonist.
Seven people were in the mosque at the time, but no one was injured, police say. The fire caused minor damage to the outside of the building.
The San Diego office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the incident: "It is disturbing enough that some sick individual would attempt to burn a house of worship to the ground, but referencing the slayings in New Zealand is beyond the pale," Executive Director Dustin Craun said in a written statement.
The statement says the California incident was motivated by the "same hatred" held by a gunman who killed 50 people in a terrorist attack on two mosques in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand.
An emotional return: New Zealand shootings: Family of slain boy visits Christchurch mosque as it reopens
Police believe the fire was set with an accelerant, but there are no suspects as of Tuesday, The New York Times reported. The fire, which scorched an outside wall, was put out using a fire extinguisher, the newspaper reports, citing police.
Escondido police said Sunday that Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives agents are assisting with the investigation.

Texto completo: There have been tipping points and bombshells, walls closing in and turning points. And there have been so, so many declarations of "The beginning of the end!" that the comedian John Oliver had a recurring, satirical "We got him!" segment on his late-night HBO show, complete with a jubilant marching band and sequined majorettes celebrating President Trump's downfall.
But in the swirl of reporting and speculation about the 45th president, nothing has held viewers on the edge of their seats quite like the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and his investigation into possible ties between Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and Russian agents.
The story line had it all: Cold War-era intrigue, allegations of shadowy meetings in Moscow and a cast of recurring characters that included an aide in a $15,000 ostrich skin jacket (Paul D. Manafort) and another who has a tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back (Roger Stone).
Mr. Mueller's complete report hasn't yet been released, but on Sunday, Attorney General William P. Barr made public a four-page letter to Congress reporting that the 22-month inquiry did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that Mr. Trump and his associates "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government" ahead of the 2016 election. The news blindsided many liberals -- particularly those with an ambient knowledge of Rachel Maddow's nightly monologues on MSNBC.
Who could blame them? The news media's coverage of the investigation, particularly on cable TV, caused millions of Americans who disapprove of Mr. Trump to put their faith in Mr. Mueller. There were even prayer candles, key chains and paintings made in the likeness of the silent 74-year-old Marine veteran, and his fans believed his looming report would bring, in the words of the "Bachelor" creator Mike Fleiss, "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
When that didn't happen, Mr. Trump and his allies placed blame on the news media for its ravenous coverage. "I think Democrats and the liberal media owe the president and they owe the American people an apology," the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on NBC News's Today.
Rich Lowry, the editor of the conservative National Review, wrote on Twitter, "The 3 biggest losers from the Mueller report in order -- the media, the media, the media."
It was a bipartisan ripping. Matt Taibbi, a Rolling Stone writer whose book on the 2016 election is titled "Insane Clown President," is not exactly a fan of Mr. Trump. And yet he called the apparent lack of new charges resulting from the special counsel's investigation "a death blow for the reputation of the American news media." He compared it to the erroneous reporting on weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the Iraq war.
Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said that, by his count, The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and MSNBC had published a combined 8,500 stories on the Russia probe. He specifically pointed to CNN and chyrons that would include the phrase "amid Russia investigation," no matter what the topic.
"It's so painfully obvious they wanted it to be true so badly, and the last two years of their lives and two years of their news coverage has been an entire waste," Mr. Gidley said.
Jeff Zucker, president of CNN, said he was "entirely comfortable" with the network's coverage.
"We are not investigators. We are journalists, and our role is to report the facts as we know them, which is exactly what we did," Mr. Zucker said in an email. "A sitting president's own Justice Department investigated his campaign for collusion with a hostile nation. That's not enormous because the media says so. That's enormous because it's unprecedented."
Bill Grueskin, a professor at the Columbia School of Journalism, said there seemed to be some confusion about the role of journalists. "Mueller and Barr need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt -- do we file charges or don't we?" he said. "Journalists don't have that standard."
In other words, Pulitzer Prize-winning reports of alleged wrongdoing do not need to provide evidence of criminality in order to be factual, newsworthy and relevant to readers.
"The special counsel investigation documented, as we reported, extensive Russian interference in the 2016 election and widespread deceit on the part of certain advisers to the president about Russian contacts and other matters," said Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post. "Our job is to bring facts to light. Others make determinations about prosecutable criminal offenses."
Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, echoed that sentiment. "We wrote a lot about Russia, and I have no regrets," he said. "It's not our job to determine whether or not there was illegality."
But in the nearly two years of the Russia investigation, there have been several high-profile mea culpas.
ABC News apologized and parted ways with its chief investigative correspondent, Brian Ross, after an errant report that Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, had been directed by Mr. Trump to make contact with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. Three seasoned investigative journalists at CNN resigned after the network retracted a report that a close Trump aide had ties to a Russian investment firm. Mr. Mueller publicly rebuked a BuzzFeed News account that Mr. Trump had instructed his longtime lawyer Michael D. Cohen to lie in his testimony to Congress. (BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting.)
"It's pretty clear that a lot of people in the media, particularly on cable news, got ahead of their skis on this," said Michael Isikoff, a co-author of "Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump."
Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, defended coverage of the Russian investigation, including the decision to publish a dossier put together by British intelligence officer Christopher Steele full of tantalizing (and unsubstantiated) reports about Russian efforts to blackmail Mr. Trump.
"It's pretty hard to imagine a scenario in which people were aware of its existence but not allowed to see it," Mr. Smith said of the dossier.
The editor also expressed concern that journalism was so often churned -- and reduced -- through the filter of partisan punditry.
"I think it's a moment when the public conversation favors partisans who are totally convinced in the rightness of what they're saying and doesn't favor reporters who are cautious about what they know and are trying to get things right," Mr. Smith said.
That may be true, but in the current ecosystem of political news, when shoe-leather reporters moonlight as cable news analysts, it can be hard for typical viewers to distinguish the pundits from the press.
Even if more damning findings come out in the full report, Mr. Trump has already cast the narrative that he is absolved and that the "fake news" media is to be blamed, said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and former adviser to Mitt Romney.
"You see the president's most vocal supporters, they're touting the headlines that the president was exonerated and vindicated and where are the apologies from the media?" he said.
Those apologies aren't likely to come, as long as the same people who have been trying to erode trust in factual reporting are now ones demanding a reckoning.
"We will hold every fake news media liar member accountable," Sean Hannity wrote Sunday on Twitter.
Mr. Fleiss, the producer, who knew Mr. Trump in his "Apprentice" years, said cable news had taken a page from the president's reality TV playbook in teasing every development in the Russia investigation as if it were the final blow.
"He's a master exaggerator, been doing it his entire life," Mr. Fleiss said. "The rookies tried to keep up and got burned."

Apple brings out the big stars as it promotes its coming subscription services

Texto completo: Steve Jobs was a master of the product announcement, sporting his signature black turtleneck while unveiling Apple products like the iPhone. That best-selling device has lost some of its commercial sheen, but Apple still has some salespeople with stage presence: namely, Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and other Hollywood celebrities who pitched Apple's much anticipated video streaming service Monday in the theater named after the late Apple co-founder.
Monday's event on Apple's campus in Cupertino, Calif., was something altogether different. The company unveiled paid subscriptions for news, video games and an entertainment service that looks a lot like a competitor to Netflix and HBO, though Apple didn't say how much it would cost. The only product it announced that consumers could actually touch and feel was a titanium credit card, so minimalist in its design that it doesn't even include a number.
As more celebrities, including J.J. Abrams, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell, walked onto Apple's stage, the theme became increasingly apparent. Apple doesn't want to be thought of as a gadget-maker. Rather, it wants to touch every corner of its customers' lives, from the music they listen to, the TV they watch and the news they read to the games they play, and even the payment method they use to buy milk and eggs.
As Jobs's handpicked successor as chief executive, Tim Cook, put it, Apple is now about "services that deliver incredible content and experiences directly to you whenever and wherever you are."
For stars like Winfrey, the draw to create content for Apple was a simple calculation: "Because they're in a billion pockets, y'all. A billion pockets," she said onstage. Such wide reach creates an "opportunity to make a genuine impact," she said.
Apple is expected to invest many billions a year, according to analysts, to make video content to compete in a crowded market that includes Amazon, Netflix, Hulu and Disney. It's a gamble, and it signals just how important these new businesses are to Apple - especially as growth in its gadgets slows. Apple signaled to investors in January that it would miss targets on iPhone sales, mainly because of slowing sales in China.
To tide Apple over before the shift from mobile technology that has driven spending for a decade to the next generation of devices, Apple is becoming increasingly dependent on services - sales of music and data storage that it complemented with the new subscription products announced Monday. Apple is working on developing new gadgets, such as augmented reality glasses, but it can't count on a big shift happening again any time soon.
In that way, spending billions on its own content might be a less risky proposition for Apple than waiting on the sidelines of streaming. The online entertainment world is starting to consolidate into a handful of gigantic players, and there was no guarantee that they would continue to allow their content to rely on Apple's platform, with Apple getting a cut of the revenue.
By creating a high-end streaming service, Apple gives itself a chance of becoming one of the few big players in the industry that is capable of controlling its own destiny, without being at the mercy of other platforms. It can use the content in any way it chooses, to help sell devices through promotions or license it to other platforms for extra revenue.
Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures, estimates Apple will make $15 billion a year from video streaming and Apple TV in five years, another $3 billion from video games and about $1.5 billion from its credit card revenue.
The first announcement of the day was a new service called Apple News+, a $10-a-month subscription service that will include magazines such as Sports Illustrated and the New Yorker.
What Apple didn't talk about in its presentation is that it had largely failed to convince some of the largest newspapers, including the New York Times and The Washington Post, to participate in the service. Though it briefly featured the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times during the presentation, it more or less focused on magazines.
The question for the news industry is whether the service takes off, bringing in significant revenue for participating publications. If that happens, it could cause larger publications like the Post and the Times to reconsider sitting it out. "At this stage in the game, they are probably smart not to do it," said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a technology market research firm. "But I have to believe they have to keep the option open."
Next, Apple announced the Apple Card, which builds on the popularity of its Apple Pay service that allows people to pay for products using their phones and watches. Offering its own credit card, with the backing of Goldman Sachs and MasterCard, helps Apple to cut out some of the middlemen in payment transactions. Apple is offering consumers competitive cash back and no late fees.
Next, Apple announced a new video game subscription service. Cook said iOS has become the largest gaming platform in the world, with roughly 300,000 games on the platform. With the gaming subscription service, called Apple Arcade, the company says it has created a way to help developers monetize their games.
Apple Arcade appears positioned to compete in some ways with Google's new Stadia service, which was announced last week. No price has been announced for Arcade or Stadia.
Apple made the biggest splash with the announcement of its video streaming service, Apple TV+, in large part because it came with cameo appearances from some of the biggest names in Hollywood.
While other streaming services have focused on obtaining the rights to franchises such as "Star Trek" or "The Avengers," Apple's strategy has been to go for star actors and producers. That fits its longtime approach, said Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy. "It's all about the brand," he said.
That comes with some risks, Downes said. Big names don't guarantee success, and even the most decorated in Hollywood have failed at least once or twice.
Last week, as hype around Monday's event built up, Apple made three hardware announcements - upgrades to its iMac Pro, iPad Mini and AirPods. There was no news conference devoted to those announcements.

Los gurús digitales de Silicon Valley crían a sus hijos sin pantallas

Texto completo: La profesora, armada con tizas de colores, suma fracciones en el gran encerado, enmarcado en madera rústica, que cubre la pared frontal de la clase. Los niños de cuarto grado, de 9 y 10 años, hacen sus cuentas en los pupitres con lápiz y cuartillas. El aula está forrada de papeles: mensajes, horarios, trabajos de los alumnos. Ninguno ha salido de una impresora. Nada, ni siquiera los libros de texto, que elaboran los propios niños a mano, ha sido realizado por ordenador. No hay detalle alguno en esta clase que pudiera desentonar en los recuerdos escolares de un adulto que asistió al colegio el siglo pasado. Pero estamos en Palo Alto. El corazón de Silicon Valley. Epicentro de la economía digital. Hábitat de quienes piensan, producen y venden la tecnología que transforma la sociedad del siglo XXI.
Escuelas de medio mundo se esfuerzan por introducir ordenadores, tabletas, pizarras interactivas y otros prodigios tecnológicos . Pero aquí, en el Waldorf of Peninsula, colegio privado donde se educan los hijos de directivos de Apple, Google y otros gigantes tecnológicos que rodean a esta antigua granja en la bahía de San Francisco, no entra una pantalla hasta que llegan a secundaria .
“No creemos en la caja negra, esa idea de que metes algo en una máquina y sale un resultado sin que se comprenda lo que pasa dentro. Si haces un círculo perfecto con un ordenador, pierdes al ser humano tratando de lograr esa perfección. Lo que detona el aprendizaje es la emoción, y son los humanos los que producen esa emoción, no las máquinas. La creatividad es algo esencialmente humano. Si le pones una pantalla a un niño pequeño limitas sus habilidades motoras, su tendencia a expandirse, su capacidad de concentración. No hay muchas certezas en todo esto. Tendremos las respuestas en 15 años, cuando estos niños sean adultos. ¿Pero queremos asumir el riesgo?”, se pregunta Pierre Laurent, padre de tres hijos, ingeniero informático que trabajó en Microsoft, Intel y diversas startups, y ahora preside el patronato del colegio.
Sus palabras ilustran lo que empieza a ser un consenso entre las élites de Silicon Valley. Los adultos que mejor comprenden la tecnología de los móviles y las aplicaciones quieren a sus hijos lejos de ella. Los beneficios de las pantallas en la educación temprana son limitados, sostienen, mientras que el riesgo de adicción es alto.
Los pioneros lo tuvieron claro desde muy pronto. Bill Gates, creador de Microsoft, limitó el tiempo de pantalla de sus hijos. “No tenemos los teléfonos en la mesa cuando estamos comiendo y no les dimos móviles hasta que cumplieron los 14 años”, dijo en 2017. “En casa limitamos el uso de tecnología a nuestros hijos”, explicó Steve Jobs, creador de Apple, en una entrevista en The New York Times en 2010, en la que aseguró que prohibía a sus vástagos utilizar su recién creado iPad. “En la escala entre los caramelos y el crack, esto está más cerca del crack”, apuntaba también en The New York Times Chris Anderson, exdirector de la revista Wired, biblia de la cultura digital.
Laurent, que no le dio un móvil a su hijo pequeño hasta noveno grado (14 o 15 años), alerta de un peligroso cambio en el modelo de negocio del que ha sido testigo en su vida profesional. “Cualquiera que hace una aplicación quiere que sea fácil de usar”, explica. “Eso es así desde el principio. Pero antes queríamos que el usuario estuviera contento para que comprase el producto. Ahora, con los smartphones y las tabletas, el modelo de negocio es otro: el producto es gratis, pero se recogen datos y se ponen anuncios. Por eso, el objetivo hoy es que el usuario pase más tiempo en la aplicación, para poder recoger más datos o poner más anuncios. Es decir, la razón de ser de la aplicación es que el usuario pase el mayor tiempo posible ante la pantalla. Están diseñadas para eso”.
El problema de la relación de los niños y la tecnología es que el ritmo vertiginoso al que se transforma dificulta la reflexión y el estudio. Una investigación de Common Sense Media, organización sin ánimo de lucro “dedicada a ayudar a los niños a desarrollarse en un mundo de medios y tecnología”, da una idea de la velocidad de los cambios: los niños estadounidenses de cero a ocho años pasaban en 2017 una media de 48 minutos al día ante el móvil, tres veces más que en 2013 y 10 veces más que en 2011. “¿Cuándo empezó todo este furor por los teléfonos inteligentes?”, se pregunta María Álvarez, vicepresidenta de la organización. “No tiene más que 12 o 13 años. Y las primeras tabletas aún menos. Hace falta que mucha investigación aún para determinar cuál es realmente el impacto que esta exposición a las pantallas puede tener en los niños pequeños. Pero hay algunos estudios que empiezan a ver una relación entre esta tecnología y ciertos hitos en la educación. Ofrecen indicaciones que los padres deben tener en cuenta”.
Una investigación publicada en enero de este año en la revista médica JAMA pediatrics reveló que un tiempo mayor ante la pantalla a los dos y tres años está asociado con retrasos de los niños en alcanzar hitos de desarrollo dos años después. Otros estudios relacionan el uso excesivo de móviles en adolescentes con la falta de sueño, el riesgo de depresión y hasta de suicidios. La Academia de Pediatras de Estados Unidos publicó unas recomendaciones en 2016: evitar el uso de pantallas para los menores de 18 meses; solo contenidos de calidad y visionados en compañía de los padres, para niños entre 18 y 24 meses; una hora al día de contenidos de calidad para niños de entre dos y cinco años; y, a partir de los seis años, límites coherentes en el tiempo de uso y el contenido.
Sucede que poner límites no es fácil para los padres trabajadores. Y eso lleva a una redefinición de lo que significa la brecha digital. Hasta hace no mucho, la preocupación era que los niños más ricos contasen con una ventaja por acceder antes a Internet. Hoy, según Common Sense Media, el 98% de los hogares con hijos en EE UU tienen teléfonos móviles, frente a un 52% en 2011. Cuando la tecnología se ha generalizado, el problema es el contrario: que las familias con un elevado poder adquisitivo tienen más fácil impedir que sus niños se pasen el día ante el móvil. Mientras los hijos de las élites de Silicon Valley se crían entre pizarras y juguetes de madera, los de las clases bajas y medias crecen pegados a pantallas.
Los adolescentes de hogares con menos ingresos, según un estudio de Common Sense Media, pasan dos horas y 45 minutos al día más ante las pantallas que aquellos de hogares de ingresos altos. Otros estudios indican que los niños blancos están significativamente menos expuestos a las pantallas que los negros o hispanos.
La brecha se ve incluso dentro de Silicon Valley. Conduciendo 15 minutos hacia el norte desde el Waldorf of Peninsula, centro cuya matrícula ronda los 30.000 dólares anuales, se llega al colegio público Hillview. El primero no introduce las pantallas hasta la secundaria. El segundo publicita un programa por el que cada alumno cuenta con un iPad. En el primero, recibe al visitante un rústico espantapájaros situado en una huerta que cultivan los alumnos. En el segundo, una pantalla de leds que expone los anuncios del día.
“¿Cuántas familias trabajadoras se pueden permitir el lujo de alejar a sus hijos completamente de las pantallas?”, se pregunta Álvarez, de Common Sense Media. “No creo que sea algo realista para la mayoría de los hogares. Yo tengo un hijo de 12 y otro de 6. Ni sé las veces que se han tirado al suelo gritando como locos si yo les quito la tableta. He estado en esa posición como madre y sé que no es fácil”.
Trabajadores de las grandes tecnológicas se reunieron el año pasado en una iniciativa bautizada como La Verdad Sobre la Tecnología . Su objetivo es convencer a las empresas de la necesidad de introducir parámetros éticos en el diseño de herramientas que utilizan a diario miles de millones de personas, incluidos niños. “La ingeniería informática durante mucho tiempo era algo muy técnico, no había una idea clara del impacto que iba a tener en la gente, y menos aún en los niños”, explica Pierre Laurent. “No existía una conciencia de que había que lidiar con la ética. Algo que sí pasa, por ejemplo, si trabajas en la industria médica. En la tecnología nunca ha habido un código ético claro”.
Es una lucha desigual. Padres multitarea contra equipos de ingenieros y psicólogos que diseñan tecnología para mantener a sus hijos enganchados. Pero algo está empezando a cambiar. Los gigantes tecnológicos, cada vez más cuestionados en sus políticas comerciales y de privacidad, empiezan a introducir cambios en sus productos, tímidas excepciones al sacrosanto principio de captar más atención.
El año pasado, dos grandes inversores de Apple, Jana Partners y CalSTRS (el fondo de jubilación de profesores de California), poseedores conjuntamente de cerca de 2.000 millones de dólares en acciones, enviaron una carta abierta a los jefes de la empresa de Cupertino, pidiendo que tomasen más medidas contra la adicción de los niños a los móviles. “Hemos revisado la evidencia y creemos que hay una clara necesidad de que Apple ofrezca a los padres más opciones y herramientas para ayudarles a asegurarse de que los consumidores jóvenes utilizan vuestros productos de manera óptima”, escribieron.
Apple respondió introduciendo Screen Time, una nueva herramienta que ayuda a controlar y limitar el uso del móvil. Google ha incorporado una herramienta similar, Digital Wellbeing. Para los críticos, son solo parches que no atacan el problema de fondo: la naturaleza adictiva de los productos. Hasta que eso se aborde, serán los padres los responsables de guiar a sus hijos en este mundo de potencial incierto.
“Nosotros animamos a los padres a que sean más proactivos a la hora de buscar el contenido”, concluye Álvarez. “La clave es cómo aprendemos a equilibrar, a sacarle provecho, a limitar el uso y a saber que, por su salud física y mental, tiene que haber momentos en la familia en los que no se use nada. Tenemos una campaña que invita a comer y cenar sin móviles, sin que haya un aparato constantemente interrumpiendo con notificaciones. Recomendamos también el uso compartido de los dispositivos, y hablar con los niños sobre lo que ven. Y es importante el modelo que somos para nuestros hijos. Si estamos compulsivamente viendo el móvil, justificando que es por trabajo, ¿qué mensaje les estamos trasladando?”.
La obsesión en Silicon Valley por alejar a los niños de la tecnología trasciende las paredes de las aulas. Cuando los chavales salen del colegio, se intenta que sigan sin tocar ni ver pantallas. En las familias de los altos ejecutivos de las empresas tecnológicas del valle se está generalizando la práctica de exigir a las niñeras que firmen “contratos sin móvil” .
“Yo he trabajado en casas en las que tenía que dejar el móvil en la garita de seguridad cada vez que entraba”, explica Janie Martinez , que lleva 15 años como niñera en la zona. “No podía mirar el teléfono en toda mi jornada de trabajo, y los niños no podían ver pantallas durante el tiempo que estaban conmigo. Es una locura”.
Martinez ha trabajado en familias de “perfil muy alto” del mundo de la tecnología, incluida la de Mark Zuckerberg , fundador de Facebook, asegura. Trabajos que, en los casos más extremos, pueden estar remunerados con hasta 100.000 dólares anuales. “Cuanto más alto ha sido el perfil de las familias, más preocupadas estaban por este tema”, cuenta . “No querían que sus hijos mirasen una pantalla y, por contrato, me impedían usar el teléfono. Eso me parece frustrante. Como cuidadoras, necesitamos el móvil para una emergencia. No solo para que nos localicen los padres de los niños, también para nuestras propias familias”.
Syma Latif, directora de la agencia de niñeras Bay Area Sitters, que coloca a dos centenares de cuidadoras en la zona de Silicon Valley, confirma esta tendencia. “Cada vez vemos más familias que incluyen estas estipulaciones en los contratos, es sin duda algo muy común”, asegura. “Cuando hablamos de tiempo de pantalla y niñeras, hay dos aspectos a tratar: su propio tiempo de pantalla y el del niño. Los contratos típicamente incluyen algo relacionado con los dos. Pero una cosa es que te digan: ‘Este es mi hijo y solo se le permite tiempo de pantalla a determinadas horas’. Eso está bien, porque trabajas para esa persona. La zona gris empieza cuando tu propio tiempo de pantalla es el que es dictado. ¿Tiene el empleador derecho a decirte que no puedes estar al teléfono? ¿Qué pasa si tienes un hijo en el colegio y necesitas acceso al teléfono por si te tienen que localizar, o un padre o una madre en casa que necesitan ayuda?”.
Algunos padres van aún más allá. Se dedican a pasearse por los parques en busca de niñeras que están pendientes de sus móviles mientras cuidan de los niños de otros. Cuando creen encontrarlas, las fotografían y las denuncian en grupos de madres en Internet. Son los “espías de niñeras”. Existen páginas web como Yo Vi a Tu Niñera en las que se comparten esas fotos.
“Pasa mucho en los parques”, explica Anita Castro , con 10 años de experiencia como cuidadora en la zona. “Ni siquiera nos conocen, sacan una foto, la ponen en redes sociales y preguntan: ‘¿Es esta tu niñera?’. Pero no saben que podemos estar comunicándonos con los padres. Y tampoco si soy la niñera o una familiar. Es una invasión de la privacidad. En algunos trabajos me sentía observada. Me daba cuenta de que tenían cámaras en la casa. Y hasta los niños me vigilaban: miraba la hora y me preguntaban si estaba enviando mensajes y a quién. Así que podía saber que habían tenido esa conversación con sus padres, que les habían pedido que les dijeran si yo estaba al teléfono”.

Texto completo: La profesora, armada con tizas de colores, suma fracciones en el gran encerado, enmarcado en madera rústica, que cubre la pared frontal de la clase. Los niños de cuarto grado, de 9 y 10 años, hacen sus cuentas en los pupitres con lápiz y cuartillas. El aula está forrada de papeles: mensajes, horarios, trabajos de los alumnos. Ninguno ha salido de una impresora. Nada, ni siquiera los libros de texto, que elaboran los propios niños a mano, ha sido realizado por ordenador. No hay detalle alguno en esta clase que pudiera desentonar en los recuerdos escolares de un adulto que asistió al colegio el siglo pasado. Pero estamos en Palo Alto. El corazón de Silicon Valley. Epicentro de la economía digital. Hábitat de quienes piensan, producen y venden la tecnología que transforma la sociedad del siglo XXI.
Escuelas de medio mundo se esfuerzan por introducir ordenadores, tabletas, pizarras interactivas y otros prodigios tecnológicos . Pero aquí, en el Waldorf of Peninsula, colegio privado donde se educan los hijos de directivos de Apple, Google y otros gigantes tecnológicos que rodean a esta antigua granja en la bahía de San Francisco, no entra una pantalla hasta que llegan a secundaria .
“No creemos en la caja negra, esa idea de que metes algo en una máquina y sale un resultado sin que se comprenda lo que pasa dentro. Si haces un círculo perfecto con un ordenador, pierdes al ser humano tratando de lograr esa perfección. Lo que detona el aprendizaje es la emoción, y son los humanos los que producen esa emoción, no las máquinas. La creatividad es algo esencialmente humano. Si le pones una pantalla a un niño pequeño limitas sus habilidades motoras, su tendencia a expandirse, su capacidad de concentración. No hay muchas certezas en todo esto. Tendremos las respuestas en 15 años, cuando estos niños sean adultos. ¿Pero queremos asumir el riesgo?”, se pregunta Pierre Laurent, padre de tres hijos, ingeniero informático que trabajó en Microsoft, Intel y diversas startups, y ahora preside el patronato del colegio.
Sus palabras ilustran lo que empieza a ser un consenso entre las élites de Silicon Valley. Los adultos que mejor comprenden la tecnología de los móviles y las aplicaciones quieren a sus hijos lejos de ella. Los beneficios de las pantallas en la educación temprana son limitados, sostienen, mientras que el riesgo de adicción es alto.
Los pioneros lo tuvieron claro desde muy pronto. Bill Gates, creador de Microsoft, limitó el tiempo de pantalla de sus hijos. “No tenemos los teléfonos en la mesa cuando estamos comiendo y no les dimos móviles hasta que cumplieron los 14 años”, dijo en 2017. “En casa limitamos el uso de tecnología a nuestros hijos”, explicó Steve Jobs, creador de Apple, en una entrevista en The New York Times en 2010, en la que aseguró que prohibía a sus vástagos utilizar su recién creado iPad. “En la escala entre los caramelos y el crack, esto está más cerca del crack”, apuntaba también en The New York Times Chris Anderson, exdirector de la revista Wired, biblia de la cultura digital.
Laurent, que no le dio un móvil a su hijo pequeño hasta noveno grado (14 o 15 años), alerta de un peligroso cambio en el modelo de negocio del que ha sido testigo en su vida profesional. “Cualquiera que hace una aplicación quiere que sea fácil de usar”, explica. “Eso es así desde el principio. Pero antes queríamos que el usuario estuviera contento para que comprase el producto. Ahora, con los smartphones y las tabletas, el modelo de negocio es otro: el producto es gratis, pero se recogen datos y se ponen anuncios. Por eso, el objetivo hoy es que el usuario pase más tiempo en la aplicación, para poder recoger más datos o poner más anuncios. Es decir, la razón de ser de la aplicación es que el usuario pase el mayor tiempo posible ante la pantalla. Están diseñadas para eso”.
El problema de la relación de los niños y la tecnología es que el ritmo vertiginoso al que se transforma dificulta la reflexión y el estudio. Una investigación de Common Sense Media, organización sin ánimo de lucro “dedicada a ayudar a los niños a desarrollarse en un mundo de medios y tecnología”, da una idea de la velocidad de los cambios: los niños estadounidenses de cero a ocho años pasaban en 2017 una media de 48 minutos al día ante el móvil, tres veces más que en 2013 y 10 veces más que en 2011. “¿Cuándo empezó todo este furor por los teléfonos inteligentes?”, se pregunta María Álvarez, vicepresidenta de la organización. “No tiene más que 12 o 13 años.

Texto completo: And now comes the reckoning for the mainstream news media and the pundits.
After more than two years of intense reporting and endless talking-head speculation about possible collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russian agents in 2016, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III put a huge spike in all of it on Sunday. Attorney General William P. Barr relayed Mueller's key findings in a four-page summary of the 22-month investigation: The evidence was insufficient to conclude that Trump or his associates conspired with Russians to interfere in the campaign.
Barr's announcement was a thunderclap to mainstream news outlets and the cadre of mostly liberal-leaning commentators who have spent months emphasizing the possible-collusion narrative in opinion columns and cable TV panel discussions.
"Nobody wants to hear this, but news that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is headed home without issuing new charges is a death-blow for the reputation of the American news media," Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi wrote in a column published Saturday, a day before Barr nailed the collusion coffin shut. He added: "Nothing Trump is accused of from now on by the press will be believed by huge chunks of the population."
Taibbi wrote that the reporting and commentary asserting collusion between Trump and Russia belonged in the dustbin of other discarded stories, such as Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction before the U.S. invasion in 2003. He even called out "Saturday Night Live" - one of Trump's favorite Twitter foils - for a cast singalong to Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" that featured the line: "Mueller, please come through, because the only option is a coup."
Journalist and commentator Glenn Greenwald - a longtime skeptic of the collusion angle - tweeted his contempt for the media coverage on Sunday, too: "Check every MSNBC personality, CNN law 'expert,' liberal-centrist outlets and #Resistance scam artist and see if you see even an iota of self-reflection, humility or admission of massive error."
He added: "While standard liberal outlets obediently said whatever they were told by the CIA & FBI, many reporters at right-wing media outlets which are routinely mocked by super-smart liberals as primitive & propagandistic did relentlessly great digging & reporting."
Greenwald reserved special vitriol for MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.
An MSNBC representative declined to comment Sunday; CNN's representatives did not respond.
Among the theories commentators advanced was one by New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait, who speculated in a cover story in July about whether "the dark crevices of the Russia scandal run not just a little deeper but a lot deeper." He suggested that "it would be dangerous not to consider the possibility that the [then-upcoming] summit [between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin] is less a negotiation between two heads of state than a meeting between a Russian-intelligence asset and his handler."
In a statement Sunday night, Chait stood by his article. "That story relied on reports in credible public sources. None of those reports have been refuted. . . . If the full Mueller report does show that media reports on Trump's ties to Russia were wrong, I would absolutely amend, correct or withdraw commentary I have written on that basis."
Other news outlets defended their reporting as well, noting that much of it is undisputed and has led to indictments and guilty pleas by figures associated with Trump's campaign.
"I'm comfortable with our coverage," said Dean Baquet, the New York Times's top editor. "It is never our job to determine illegality, but to expose the actions of people in power. And that's what we and others have done and will continue to do."
He noted that Barr's letter points out that the actions that warranted an obstruction inquiry were "the subject of public reporting" - a fact "that's to the credit of the media."
In fact, revelations by the Times and The Washington Post about contacts between Russian agents and Trump's campaign advisers in 2016 helped prompt the inquiry that the special counsel took over in May 2017. The two newspapers shared a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on the issue that year.
As Baquet noted Sunday, "On Russia interference, we and others wrote extensively about Russia's attempt to influence the election, both through hacking and direct approaches by Russians to people around candidate Trump. Those stories were true. And nothing has happened to call into question the reporting about Donald Trump's financial history, or the use of his charity, or any of the other fine investigative reporting over the past three years."
"Russiagate" has been a news media obsession since Trump's victory in November 2016. The nonpartisan Tyndall Report pegged the total amount of time devoted to the story on the evening newscasts of ABC, CBS and NBC last year at 332 minutes, making it the second-most covered story after the Senate confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. According to a count by the Republican National Committee released Sunday, The Post, the New York Times, CNN.com and MSNBC.com have written a combined 8,507 articles mentioning the special counsel's investigation.
The cable news networks, particularly CNN and MSNBC, have added hundreds of hours of discussion about the topic, too.
The story undoubtedly was an important factor in shaping voters' perceptions before the 2018 midterm election, in which Democrats won control of the House.
But the conclusion of the inquiry has put a question once hazily debated into sharp focus: Did the mainstream news media mislead?
"Liberal journalists expected Mueller to build a case for scandalous collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government," said Tim Graham, director of media analysis for the conservative Media Research Center. Noting Mueller's broad findings, he said, "So now it's apparent the news channels merely channeled their wishful thinking. They had a grand denouement in mind, and it didn't happen. They mocked Trump for saying 'no collusion,' and that ended up being the truth. . . . The voters should feel punked, swindled."

Texto completo: Katie Arnold loves life and that love is linked to her passion for running. Arnold became an ultrarunner, meaning she challenges herself with distances sometimes twice the 26.2 miles of a marathon.
She had been running and still runs shorter distances.
Hours before a recent phone interview, Arnold, a Santa Fe resident, just returned from a 12-mile run that she called “a celebration.” It was her way to celebrate the publication of her perceptive, dynamic memoir “Running Home.”
“Running is a form of expression. I feel strong. I feel connected to the world, connected to myself. Running has always been a personal experience for me on so many levels,” Arnold said.
Her ultrarunning grew out of death and birth. She explains the path that led her through the mourning and grief after the death of her father, former National Geographic photographer David Arnold, from late-stage kidney cancer. Her writing draws out the reader's sympathy and, at other moments, tears.
In one passage, she writes with hopefulness about the Thanksgiving less than a month before her father passed: “… we hold out a tatter of optimism that he will miraculously rouse himself and eat with us. But he stays in bed, listening to Brahms' Requiem on the CD player and slipping in and out of sleep, while we clatter around the dining room, hoping our forced cheer will drift up through the ceiling …”
Two paragraphs later, she effortlessly shifts gears, from the grayness of impending death to the brightness of a new-born daughter: “The moment Pippa was born, I knew I'd given birth to a wild animal. … She was a ball of kinetic power, barely contained in a 7-pound body. She had the face of an organ-grinder monkey, the oblong belly of a tree frog, and the limbs of a baby wolverine, taut and wiry, ready to spring.”
Then there is the power that propelled her to write about mourning and grief.
“Writing the book had an energy all its own. Early on, it felt it was coming out of me. My job was to get it down, and get it out into the world,” she said. “Ideas would come to me when I ran and I would write them in my notebook.”
Arnold remembers being in survival mode in the first year after her father's death. The next year she returned to running. She said she was “running her way through the grief.” In the following year emerged a pattern of self-discovery and a discovery of the man her father was.
“My hope with the book is to reach or touch people who are not runners but who maybe lost someone or lost some of themselves,” Arnold explained.
She isn't urging everyone to use running to get through grief. Rather, Arnold said, “follow the voice inside you to guide you and you will come out stronger on the other side … For me the process of training and running was not the end result. It's a progression … not the destination.”
She encourages people to trust their inner energy to go places they hadn't imagined, especially if they're in a dark place. “And don't think in terms of heroic, epic distances but instead keep doing the thing that moves you,” she said.
Arnold is a contributing editor and the former managing editor at Outside magazine, where she has worked for 24 years, starting as an intern. She has also written for the New York Times, Sunset, Runner's World, Elle and many other publications.

Texto completo: Of 895 slots in the freshman class of Stuyvesant High in New York City, seven were offered this year to black students, down from 10 last year and 13 the year before.
In the freshman class of 803 at The Bronx High School of Science, 12 students are black, down from last year's 25.
Of 303 students admitted to Staten Island Technical High School, one is African-American.
According to The New York Times, similar patterns of admission apply at the other five most elite high schools in the city.
Whites and Asians are 30 percent of middle school students, but 83 percent of the freshman at Bronx High School of Science, 88 percent at Staten Island Technical and 90 percent at Stuyvesant.
What do these numbers tell us?
They reveal the racial composition of the cohort of scientists and technicians who will lead America in the 21st century.
They identify a fault line that runs through the Democratic Party, separating leftists who believe in equality of results for all races and ethnic groups, and those who believe in a meritocracy.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has expressed anger and frustration at the under-representation of blacks and Hispanics in the elite schools. But Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature have ignored his pleas to change the way students are admitted.
Currently, the same test, of English and math, is given to middle school applicants. And admission to the elite eight is offered to those who get the highest scores. Moreover, Asians, not whites, are predominant.
Though 15 percent of all middle school students, Asians make up two-thirds of the student body at Stuyvesant, with 80 times as many slots as their African-American classmates. The egalitarian wing of the Democratic Party sees this as inherently unjust. And what gives this issue national import are these factors:
First, the recent scandal where rich parents paid huge bribes to criminal consultants to get their kids into elite colleges has caused a wave of populist resentment.
Second, Harvard is being sued for systemic reverse racism, as black and Hispanic students are admitted with test scores hundreds of points below those that would disqualify Asians and whites.
Third, Joe Biden has a history on compulsory integration dating to the 1970s that Sen. Jesse Helms called "enlightened." Here are Biden's quotes, unearthed by The Washington Post, that reflect his beliefs about forced busing for racial balance in public schools:
"The new integration plans being offered are really just quota systems to assure a certain number of blacks, Chicanos, or whatever in each school. That, to me, is the most racist concept you can come up with.
"What it says is, 'In order for your child with curly black hair, brown eyes, and dark skin to be able to learn anything, he needs to sit next to my blond-haired, blue-eyed son.' That's racist!
"Who the hell do we think we are, that the only way a black man or woman can learn is if they rub shoulders with my white child?
"I am philosophically opposed to quota systems. They insure mediocrity."
That was 44 years ago. While those views were the thinking of many Democrats, and perhaps of most Americans, in the mid-'70s, they will be problematic in the 2020 primaries.
Biden knows that just as Bernie Sanders fell short in crucial South Carolina because of a lack of support among black voters, he, too, has a problem with that most loyal element in the Democratic coalition.
In 1991, Biden failed to rise to the defense of Anita Hill when she charged future Justice Clarence Thomas with sexual harassment. In the Senate Judiciary Committee, he was a law-and-order champion responsible for tough anti-crime legislation that is now regarded as discriminatory. How, with a record like this, does Biden inoculate himself against attacks by rival candidates in his run for the nomination?
One way would be to signal to his party that he has grown, he has changed, and his 2020 running mate will be a person of color. Perhaps he'll run with a woman of color such as Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the 2018 governor's race in Georgia.
An ancillary benefit would be that Abrams on the ticket would help him carry Georgia, a state Donald Trump probably cannot lose and win re-election.

Texto completo: A Metropolitan Opera production airs on PBS. And Alejandro G. Iñárritu's "The Revenant" brings operatic intensity to FXM.
What's on TV
GREAT PERFORMANCES AT THE MET: SAMSON ET DALILA 12 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The star singers Elina Garanca and Roberto Alagna lead this Metropolitan Opera production of Saint-Saëns's biblical work, staged last year with old-fashioned extravagance by the director Darko Tresnjak ("A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder"). The adaptation, in which Garanca plays Dalila to Alagna's Samson, retells the Old Testament tale of a doomed love affair set in Gaza, with enslaved Israelites suffering under the oppression of the Philistines. The high emotional stakes of the story can make for grand spectacle. But, in his review of this production for The New York Times last year, Anthony Tommasini wrote that Tresnjak's staging "somehow managed to be both gaudy and dull." Still, it's not every Sunday that you can catch a filmed performance from one of the world's great opera houses for free from the comfort of your couch.
THE REVENANT (2015) 7:45 p.m. on FXM. Alejandro G. Iñárritu aspires to operatic intensity in this rugged revenge story. Fresh off his Oscar win for directing the midtown Manhattan-set "Birdman" the year before, Iñárritu here went deep into the wilderness and back to the 1820s, casting Leonardo DiCaprio as a quintessential American mountain man, Hugh Glass. After being left for dead on a fur expedition by a cruel companion (Tom Hardy), Glass plods through expansively (and expensively) shot, drop-dead-gorgeous snowy landscapes, bent on revenge. His journey involves intricately choreographed action, a wrestle with a bear and an extremely committed performance from DiCaprio. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie "an American foundation story, by turns soaring and overblown."
AMERICAN INJUSTICE: A BET TOWN HALL 9 p.m. on BET. This hour long special assembles members of the Congressional Black Caucus -- including the senators and presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Cory Booker -- as well as political organizers and other lawmakers for a discussion about criminal justice reform. The recently-approved First Step Act is one of the topics discussed, as are potential solutions to racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Soledad O'Brien hosts.
What's Streaming
GOLDEN EXITS (2018) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon and iTunes. In a quiet corner of Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, the arrival of a young, beautiful Australian, Naomi (Emily Browning), tests the relationships among two groups of complicated, prickly people. It's a small-scale premise for this intimate and at times claustrophobic movie, written and directed by Alex Ross Perry (Manohla Dargis called Perry a "virtuoso of unease" in her review of the film for The Times). Adam Horovitz, Chloë Sevigny, Mary-Louise Parker and Jason Schwartzman play the Brooklynites.
THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY (2005) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Douglas Adams's cult interstellar farce comes alive in this vivid adaptation. Martin Freeman stars as Arthur Dent, an English Everyman who survives the destruction of Earth thanks to his alien friend, Ford Prefect (Mos Def). It's some of the most distinctly British humor you'll find this side of MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL (1975), which also happens to be streaming on Netflix.

Texto completo: The house did not immediately grab Harlan Coben by the lapels.
It was, to tick off the liabilities, situated on one of the main drags in Ridgewood, N.J. Locally, it was a well-known pile of Second Empire gingerbread, with pink trim and a mansard roof. People would drive by and gawk. Sometimes, they would park down the street and, affecting a casual air, take a nice, slow walk past the property for a closer look. And with three floors and nine bedrooms, it was a lot of house.
Perhaps most problematic, it was a touch too on-the-nose for the best-selling author of a few dozen thrillers to live in a spooky Victorian manse. "It's the kind of cliché I try to avoid when I write," said Mr. Coben, whose latest work, "Run Away," the story of a Manhattan money manager's desperate attempts to save his renegade drug-addict daughter, is out this week.
This not being a mystery by the master himself, there is no imperative to keep readers in suspense.
Just over 20 years ago, Mr. Coben and his wife, Anne Armstrong-Coben, a pediatrician, were living across town in a center-hall colonial, expecting their third child (they now have four) and looking for more space. "When the house came on the market, it seemed like a good value," he said, and so the deal was done.
"My wife and I were in agreement," Mr. Coben continued. "It wasn't like one of those home shows where they have a couple, and she wants something totally modern and he wants something old-fashioned. I watch and always wonder, 'How did you guys get married?"'
But this acquisition might have satisfied even such bickering pairs. The previous owner had preserved and protected its abundant Old World charm -- paneled walls and ceilings, wainscoting, crown molding, herringbone floors, beveled leaded-glass doors -- while showing an appreciation for modern conveniences of the Sub-Zero kind.
"The Victorian had all the structure of a great old house, but it really was homey," Mr. Coben said. "I couldn't turn it down. I sort of fell in love."
The love burns as brightly as ever, but now it has a bittersweet tinge. One by one, the children have gone out into the world. With the youngest off to college next fall, Mr. Coben and his wife will be empty nesters in a very big nest.
"But the kids like coming back to the house," he said, smiling gamely. "They all have their favorite nooks and crannies."
Of course, Mr. Coben has his favorite spots, too. The library ranks high both because it provides an ideal background for the author photos on his book jackets and because, plain and simple, it's a library. It has reading matter and lots of it, as well as treasures like a Maltese falcon statue, a tip of the hat to Dashiell Hammett, one of Mr. Coben's literary idols. ("It's kind of a cliché, but it's here.")
______
______
Harlan Coben, 57
Occupation: writer
Edifice complex: "It was hard for me to imagine living in a house this spectacular," Mr. Coben said. "I had panic attacks about living in a house this cool."
______
There is also a statue of Boston Celtics legend John Havlicek. "I loved him when I was a kid," said Mr. Coben, a native of Newark, N.J., who played on the basketball team at Amherst College.
Some of the volumes in the handsome built-in bookcases are foreign editions of the Coben oeuvre. Such display is not born of a desire to trumpet the popularity of exhortatory titles like "Hold Tight," "Play Dead" and "Tell No One" in distant ports. It is all about storage.
Storage is something of a theme for Mr. Coben, who has accumulated many items related to his work -- both priceless and worthless -- and has not the slightest idea what to do with them. Thus, plaques, posters of the film adaptations of his novels, photographs (some sent by fans) and blowup images of the New York Times best-seller list with this or that Coben novel in the top spot lean against one another in the library, just steps from the pool table.
For the record, no one in the family picks up a cue stick. Ever. The presence of the table is a puzzle best left to keener minds. Except when reporters are around and there is an attempt to tidy up, the stretch of green felt holds detritus and, when Mr. Coben is sitting in a chair nearby, his feet.
He and his wife have made a few alterations to the house over the years. They painted that pink exterior trim blue, added a bathroom, converted a broken-down greenhouse into a sunroom, outfitted the backyard with a pool and a sports court, and in the spirit of D.I.Y., installed a faux-tin ceiling in the kitchen using plastic molding and gray spray paint.
Mr. Coben has an officially designated office on the second floor. It was once the bedroom of his younger daughter, Eve, which explains the red-and-purple walls. Providing a sober contrast is the partners desk that Mr. Coben and his wife bought to celebrate their first wedding anniversary.
Actually, the office is kind of superfluous. Unlike authors who require a setting with a specific barometric pressure to write even a check, Mr. Coben can work anywhere: a coffee shop, the back of an Uber (seriously). Plot turns have presented themselves during his time on the treadmill desk in the third-floor workout room and in the sunroom, which is just off the kitchen.
"I don't need or want one particular spot," said Mr. Coben, who signed a deal last year with Netflix to turn several of his thrillers into series and movies.
He left the job of furnishing the house to his wife when they moved in two decades ago. And sometimes he may feel a twinge of regret about that decision, particularly about some of the contributions from his mother-in-law, an antiques lover who is now deceased.
"Once in a while I see something that's really ugly, and I don't know why we're keeping it, and a lot of it was from her," Mr. Coben said, hastily adding, "But I do like the player piano that came from her."
It was his mother-in-law who bought him the menagerie of animal-head walking sticks in the stand by the front door. "She thought I should have a collection of something, but I haven't collected any beyond the ones she got me," Mr. Coben said, unscrewing one of the sticks to reveal a flask, another to show the dagger tucked inside.
Just a weapon looking for a plot.

Texto completo: Poignant stories of violence and loss, perseverance and hope are depicted in photographer James A. Bowey’s exhibit, "When Home Won’t Let You Stay," on display until Sunday, May 26 at the Schaumburg Township Library, 130 S. Roselle Rd., Schaumburg. The exhibit is located on the library’s second floor.
As Bowey, a documentary artist, traveled throughout Minnesota in an exploration of America’s evolving attitudes toward refugees, he listened to refugee’s stories and photographed them in their everyday surroundings. Each was forced to leave their country in order to survive. The experiences shared by the refugees featured in "When Home Won’t Let You Stay" produce a compelling human portrait of refugees in Minnesota.
"One of the most difficult things a person ever does is to truly see another," Bowey said in his artist statement. "But if we really look at someone and consider their story, we discover the shared humanity that links us all. That is the hope for this work: to find ourselves in each other, one photograph at a time."
Bowey uses his documentary and photography skills to explore issues of human rights and social connection. He has spent his career covering a wide range of global and national stories, from the war in Bosnia to Hurricane Katrina. His photography and writing has been featured in the New York Times, Time Magazine, the Associated Press, and in numerous exhibitions.

If you had the money, would you pay off a college admissions officer? 1 in 4 parents say they would, a new poll finds

Texto completo: If you had the money, would you bribe a college official to get your child admitted?
Fifteen percent of all American adults would answer yes, according to a new poll. And that number rises to 25 percent for adults who actually have children ages 18 and under.
It’s a hypothetical question, but certainly a revealing ethical one. There’s been a flood of outrage over the recent college admissions scandal, in which federal prosecutors charged parents with everything from paying off testing proctors to lying about their child’s athletic abilities to win a spot at elite schools. But a new poll from YouGov, a global public opinion and data company, shows that a large percentage of the U.S. population certainly doesn’t rule out the possibility of cheating and bribery when it comes to college admissions.
“It speaks to the pressure of parenting a bit,” said Larry Shannon-Missal, head of data services in the U.S. for YouGov. “Parents are aware of how increasingly competitive it is out there. They’re all reading the same articles we are about kids coming out of college and moving back in with their parents because it’s hard to find jobs that will pay enough to get a living wage.”
Even more parents — 34 percent — said they would be willing to pay someone to take an entrance exam on behalf of their child to get him or her into a good college. Of the general public, 20 percent said they would do so.
Shannon-Missal said these findings might also speak to a level of cynicism among the general population: that people see the wealthy using their resources to take advantage of the higher education system and would therefore be more likely to think that they themselves should also be able to do so, if they had the resources.
About two-thirds of adults polled said they were not surprised at the cheating scandal, and a similar number said the system is rigged in favor of wealthy students. In fact, 44 percent of adults said that, if given the money, most parents would pay to get their kids ahead.
Steering students toward specific extracurricular and academic tracks designed to catch the eye of admissions officers is not uncommon and is available at sky-high prices. A recent New York Times profile of college consultants reported that costs for these services can reach into the millions of dollars. And rigorous, expensive test prep for entrance exams remains at the center of debates around equity and inclusion.
It’s worth noting that the majority of respondents said they would not cheat: About three-quarters said they would probably or definitely not pay off a high school or college official. But if they had the money, 72 percent said they would likely pay for tutoring or test prep to get their child into college.
While the two most high-profile participants accused in the scheme — celebrities Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman — are women, the survey found that more men than women were willing to cheat in the college admissions race. When it came to paying someone to take a college entrance exam for their child, 23 percent of men said they probably or definitely would, compared with 17 percent of women. And 19 percent of men said they would probably or definitely pay a college official to secure their child a spot, versus 12 percent of women.
Some survey questions asked whether the respondent would hypothetically cheat if given the resources, but when other questions inquired as to whether they have actually cheated to get themselves or their children ahead, very few said they had. Only 2 percent said they’ve paid someone to gain an advantage for their child. Only 10 percent admitted to having personally cheated on a pop quiz, and 5 percent said they’ve cheated on a final exam.
“There are a lot of things that people could see, under the right circumstances, being willing to go to an extreme (for), but that doesn’t mean that most people have found that set of circumstances that has driven them to do so,” Shannon-Missal said.
The survey is weighted and representative of U.S. adults. It was conducted online from March 13 and 14 and included 1,259 respondents. The margin of error was 2.76 percentage points.

When 'Eat Local' Goes Viral: A Detroit Restaurant's Success Saga; At Lady of the House, Kate Williams set out to open a neighborhood restaurant. Then the destination diners arrived

Texto completo: PHOTO: Bridget Barrett for The Wall Street Journal
LESS THAN a year after opening Lady of the House in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood, 33-year old chef and owner Kate Williams received the kind of attention most chefs only dream of. Food & Wine magazine named her one of the Best New Chefs of 2018. The same year, GQ dubbed Lady of the House one of its Best New Restaurants. Next came a nod from the James Beard Foundation. And that was only the beginning.
These days, many Detroiters can't get into Lady of the House. Reservations for weekends are booked several weeks in advance. Plates run from $11 to $68 (for a whole chicken)—in a city where the poverty rate is more than twice the national average. The restaurant has gone from local spot to destination.
"Now our clientele is driving from two hours away or flying in from other cities. This was totally unexpected; it was not the vision," said Ms. Williams. Now she's lucky if she gets three hours in the kitchen. "As you grow you need more infrastructure—more people to deal with the press, answer emails, deal with staff. How to grow from a leader in the kitchen and chef to a 'CEO' is very personal to me."

When I sat down with Ms. Williams at Lady of the House recently, I asked her to outline her original vision. After some musing, she replied, "I wanted to build a Detroit neighborhood restaurant that feels like it's been there forever, that will last forever."
What happens when a neighborhood restaurant suddenly gets a reputation as one of the hottest places in the country to eat? "The truth? Despite all the craziness of the past year, my expectations have not changed," Ms. Williams said. "I have always wanted to cook food I care about, be around people I care about and support my community."
Sometimes diners have other ideas. After critic Pete Wells waxed rhapsodic about Lady of the House's "carrot steak" in the New York Times, everyone wanted to order the dish. "I learned the technique when I was cooking at Restaurant Relae in Copenhagen," Ms. Williams said. "Basically you shave large carrots, salt them so they break down and roll them into a rose shape. Baste slowly with butter, thyme and garlic, and then serve it with hollandaise, and pistachios for garnish."
The carrots must be big enough to hold up to the shaving, salting and shaping. In the spring the carrots her farmer grows are too small and not sweet enough—and Ms. Williams is a farm-to-table chef who cooks with the seasons—so she takes the dish off the menu. "We also serve a chicken dish that's very popular," said Ms. Williams. "But we only work with one Amish family farm for our chickens, and in the winter they shut down production because it's too cold. Customers get so offended and disappointed when they've read about a dish and it's not available."

Erin French, chef and owner of the Lost Kitchen in tiny Freedom, Maine, deals with many of the same issues. After multiple write-ups in national publications (including this one), she now receives 20,000 reservation requests a year from people all over the world. (The restaurant is open only 9 months a year and does one seating a night for around 45 people, four nights a week.)
"I often ask myself, Where's the tipping point?" Ms. French said. "When do I start letting people down? The expectations are so high. How the hell do you make the best meal of your life four nights a week and keep thrilling people?"

Like Ms. Williams, Ms. French has mixed feelings about the press and attention—some of them positive. "I would never have pushed myself to work this hard if it weren't for everyone's expectations," she said. "Living in Freedom, Maine, population 731, and being pushed this far on a national platform... Well, I wouldn't be the cook I am today."
Back at Lady of the House in Detroit, the sun was starting to set; it was time for Ms. Williams to stop talking and get to work on the evening service. I asked if it feels different, heading into the kitchen these days, than it did when she first opened the restaurant.
"God, sometimes I'm a little jealous of other chefs in town who just get to cook all day. They're not dealing with the pressure of 'Oh, this place is supposed to be one of the best restaurants in the country,' " she said. "Sometimes it should just be about the food. Right?"

Roast Cabbage Wedges With Miso Dressing, Soy Vinaigrette and Blue Cheese
Sweet, sour and creamy with a satisfying bass note of umami, this riff on the classic iceberg wedge is a prime example of the style of cooking—familiar and surprising, comforting and inventive all at once—that's brought Lady of the House national attention. Roast cabbage wedges are served warm on top of a miso dressing, drizzled with a soy-honey vinaigrette and then sprinkled with blue cheese.
TOTAL TIME: 40 minutes SERVES: 4
For the cabbage and blue cheese:
1 medium head green cabbage
1 tablespoon kosher or sea salt
1 tablespoon sugar
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons canola oil
½ cup blue cheese such as Irish Cashel, crumbled
Flaky salt, such as Maldon
For the miso dressing:
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey
1½ tablespoons white miso
1½ teaspoons chopped fresh ginger
½ cup grapeseed oil
Salt to taste
For the soy vinaigrette:
2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1. Prepare the cabbage: Remove outer leaves and cut head into 6 wedges. (If head is particularly large, cut it into 8 wedges.) Place wedges on a baking sheet. In a small bowl, mix salt, sugar and pepper. Sprinkle mixture over cabbage and let sit 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Meanwhile make the miso dressing: In a blender or food processor, blend all ingredients until smooth and thoroughly incorporated. Add salt to taste.
3. Make the soy vinaigrette: In a small bowl whisk all ingredients together. (If honey is too cool and clumping, place jar in simmering water or microwave it for a few seconds to thin and liquefy before mixing honey into vinaigrette.)
4. Cook the cabbage: In a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet heat oil over medium-high heat. Add cabbage wedges and cook until golden-brown on all sides and softened, about 3 minutes per side. Keep warm.
5. To serve: Spoon 3 tablespoons miso dressing onto a serving platter. Top with warm cabbage and drizzle 2 tablespoons soy vinaigrette over top. Sprinkle on blue cheese and finish with flaky salt. Serve warm, with remaining miso dressing on the side.

Texto completo: JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The families were still mourning relatives lost in the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia when they were crammed into a hotel conference room a few weeks after the crash. Sign this form, they were told by employees of the low-cost carrier, and they would receive 1.3 billion rupiah, or $91,600.
For those who lost breadwinners in the crash on Oct. 29, the money, government-mandated compensation for loss of life in an aviation accident, was welcomed.
But that amount, while not insignificant for desperate families with bills to pay and children to school, was roughly the minimum they were entitled to receive under Indonesian law.
And the conditions imposed by Lion Air before it would disburse the payments were complicated and shocking, with some legal experts questioning their legality.
To collect the money, families had to sign a pledge, called a release and discharge, that they would not pursue legal action against Lion Air, its financial backers and insurers, as well as Boeing, which manufactured the nearly brand-new 737 Max 8 plane.
Moreover, the signers promised not to disclose the terms of the agreement itself, a copy reviewed by The New York Times shows.
Yet an Indonesian aviation act from 2011 specifies that when heirs receive the government-mandated payment, they do not give up their right to pursue legal action against a carrier or other entities that may have been involved in an air accident.
"The heirs of the victims have no obligation or duty to sign any requirements, including release and discharge," said Ahmad Sudiro, the dean of the law faculty at Tarumanagara University in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. "It could be that the company is trying to be tricky. This signing has no jurisdictional basis, but this is what the company is trying to force the families to do."
The document that relatives signed included an eight-page list of hundreds of other companies, many subcontractors for Boeing, which also could not be sued if relatives were to claim the money. Boeing officials declined to comment on the agreement's terms.
"This is a very unorthodox document from Lion Air," said Charles Herrmann, an American lawyer who is representing clients from the Lion Air crash and who has litigated aviation accident lawsuits for decades. "I've never seen anything like it."
Nearly five months after Flight 610 hurtled into the Java Sea, many questions remain about what caused the accident, which was followed on March 10 by the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, another nearly new Boeing Max 8, outside Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital.
Investigations have centered on whether pilots may have been foiled by an automated system designed to prevent stalls in the Max 8 that could have pitched the plane forward into a fatal nose-dive when triggered by false data.
But for the families of the 189 people who died on Flight 610, some say their grief has been exacerbated by an effort to pressure them to accept low compensation and renounce all rights to sue.
Families said they were not allowed to take home copies of the release form to study it before signing. Some said they were prohibited from bringing their own lawyers into the room to scan the paperwork, even though the form said they "had been given the opportunity to consult with a lawyer."
A Lion Air official videotaped the family members who signed the form, some of the signatories said.
"There was no time to read it carefully or check it," said Latief Nurbana, a high-ranking civil servant whose 24-year-old son was killed in the crash. "It is cruel and it is illegal."
"The amount is small," said Dedi Sukendar, a relative of one of the crash victims who said the family agreed to sign the release form so that the dead man's two children could afford to continue their schooling. "But we wanted the psychological pressure to stop."
Mr. Latief is among those who refused to sign.
The Indonesian Ministry of Transportation has sent letters to Lion Air reminding the carrier of its obligation to conform to aviation regulations. A few days ago, the ministry received a reply from Lion Air saying they would comply, transportation officials said.
Lion Air officials did not respond to questions about the form.
More than 20 relatives of those who died on Flight 610 have sued Boeing in the United States, including the family of the plane's co-pilot, Harvino, who filed a suit claiming that the plane "was defective and in a condition that rendered it unreasonably dangerous for its intended use."
Following the Ethiopian Airlines crash earlier this month, countries around the world grounded the 737 Max 8. The United States Department of Transportation has begun looking at investigating the Federal Aviation Administration's certification of the best-selling plane model.
Pilots who flew the Max 8 said they were not adequately informed about the new automated stall-prevention system, nor were they instructed how to disable it should incorrect data prompt it to seize control of the plane and propel its nose down.
"Having two horrible accidents within months of each other has put the focus in the United States on what is going on with the Max 8 and it strengthens our position on Lion Air," said Mr. Herrmann, who is also considering pursuing legal action against the Federal Aviation Administration for certifying the plane model.
Lion Air, which has amassed 15 major safety lapses in its 20-year history, including two fatal crashes, has a history of trying to use quick cash to make problems go away, according to government investigators, air safety regulators and people involved in previous accidents.
One former Indonesian transportation safety investigator said that a Lion Air employee once tried to hand over a black garbage bag full of cash when the investigator was probing the fatal crash of a Lion Air flight that overshot the runway in bad weather in 2004. When the investigator declined the bag of cash, Edward Sirait, now president director of the Lion Air Group, asked why the payment had been refused, the investigator said.
Such payments from Lion Air were common because transportation safety officials were poorly paid, former investigators said. A former high-level Lion Air employee confirmed that when he worked at the company, clandestine payments to government investigators, even for restaurants and prostitutes, were routine.
Mr. Sirait did not respond to a request for comment on the account of the plastic bag full of cash.
In an interview last year after the Flight 610 crash, he did not express condolences for the loss of life. He declined to discuss the unfolding investigation or maintenance logs detailing how the plane had recorded various data problems in the days preceding the crash.
"I am not an engineer," he said. "There are so many documents that I don't know."
Vinni Wulandari, the sister of Mr. Harvino, the co-pilot, said that since her family sued Boeing, Lion Air has refused to pay out his pension and has not honored a verbal agreement to fund his children's education. The company no longer is willing to meet with her, she said.
"They've blocked my number," Ms. Vinni said of Lion Air's senior management. "It's awful how the company treats us. We are victims, too."
Lion Air did not respond to requests for comment on her accusations.
Mr. Latief, whose son, Muhammad Luthfi Nurrandhani, was among the Lion Air 610 victims, took notice at how Tewolde GebreMariam, the chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, quickly traveled to the Flight 302 crash site and that other senior airline employees were seen comforting grieving family members.
His son, Mr. Latief said, left behind a pregnant wife, who has since given birth to a boy. In November, the family took Mr. Luthfi's remains that were recovered from the Java Sea and buried them in Jakarta.
Two months later, health officials called and said they had more remains that they had neglected to give Mr. Latief earlier. Did he want them? Mr. Latief said he did not want to upset his wife so he had a second, tiny coffin constructed and quietly buried it without telling her.
"We are humans, not animals," he said. "We deserve dignity."

Texto completo: Press
NEW YORK — Hundreds of pages of court records made public on Tuesday revealed that special counsel Robert Mueller quickly zeroed in on Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer, in the early stages of his Russia probe.
The heavily blacked-out records, released by a judge at the request of news organizations, show that Mueller had been investigating Cohen since at least July 2017 — far longer than previously known.
That was two months after Mueller was appointed to investigate possible Russian election interference and six months after Trump took office.
The full scope of Mueller’s interest in Cohen is not clear from the documents, which include search warrant applications and other records. More extensive files from the special counsel investigation remain under seal in Washington.
But the documents show that Mueller’s investigators early on began looking into possible misrepresentations Cohen made to banks to shore up his financially troubled taxi business.
They also initially were interested in money that was flowing into Cohen’s bank accounts from consulting contracts he signed after Trump got elected. Prosecutors were looking into whether Cohen failed to register as a foreign agent.
Some of the payments he received were from companies with strong foreign ties, including a Korean aerospace company, a bank in Kazakhstan and an investment firm affiliated with a Russian billionaire.
By February 2018, though, the records show Mueller had handed off portions of his investigation to federal prosecutors in Manhattan. And by the spring of 2018, those prosecutors had expanded their investigation to include payments Cohen made to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels and a Playboy centerfold, both of whom claimed to have had affairs with Trump.
The newly released documents indicate authorities continue to probe campaign violations connected to those hush money payments. Nearly 20 pages related to that matter were blacked out at the direction of a judge who said he wanted to protect an ongoing investigation by New York prosecutors.
Where that investigation is headed is unclear. But prosecutors have said Trump himself directed Cohen to arrange the hush money. The president has denied wrongdoing.
Cohen ultimately pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations over those payments. He also pleaded guilty to tax evasion, making false statements to banks and lying to Congress about Trump’s plans to build a skyscraper in Moscow. He was not charged with failing to register as a foreign agent.
He is scheduled to begin serving a three-year prison sentence in May.
Lanny Davis, an attorney for Cohen, said Tuesday that the release of the search warrants “furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump Organization to law enforcement and Congress.”
The FBI raided Cohen’s Manhattan home and office last April — the first public sign of a criminal investigation that has proved an embarrassment for Trump.
The newly released records show that nearly a year earlier, in July 2017, Mueller’s office got a judge to grant him authority to read 18 months’ worth of Cohen’s emails.
In their investigation, Mueller’s prosecutors also obtained Cohen’s telephone records and went so far as to use a high-tech tool known as a Stingray or Triggerfish to pinpoint the location of his cellphones.
FBI agents also scoured Cohen’s hotel room and safe deposit box and seized more than 4 million electronic and paper files, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives and laptops.
Both Cohen and Trump cried foul at the time over the raids, with Cohen’s attorney calling them “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and the president taking to Twitter to declare that “Attorney-client privilege is dead!”
A court-ordered review ultimately found only a fraction of the seized material to be privileged.
Tuesday’s release of documents came nearly six weeks after U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III partially granted a request by several media organizations, including The Press, that the search warrant be made public because of the high public interest in the case.
But he ordered certain material withheld, acknowledging prosecutors’ concerns that a wholesale release of the documents “would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties.”
“The unsealed records provide significant insight into the investigations of Michael Cohen and serve as an important safeguard for public accountability,” AP’s director of media relations, Lauren Easton, said Tuesday.
David E. McCraw, vice president and deputy general counsel for The New York Times, which initiated the request for the documents, said he is hopeful Pauley will approve the release of additional materials in May after the government updates the judge on its investigation.

Texto completo: CLEVELAND, Ohio - Former first lady Michelle Obama, the nation's first Black first lady, spoke to a sold-out but jubilant crowd at Cleveland's Playhouse Square on Saturday March 16, a visit that came as part of her international book tour for her new memoir titled "Becoming: An Intimate Conversation with Michelle Obama," which is already a New York Times Best Seller.
Tickets prices began at $89.50, and the show took little time selling out.
The highly anticipated book tour, a tour of select cities in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, heads next to Portland, Oregon on March 19, and then, on March 21, to Vancouver,. Canada, a solid tour schedule with more than 21 stops in April alone, including Paris, France and the Netherlands.
Moderated by ABC's "The Chew" host Carla Hall, who is Black, Michelle Obama stepped onto the stage Saturday evening at Cleveland's Playhouse Square, which she described as a 'beautiful theatre,' and said "Hey Cleveland," the crowd going wild.
The Cleveland audience was largely White, and majority female, but women and men across racial lines were there, and Michelle Obama did not hesitate in talking about what it means to be a Black woman, and the wife of a United States president, among a host of other issues.
Her 400 pages plus memoir that critics say appeals to women across the board, and empowers them, drew women in droves to Cleveland's event.
"We feel so blessed to be here," said Sherell Harris Perkins Taylor, a 30-some-thing Black woman. "She [Michelle Obama] is so amazing."
Hall was a keen moderator, and she and Michelle Obama had obvious stage chemistry, two stong and successful Black women at the helm of a progressive audience anxious for entertainment.
Hall asked Michelle Obama "what's going on?" and the former first lady responded, "girl, I'm sitting down talking with you."
Hall said the former first lady looked amazing and asked "what are you wearing?" Michelle Obama responding that her dress was designed by a talented African -American female designer.
Hall complimented Michelle Obama, saying she used her voice and her fashion as first lady to "put new designer's on the map."
A scholar and a trendsetter, Michelle Obama said that in general Americans cared more about what she wore as first lady and how she wore it than her Ivy League background, revealing that while much has changed for women in America, much has not.
She called famed designer Oscar de le Renta, who is purportedly seriously ill, "a close friend."
She and Hall touched on major aspects of the book, including Michelle Obama's humble upbringings on the largely Black South Side of Chicago, her years in the White House with her husband, former president Barack Obama, a Democrat and the nation's first Black president, and politics, work, and motherhood.
Raised by her blue collar parents on the South Side of Chicago, along with her older brother, Craig Robinson, a successful college basketball coach, Michelle Obama said the American dream is in reach to other Americans as well, and that dreams do come true.
"There are millions of Craig and Michelle Robinson's," she said.
A Princeton University undergraduate and Harvard Law School graduate who met the former president, who is four years older, in their younger years before he became famous, and as his boss when he was an attorney at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin, she said women can achieve their goals, though they must expect obstacles.
She was gracious, and at the end of the program she thanked those in attendance for support of her book tour.
An active and likable first lady whose approval ratings reveal the love and respect she has garnered from the American public since stepping into the White House with President Obama in 2009, Michelle Obama stood by her husband's side, and helped him become president.
She campaigned for then U.S. senator Barack Obama, a former Illinois state senator and community organizer on Chicago's south side, throughout 2007 and 2008, delivering a keynote address at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.
And she rallied for President Obama relative to his reelection bid in 2012, and spoke at the Democratic National Convention that year.

Race facility construction on track; Stronach sees Laurel Park as possible home for the Preakness

Texto completo: Construction of a super track in Laurel could begin this October, with work on a "world-class" Bowie Training Center following, representatives for The Stronach Group told the Bowie City Council Monday evening.
Attorney Michael Johansen said if the funding legislation they're lobbying for in the General Assembly is successful, they could start construction inside the clubhouse at Laurel after the Maryland Million race on Oct. 19. They have not applied for permits yet, he emphasized, and would still need to go through that process.
Stronach is readying Laurel Park as a possible new home for the Preakness, the second leg of horse racing's Triple Crown which is held at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. But first they would need the legislature's approval to move the Preakness to Laurel Park. Under state law it can be moved only in case of emergency or disaster.
The company, which owns the Maryland Jockey Club, wants to make $80 million in improvements to Laurel Park so it can be a year-round racing destination. It also wants to make $40 million in improvements to bring training back to the former Bowie Race Track, which closed as a track in 1985 and as a training center in 2015. Those desires are at conflict with a proposal to tear down and rebuild the Pimlico Race Course. The Maryland Stadium Authority said in a study that plans to rebuild Pimlico would cost $424 million.
Stronach said they would pay for half of the Bowie and Laurel projects, and want to use racetrack renewal funds that are set aside from casino profits to cover the other half.
While Johansen said the renewal money comes in at about $8 million a year, the legislation they support would allow the Maryland Economic Development Corporation to access the Racetrack Facility Renewal Account and issue bonds for the projects.
Officials in Baltimore have been fighting to keep the Preakness. Baltimore's state senate delegation sent a letter to the Budget and Taxation Committee last Friday asking the group to either kill the funding bill, or make an amendment that would require a planned-unit development be presented to the Board of Public Works for the Pimlico site before any bonds for Laurel would be issued. On Tuesday, Baltimore County legislators announced that they are working on a letter to support their counterparts in the city.
Legislation is also being considered that would add the Bowie property to the list of tracks that can benefit from casino revenue. It was not included on the list when Maryland first approved casino gambling in 2008, and as such, is ineligible for renewal funds.
The bill could still provide Bowie with racetrack renewal funding, even if the MEDCO bill fails.
While the ultimate fate of those properties remains undecided, awaiting the decisions of lawmakers in Annapolis, the representatives assured the Bowie City Council Monday night that they would be communicative and responsive to concerns from neighbors. After Monday's meeting Bowie resident and neighbor to Bowie Race Track Melanie Bollinger shared concerns about tractor-trailers being stored on the site, which she called an eyesore; Sinatra said the arrangement with Ryder trucks is temporary.
Another neighbor, Audrey Cunningham from Saddlebrook, grew up next to the track and is looking forward to the return of horse training there.
The council and Stronach both mentioned Bowie's historic connection to horse racing. The track there opened in 1914, and a horse and horseshoe are included on the town's seal.
A concept design for the Bowie property shows the majority of stalls remaining on the west side of Route 197, as well as a possible dormitory. Other buildings to support equine health with technology like walk-in pools could be added, they said - the plans are far from final. A synthetic track inside a dirt track at Bowie is another possibility, Sinatra said.
Synthetic tracks are kind to horses, he said, referencing recent horse breakdowns. The New York Times reported this month that 22 horses have died at the Stronach-owned Santa Anita Park in California since December, most recently a horse named Princess Lili B, who broke both legs and was euthanized. Stronach has inspected the track and said in a letter March 14 that in response to the deaths it was banning the use of race-day medication and asserting that riding crops should only be used as a corrective safety measure.
Bowie Mayor Fred Robinson said he was supportive of the legislation being considered in the General Assembly. He also told the representatives that they had set their own standard by pitching a "world-class" training center in Bowie. The city is going to hold them to it, he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia authorized a secret campaign to silence dissenters - which included the surveillance, kidnapping, detention and torture of Saudi citizens - more than a year before the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, according to U.S. officials who have read classified intelligence reports about the campaign.
At least some of the clandestine missions were carried out by members of the same team that killed and dismembered Khashoggi in Istanbul in October, suggesting that his killing was a particularly egregious part of a wider campaign to silence Saudi dissidents, according to the officials and associates of some of the Saudi victims.
Members of the team that killed Khashoggi, which U.S. officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group, were involved in at least a dozen operations starting in 2017, the officials said.
Some of the operations involved forcibly repatriating Saudis from other Arab countries and detaining and abusing prisoners in palaces belonging to the crown prince and his father, King Salman, the officials and associates said.
One of the Saudis detained by the group, a university lecturer in linguistics who wrote a blog about women in Saudi Arabia, tried to kill herself last year after being subjected to psychological torture, according to U.S. intelligence reports and others briefed on her situation.
The rapid intervention team had been so busy that last June its leader asked a top adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed whether the crown prince would give the team bonuses for Eid al-Fitr, the holiday marking the end of Ramadan, according to U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence reports.
Details about the operations come from U.S. officials who have read classified intelligence assessments about the Saudi campaign, as well as from Saudis with direct knowledge of some of the operations. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions from disclosing classified information or, in the case of the Saudis, from angering the Saudi government.
A spokesman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington said the kingdom "takes any allegations of ill treatment of defendants awaiting trial or prisoners serving their sentences very seriously."
Saudi laws prohibit torture and hold accountable those involved in such abuses of power, the spokesman said, and judges cannot accept confessions obtained under duress. The kingdom's public prosecutor and the Saudi Human Rights Commission are investigating "recent allegations," he said.
Saudi Arabia has a history of going after dissidents and other Saudi citizens abroad, but the crackdown escalated sharply after Mohammed bin Salman was elevated to crown prince in 2017, a period when he was moving quickly to consolidate power. He pushed aside Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who oversaw the security services, giving the young prince sway over the intelligence agencies.
Since then, Saudi security forces have detained dozens of clerics, intellectuals and activists who were perceived to pose a threat, as well as people who had posted critical or sarcastic comments about the government on Twitter.

Texto completo: The NCAA men’s basketball tourney starting this week will inspire 47 million Americans to wager $8.5 billion, Bill Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, proclaims during a Monday conference call with the media.
More money will change hands during a few weeks of the tournament than the total value of goods produced and services provided in the nation of Haiti during an entire year. Nearly twice as many people bet on the tournament known as March Madness as they do on the Super Bowl.
"Americans like to bet on sports, and Americans do bet on sports," Miller says, adding that a survey shows only 4.1 million of those gamblers place bets legally with casino sportsbooks in Nevada or the seven states (Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island) that legalized sports betting since last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that makes it possible.
Anyone in Illinois or those other states without legal sports booking who plunks down 5 bucks and fills out a bracket predicting the outcomes for all 68 teams in an office pool or with friends is breaking the law, although arrests are practically nonexistent.
"Most people don’t even know the activity they are participating in is illegal," Miller says. The American Gaming Association, the gambling trade group representing casinos, pushes the idea of making gambling on sports, including contests with amateur college athletes, legal in all states. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has touted the idea as a way to help raise funds in Illinois, and bills to make that happen are brewing.
"Unlike any other sporting event in the country, March Madness attracts millions who fill out brackets, make casual bets with friends or wager at a legal sportsbook, which Americans can now do more than ever before," Miller says.
I first became emotionally invested in the March Madness tournament as a kid in 1969. Having played out a simulation of the final game on my driveway hoop a hundred times, I was confident my Purdue Boilermakers and superstar shooter Rick Mount were going to vanquish a UCLA team led by center Lew Alcinder. UCLA won 92-72, Alcinder went on to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mount went on to open a hunting and fishing store in his hometown of Lebanon, Indiana, and I learned that those of us who follow our hearts instead of our heads aren’t going to do well picking winners in NCAA tournaments.
That didn’t stop me from picking an all-Hoosier Final Four whenever possible, selecting from teams such as Indiana, Purdue, Butler, Notre Dame, Indiana State and Valparaiso. That gave me a few champions (thanks, IU) in the 1980s, and some stunning upsets (thanks, Butler and Valpo), but never a complete bracket that finished in the money. When The New York Times first gave readers a chance to fill out a bracket online, my picks after Day One had me among the top 25 people in the nation. By Day Two, I had fallen out of the top 1,500.
I haven’t even bothered to fill out a bracket in recent years, which makes me a winner (or at least a non-loser).
People want to bet on March Madness, and they do it illegally if they don’t have a legal option, Miller says.
Even if Illinois legalizes sports betting through the proper channels, people might still participate in illegal office pools because it’s more fun losing money to a co-worker than to a giant gambling institution. Miller adds that the casino industry spends $300 million on "responsible gaming" programs to recognize and help people for whom gambling is a problem.
My problem with gambling today is that I did enter a free online bracket pool and my simulation has Purdue, the only team from Indiana, winning the championship game 92-72 over Michigan State.

Poll says parents hinder children's life skills

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. The survey was conducted between Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.

'Obfuscation' on emoluments issue

Texto completo: Citizens of Maryland and the District of Columbia may not know it, but the recent government shutdown created such a backlog of unfinished business that even now some of the federal priorities pertaining to them remain sidetracked. Take, for example, D.C. and Maryland v. Trump, the federal court case alleging the president has violated the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clauses.
Before its interruption, the case was at a cliffhanger. Attorneys General Brian Frosh of Maryland and Karl Racine of D.C. had a quiver of 38 subpoenas notched and ready to fly. But with the shutdown came a curiously advantageous new situation for the president. His defense could, and did, persuade the courts that since the flow of judiciary operating dollars was stoppered up, the case should be placed on ice.
On Tuesday, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit will hear oral arguments exhorting them to step in and halt D.C. and Maryland v. Trump before it can proceed. Messrs. Frosh and Racine's discovery powers, through which the president may face real legal peril, are still in check, even with the post-shutdown thaw.
Since Mr. Trump became president, his businesses have received payments and benefits from both foreign governments (China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar) and domestic ones (Maine and the U.S. General Service Administration among them). Native business operators in D.C. and Maryland say they suffer when parties hoping to curry favor with the president forsake them to instead patronize the Trump International D.C. On this basis D.C. and Maryland believe they have standing to sue.
The implicit constitutional question is whether the revenues the president receives from the likes of the GSA and UAE offend two anti-corruption provisions in our supreme law of the land. The Foreign and Domestic Emoluments clauses prohibit a president from reaping rewards of office other than his salary. They were instituted to ensure that the chief executive's loyalty to our country is uncompromised and to thwart "pay for play" politics.
We don't know what to anticipate from the Fourth Circuit. But we can expect a fresh volley of obfuscation and distraction to be fired from the sidelines: smoke and chaff calculated to deepen public perception that the emoluments issue is arcane, unknowable and not worth enforcing.
In part, this is a tactical maneuver from the right to protect Mr. Trump. But more sinister, long-term consequences attend to it as well.
James Madison insisted the Constitution must be adopted "in toto and forever." So, we should be asking ourselves if efforts to discredit one of its supposedly "obscure" components signals a campaign to soften up the whole document and render it more pliable to the powerful groups who seek to remake it in the mold of hardline ideology.
No organization has been as successful as the Federalist Society in shifting law and policy to the right. And there is a conspicuous pattern of its members penning articles in national publications that question whether the emoluments clauses apply to the president.
A favorite tactic in this mode has been to question George Washington's presidential conduct. University of South Texas Law Professor and Federalist Society member Josh M. Blackman has promoted a claim that Washington purchased federal land in 1793, in breach of the Domestic Emoluments Clause. Antonin Scalia Law School Professor Eugene Kontorovich, also a Federalist Society member, charged that Washington dealt with a British government agency when seeking new farm tenants at his Mount Vernon estate, contravening the Foreign Emoluments Clause.
Evidently the papers running such articles take them at face value. Are these law professors betting, in furtherance of designs against constitutional precedent, that the public will, too?
Examining Washington's conduct with a historian's approach - one employing primary documents - starkly erodes such claims. In Mr. Blackman's case, contracts and maps point to Washington's land deals having been made with private landowners, not the U.S. government. In Mr. Kontorovich's, little more than the copy of a charter is required to reveal that the London-based "Board of Agriculture" was in fact a private corporation with no legislative or regulatory authority. Its secretary (who delivered no tenants) had been a gushing admirer of and correspondent with Washington since before the Constitution existed.
The assertions do not hold up. Keep that in mind when the dubious experts enter the fray again as the future of D.C. and Maryland v. Trump comes into focus.

Texto completo: An 8-year-old living in a homeless shelter has won the New York State chess championship for his age bracket.
“I want to be the youngest grandmaster,” Tanitoluwa Adewumi, a Nigerian refugee who goes by Tani, told The New York Times.
Tanitoluwa placed first in the New York State Scholastic Championships tournament for kindergarten through third grade — a remarkable win for anyone.
“It’s unheard of for any kid, let alone one in a homeless shelter,” Russell Makofsky, who oversees Manhattan's P. S. 116 chess program, told USA TODAY.
Tanitoluwa hasn't had an easy life. His family left northern Nigeria in 2017 fearing attacks on Christians, The New York Times reports, and moved to New York City over a year ago where the boy learned how to play chess at school. He and his family live in a homeless shelter.
School chess coach Shawn Martinez saw Tanitoluwa's potential after observing him excel in the game a few weeks after first learning it early last year.
He reached out to Tanitoluwa's family about joining the school's chess program, and learned they were unable to pay costs associated with membership. Makofsky decided to waive Tanitoluwa's fees, which can easily exceed thousands with travel and chess camp admissions.
More: No bribes required. New Jersey teen, once homeless, accepted to 17 colleges after hard work
More: Middle school chess coach facing allegations of throwing matches, could get lifetime ban
A student gifted Tanitoluwa a chess clock. Tanitoluwa's mother took him to free regular three-hour practice sessions in Harlem. His dad lets him use a laptop to play chess online.
Seven trophies later, the elementary school boy is one of the top players in the country for his age group.
"He works very hard at his game," Martinez said, estimating Tanitoluwa could achieve master status "in the next year or two. " The world's youngest grandmaster qualified at the age of 12.
As Tanitoluwa's story hits national headlines, more people want to help.
Makofsky, who set up a GoFundMe for Tanitoluwa, said the family has received offers for a car, legal services, jobs and even housing.
"My hope is that he'll be in a home tonight," Makofsky said.

Texto completo: GARDINER — Chris Smither, songwriter, guitarist, performer and bluesman, will take the stage at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, March 29, at Johnson Hall Performing Arts Center, 280 Water St. Doors will open at 7 p.m.
“Call Me Lucky” is Smither’s new record and is his first set of new originals in six years (release date: March 2018 on Signature Sounds/Mighty Albert). Recorded at the Blue Rock Studio in the Texas foothills, the record features longtime producer and multi-instrumentalist David Goodrich, drummer Billy Conway (Morphine), Matt Lorenz (aka The Suitcase Junket), Mike Meadows, and engineer Keith Gary.
The record features Smither’s trademark songs that offer commentary on the human condition with a wink of an eye and pulls from deep in the soul.
Honing a synthesis of folk and blues for 50 years, Smither is truly an American original. Reviewers and fans from around the world, including Rolling Stone and the New York Times, agree that he continues to be a profound songwriter, a blistering guitarist and intense performer as he draws deeply from the blues, American folk music, modern poets and humanist philosophers.

Texto completo: Tras la detención de Anthony Comello como presunto responsable del homicidio del capo Francesco “Frank” Cali se indicó que el caso podría no estar relacionado con la historia criminal de la víctima.
El New York Times revela que varios oficiales indican que las indagatorias se perfilan hacia un “amor prohibido”.
Los agentes indicaron que Comello tenía interés romántico por una de las familiares del Cali , pero el jefe de la mafia le dijo al joven de 24 años de edad que se mantuviera alejado de ella. Se desconoce la identidad de la mujer.
El rechazo fue lo que, indican, desató la furia del muchacho, pero oficialmente, el jefe de detectives del Departamento de Policía, Dermot Shea , dijo que su gente estaba examinando “múltiples ángulos” del posible motivo del homicidio.
Comello fue arrestado en una casa propiedad de su familia en Brick, Nueva Jersey el sábado y está recluido en la cárcel del Condado de Ocean.
Los detectives tienen una grabación del asesinato de una cámara de seguridad afuera de la casa del Cali, y las huellas dactilares de Comello coinciden con las que se sacaron de una placa que el pistolero recogió y entregó a Cali antes de abrir fuego, según la Policía.
El hombre de 24 años de edad era graduado de Tottenville High School, vivía con sus padres en la sección de Eltingville en Staten Island, dijeron los vecinos.
“Él limpiaba la nieve por nosotros”, dijo Victor Ujeck , un vecino. “He visto a sus padres varias veces, también gente muy agradable… Nunca me hubiera imaginado que pudiera hacer esto”.
Didar Janid , de 46 años, trabaja en la bodega Campos, a pocas cuadras de la casa del sospechoso en Staten Island, dijo que había conocido al Comello desde hace casi ocho años y lo describió como alguien con personalidad “fuerte”.

Texto completo: The guest list is exclusive, though entirely predictable. To get in, you have to own a green jacket.
The green jacket.
Defending Masters champion Patrick Reed has always known who will be at the Champions dinner he gets to host next month at Augusta National, from the Golden Bear Jack Nicklaus to the likes of Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Sergio Garcia and every other Masters winner before him. But to listen to Reed talk in recent weeks about his imminent return to the beautiful Georgia golf course he tamed so memorably a year ago is to understand that he's also known for a long time what he would put on the menu, having dreamt it up as a young kid pretending every big putt he made was on Augusta's 18th green.
The 28-year-old American officially took the suspense out of his meal months ago, revealing during a tournament at Kapalua that he and fellow former champions will be dining on bone-in ribeye, macaroni and cheese, creamed spinach, and creamed corn. Pretty traditional fare for one of golf's least conventional stars, a menu it seems will please all diners (he promised to include some lighter, healthier options as well) no matter how they might feel about their host.
Yet as much as Reed has established a decidedly iconoclastic profile in a game full of individuals, somehow coming across as more of a loner than nearly everyone else on tour, his reflection on a year as Masters champ had him sounding more like the 13-year-old boy who'd long ago dreamed up that menu than any bad boy of the current game.
“I honestly can't wait for the week to start," he said in a conference call with reporters Monday.
He's been plenty busy across the last 12 months. The biggest headlines came when he took on the golf establishment, an epic post-Ryder Cup rant to the New York Times in which he ripped both teammates and captain Jim Furyk for pairings that were tailored to players' friendship desires over competitive advantage, decisions Reed believes led to the US loss and only further burnished his reputation as an outsider in the game.
But the most fun came in the times he got to travel round the world in that signature green jacket, from his first moments in it back at Butler Cabin this time last year, to a memorable courtside exchange at the world's most famous arena.
Asked his favorite memory in the jacket, Reed told a story about his young daughter.
“It would have had to have been right after we won and right after I got done talking in the press conference, right after we finished," he said. “I went back to Butler Cabin, and my daughter was there, and she just came over and gave me a big hug and told me I did it and told me she loved me. That is by far the best experience I've ever had with the green jacket. That's a memory and a moment that I'll never forget, no matter if I were to win multiple other green jackets, any other tournament I were to win, or anything like that. It's going to be hard to be able to top a moment like that that I was able to cherish with the little one."
Asked for his most interesting memory in the jacket, Reed told a story about attending a Knicks game at Madison Square Garden.
“It was on a Monday night, [my wife] Justine and I were at the Knicks game and were sitting courtside for the first time. I had Chris Rock right next to us. A couple seats down is 2 Chainz. He just kind of keeps looking down, and you can tell he's kind of looking down like, 'All right, this isn't the normal guy that sits in these seats; who is that?' And then when they announced me during one of the timeouts, then a couple minutes later there was a timeout and he just kind of reaches over, and he kind of touches the jacket, and he goes, 'So that's the real thing, huh?' I'm like, 'Yes, sir, yes, it is.' It's pretty cool to see just kind of the wide variety of people no matter what their background is, no matter what their age is or anything, how many people recognize the green jacket.
“You have little kids coming up to me whenever I wear it out, and they're just like, 'Oh, it's the green jacket.' Some of them play golf, some of them don't, and I just think it's such a cool thing how many people recognize what the green jacket is and what it actually stands for."
Asked for his least favorite memory in the jacket, Reed deferred.
“It hasn't come yet," he said. “My least favorite moment is going to be when I have to return the jacket and I'm not allowed to have it in my closet and wear it around the house and out at places. It's definitely going to give me motivation to go out and try to repeat as well as try to win multiple, because even the times I'm not actually wearing the green jacket, to be able to see the green jacket sitting in your closet or sitting in an area where you're always kind of walking by and you'll see it, it just gives you motivation and kind of picks me up and tells me that you want to keep it around. You want to keep it around as long as you can. The only way you're going to do that is continue winning at Augusta and continue winning the event so you can have it year in and year out."
No word on if he's already decided on an encore Champions Dinner menu.

Texto completo: The editor and publisher of an Alabama newspaper that suggested it's "Time for the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again" has ridden into the sunset.
Elecia Dexter, the 46-year-old African-American editor who took over the Democrat-Reporter of Linden after the Valentine's Day editorial was printed, blamed publisher Goodloe Sutton for continued interference in the paper.
Sutton, 80, said last month he was stepping away from running the small town publication due to his age. He did not address this weekend's New York Times report of his alleged continued interference. Sutton both penned and championed the KKK article.
"This is a hard one because it's sad," Dexter told the Times. "So much good could have come out of this."
She cited preservation of her own "integrity and well-being" for cutting short her tenure with the paper.
In the inflammatory piece, Sutton wrote that recently freed slaves "borrowed" their former masters' robes and horses and committed acts of terror, disguised as Klansmen. He suggested similar tactics might scare lawmakers out of raising taxes and referred to people he disagreed with as "(the) ignorant, the uneducated, and the simple-minded."
He bemoaned Democrats for being "terrible" in their reaction to the editorial and said Klan members have been "the nicest" in the aftermath of its publication. Sutton also argued to Al.Com that for years the FBI and Department of Justice are on the wrong side of the law and now, "the Klan needs to investigate them."
"That's what the point of it was," he said. "Not a lot of people understand irony today."
He also said if given a second chance, he'd run the editorial again.

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.

The privilege of wealth It's not minority kids who are taking undeserved spaces in college. It's those who got in through affirmative action for the rich.

Texto completo: When I first read about the college admissions cheating 'n' bribery scandal, my first thought was not shock that such blatant admissions-buying schemes existed, but why they bothered to break the law at all. The only surprise here is that rich people resorted to illegal means to accomplish what they could have done legally, if they'd written the fat check to the college instead of someone taking an SAT test under someone else's name. Wouldn't that have been easier - and less criminal?
What I find most outrageous about this scandal isn't the idea that rich people can buy a spot at an elite university. It's that the tactic has long existed alongside affirmative action programs, the college admissions policy that gives students from underrepresented backgrounds a boost in consideration for admission. But it's only the latter that gets criticized for allowing "undeserving" minority students to take away a seat from a more deserving white student.
The dirty open secret about college admissions is that affirmative action has always existed for the rich. Being a legacy, donating a building, endowing a chair - those are ways to guarantee additional consideration, if not an outright placement. In a 2017 study, the New York Times found that at 38 colleges and universities in the U.S., including five Ivy League schools, more students were from the top 1 percent of income than from the entire bottom 60 percent. Almost one in every four of the richest students went to an elite, highly ranked university. The Harvard Crimson last year found that the school admitted over 42 percent of students to the Class of 2022 whose families were donors. Its overall acceptance rate for applicants for that year's class? Less than 5 percent.
Strict rules govern race-based affirmative action programs in colleges; the Supreme Court has ruled that race can only be considered if the result benefits all students by creating a racially diverse college atmosphere, and race is the only way to get there. The programs have been and continue to be challenged in court.
But no such rules exist to govern how legacy admissions or donations can be considered. No rules exist to keep privilege in check.
Critics of affirmative action say the program disadvantages whites and Asians and dilutes the process by giving "their" place at college to someone who's not qualified, specifically students of color. The implication, of course, is that a minority student from a poorer background inherently doesn't deserve to be at an elite institution. But what those critics don't understand is that affirmative action, as Washington Post writer Theresa Vargas put it in a recent column, "simply broadens the definition of worth."
Who's worth a place in college? Maybe it's time to look at who's actually benefiting the most from affirmative action - and who should be.
People of color have long known the deck was stacked against them in almost every area of American life, from employment to financial security to housing. For decades, African-Americans were shut out of college, period. The college admissions scandal is just one more example of how, if you combine socioeconomic privilege and institutionalized racism, all doors are open, whether you deserve them - or even want them.
Minority students are already made to feel as though they don't belong at elite institutions. Their ability to perform, their very presence in the classroom is questioned, even though they often are the ones who have had to strive the hardest, work the longest and prove extraordinary ability before they're even considered adequate.
More than likely, students who got in through affirmative action benefited from being exposed to world-class thinkers, from making professional contacts and getting advice from mentors who could help her later in the workplace. Meanwhile, those kids whose parents cheated to get them into college would probably have been fine anywhere. But they actually did take away a spot from someone who might have benefited more.
Exactly what critics of affirmative action have complained about. But to my mind, they're complaining about the wrong group getting a leg up. In this case, the well-off got into college by paying for the advantage they possessed all along.
As the college bribery scandal just showed us, college admissions is not a meritocracy. Too often, it's actually a financial transaction at a level most of us just can't play.

Texto completo: Headnote Race and Politics
Sept. 30, 1988, 38-year old Mayor of Baltimore Kurt
Schmoke testified before the House Select Committee on Narcotics regarding the impact and efficacy of the so-called "War on Drugs." Schmoke, then a rising star in the Democratic Party, had only been on the job as mayor of Baltimore for a little over a year, inheriting a city imploded by the crack epidemic, which cut a virulent swath through the urban landscape of America.
"We can guarantee that if we continue doing what we're doing, we will fail. If we're going to have a new war on drugs, let it be led by the surgeon general, not the attorney general," said Schmoke. The former Baltimore City College High School football star, Rhodes Scholar and Baltimore City State's Attorney was advocating for the legalization of marijuana and the treatment of drug addicts as patients instead of criminals. The New York Times reported on the day of Schmoke's testimony the following:
"Instead of a drug policy based primarily on law enforcement, Mr. Schmoke proposed 'a measured and carefully implemented program of drug decriminalization,' similar to the repeal of Prohibition. $140 Billion on Illicit Drugs He conceded that there were risks in what he was suggesting.
'"Providing legal access to currently illicit substances carries with it the chance, although by no means the certainty, that the number of people using and abusing drugs will increase,'" Mayor Schmoke said. "But addiction, for all of its attendant medical, social and moral problems, is but one evil associated with drugs. Moreover, the criminalization of narcotics, cocaine and marijuana has not solved the problem of their use.""
Despite Schmoke's cogent, clear-eyed analysis of the catastrophic war on drugs, he was widely ridiculed for even suggesting a national conversation about decriminalization. In fact, three of his Maryland Democratic colleagues from the House of Representatives, Kweisi Mfume, Ben Cardin and Roy Dyson, testified against Schmoke before the House on that day. The late Marion Barry, then the mayor of neighboring Washington, D.C., a city, which had also been ravaged by drug addiction and violence, bolstered Schmoke's premise only to a point. Barry testified it was "time to rethink our policy," but he also said, "I don't know enough about the impact of cocaine addiction." A little more than a year later on Jan. 18, 1990, Barry was captured on videotape smoking crack cocaine (he was targeted in a joint sting by the FBI and D.C. Police) at the Vista International Hotel in Washington, D.C.
This was the toxic milieu in which Schmoke delivered his bold proposal; it all but destroyed the political ascendancy of perhaps the most erudite person to occupy Baltimore's mayor's chair.
But, for those of us who have been here since Schmoke's testimony before Congress more than 30 years ago, do you feel safer now or then?
In September of 1988, I had just returned to Baltimore from Los Angeles and was about 90 days from entering the doors of the AFRO for the first time in January 1989. Do I feel safer in the city now than I did then? No.
Baltimore's population in 1990 was 736,014; the homicide rate that year was 234. In 2019, the city's population is estimated at 611,648 (over 100,000 people fewer than 1990), yet, the murder rate has eclipsed 300 for the last four years in a row. I don't have to be a criminologist to discern a large percentage, if not a majority of murders in our city, are fueled by the illicit drug trade.
Recently, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby (the office that propelled Schmoke to the mayor's chair), announced her office would no longer prosecute marijuana possession cases. Foundational in Mosby's decision are the stark racial disparities in sentencing and law enforcement in such cases.
I would argue Mosby's policy shift is a good first step. But, in order to neutralize the illicit drug trade you have to take the profit out of it. To begin healing our addicted communities you have to stop treating them as criminal lepers and begin treating them as patients. Because what we are doing now regarding the drug trade isn't working for anybody save those who profit from the misery that engulfs our city.
Maybe it's time we revisit Schmoke's vision he presented more than 30 years ago. We've lost so much already; how much longer can we continue down this perilous path?

EX-COAL BARON SUES MEDIA FOR DEFAMATION

Texto completo: Former coal baron Don Blankenship is suing several news outlets and media personalities, claiming he was defamed during his failed bid for a U.S. Senate seat in West Virginia.
Mr. Blankenship's suit was filed in Mingo County, W.Va. It names The Associated Press among other large media companies. He is seeking $12 billion in damages.
Mr. Blankenship says news organizations waged a concerted plot to destroy him by erroneously labeling him as a convicted felon or saying he was imprisoned for manslaughter.
Mr. Blankenship is the former CEO of Massey Energy, which owned a mine where a 2010 explosion killed 29 workers. He spent a year in federal prison after being convicted of conspiring to break mine safety laws, a misdemeanor.
Cruz fined $35,000
Federal elections officials fined Ted Cruz's Senate campaign $35,000 for failing to report more than $1 million in bank loans he used to finance his successful long-shot race in Texas in 2012.
The penalty was part of a settlement reached by the Federal Election Commission and Mr. Cruz's Senate campaign in February and disclosed in a letter this week from the commission to the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group that had filed a complaint over the unreported loans.
The fine comes more than three years after the loans were revealed by The New York Times in January 2016 and became a political issue for Mr. Cruz during the Republican presidential primary.
Plea in pipe bomb case
A Florida man charged with sending pipe bombs to prominent critics of President Donald Trump is expected to plead guilty next week.
A notice entered in the case file of Cesar Sayoc in Manhattan federal court shows a plea hearing has been scheduled for Thursday.
Without a plea deal, Mr. Sayoc, 56, faced charges carrying a potential penalty of mandatory life in prison. It was not known which charge or charges the plea would involve.
Former officer charged
A former suburban-Atlanta police officer who was fired last year after an internal investigation found he used unnecessary force during the arrest of a former college football player has been charged with simple battery.
The Henry County district attorney's office said in an email that former county police officer David Rose was charged this week. The court document charging Mr. Rose says he "did intentionally make physical contact of an insulting and provoking nature to Desmond Marrow by grabbing him by the neck and choking him."
Mr. Rose arrested Mr. Marrow on Dec. 2, 2017, while responding to calls of a road-rage situation.
Limits on paint stripper
The Environmental Protection Agency banned consumer use of a popular but deadly paint stripper but stopped short of also banning commercial use of the product by tradespeople.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler signed the rule, which will bar manufacture and import of the stripper methylene chloride for consumer use, in a private meeting with relatives of a man who died while using the paint stripper.
The EPA cited "the acute fatalities that have resulted from exposure to the chemical" and an "unreasonable" risk to consumers. Retail stores have until later this year to remove the product from sale.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Students across a warming globe pleaded for their lives, future and planet Friday, demanding tough action on climate change.
From the South Pacific to the edge of the Arctic Circle, students in more than 100 countries walked out of classes to protest what they see as the failures by their governments.
More than 150,000 students and adults who were mobilized by word of mouth and social media protested in Europe, according to police estimates. But the initial turnout in the United States did not look quite as high.
"Borders, languages and religions do not separate us," Havana Chapman-Edwards, 8, who calls herself the tiny diplomat, told hundreds of protesters at the U.S. Capitol. "Today we are telling the truth and we do not take no for an answer."
The "school strikes" were inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, 16, who began holding solitary demonstrations outside the Swedish parliament last year.
Since then, the weekly protests have snowballed from a handful of cities to hundreds, fueled by headlines about the impact of climate change during the students' lifetime. Unless emissions of heat-trapping gases start dropping dramatically, scientists estimate that the protesters will be in their 40s and 50s, maybe even 30s, when the world will reach dangerous levels of warming that international agreements are trying to prevent.
Thunberg, who has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, said at a rally in Stockholm that the world faces an "existential crisis, the biggest crisis humanity ever has faced and still it has been ignored for decades."
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was inspired by the student climate strikers to call a special summit in September to deal with what he called "the climate emergency."
French begin work on analysis of recorders in deadly jet crash
HEJERE, Ethiopia - Analysis of the flight recorders of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines plane has begun, the airline said Friday, and The New York Times reported that the pilot requested permission "in a panicky voice" to return shortly after takeoff as the plane dipped up and down and appeared to gain startling speed.
President Donald Trump in a phone call with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed praised the state-owned airline "as a strong institution" and affirmed U.S. support after Sunday's plane crash killed 157 people, Abiy's office said.
The Times report cited "a person who reviewed air traffic communications" as saying controllers noticed the plane was moving up and down by hundreds of feet.
French authorities have said it is unclear whether data could be retrieved from the recorders.
EPA bans consumer sales of paint stripper linked to deaths
WASHINGTON - The Environmental Protection Agency is banning consumer sales of a paint stripper after personal appeals by families of men who died while using the product.
The final rule announced Friday bars the manufacture and import of consumer products containing methylene chloride.
The EPA is urging consumers not to use it.
The consumer bans begin 180 days after the rule is published. The EPA says it expects retailers to implement it sooner. The rule doesn't affect commercial uses.
California says it's tracked at least five deaths since 2014 among people overcome by the fumes from methylene chloride.
Families of victims had met with Trump administration officials and lawmakers urging the ban.
Senate to probe if DOJ officials discussed removal of Trump
WASHINGTON - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham says his panel will investigate a claim by former FBI Director Andrew McCabe that Justice Department officials once discussed using the Constitution's 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office.
McCabe has said that after former FBI Director James Comey was fired in May 2017, officials at the department, including McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, discussed bringing the Cabinet together to consider using the amendment to remove Trump. The Justice Department said in February that department leaders did not believe there was any basis for invoking the 25th Amendment.
Graham sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr.
High court expands April 23 census arguments
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court will try to resolve all the legal issues about a citizenship question on the 2020 census.
The justices Friday are expanding their April 23 arguments to include whether asking about citizenship would violate the Constitution's call for a once-a-decade count of all people, not just citizens. The court was considering whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add a citizenship question is arbitrary and capricious under federal law.
The court is hearing the Trump administration's appeal of a federal judge's ruling in New York that the decision violated federal law. A judge in California said a citizenship question also would violate the Constitution.
A final answer about a citizenship question is needed soon to allow printing of the census questionnaire.
U.S. airline cites safety in halting flights to Venezuela
FORT WORTH, Texas - American Airlines is stopping flights to Venezuela because of safety concerns after the pilots' union told its members to refuse to work the flights.
American was the last major U.S. carrier to fly to the troubled country. It flew daily to Caracas and Maracaibo from Miami.
The airline said Friday that it temporarily stopped the flights as it evaluated conditions in Venezuela, where civil unrest has increased amid opposition to President Nicolas Maduro.
The airline's decision followed a union president's order Thursday night that American Airlines pilots refuse Venezuela assignments.
United Airlines and Delta Air Lines stopped flying to Venezuela in 2017, and several foreign carriers have also pulled their flights in recent years.
Stitches for Sanders: Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign said the Vermont senator has been treated at a walk-in clinic for a minor injury while campaigning in South Carolina.
Campaign spokesman Arianna Jones told reporters that Sanders cut his head on the edge of a glass shower door Friday and went to a walk-in clinic.
She said Sanders, 77, received a half-dozen stiches and was given a "clean bill of health."
Jones said Sanders is continuing with all scheduled events, including a roundtable on health care, in South Carolina.
Sanders will travel to Nevada ahead of his first rally in the early voting state since launching his presidential bid. The rally will be held Saturday.

Texto completo: [Video: Catastrophe Season 4 - Official Trailer | Prime Video Watch on YouTube.]
Binge through the (short) final season of an irreverent romantic comedy series on Amazon. Or follow a father's painstaking search for his daughter in a thriller on Starz.
What's Streaming
CATASTROPHE on Amazon. It's the beginning of the end of this acerbic comedy series about a married couple, Rob (Rob Delaney) and Sharon (Sharon Horgan). Over the past three seasons, we've watched them awkwardly fall in love after an unplanned pregnancy, parent two children and try to stay above financial struggles. Season 4 opens after Rob's car accident puts him in a neck brace and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. That, combined with family loss, infidelity and health scares, offers plenty of comical yet achingly relatable material for the final six episodes. James Poniewozik named the show a Critic's Pick in his review for The New York Times, writing that "'Catastrophe,' it is clear, refers not to a single occurrence but to a state of being -- the chaos of life, which this comedy depicts with deadly honest charm."
TEA WITH THE DAMES (2018) stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. The formula behind this documentary by Roger Michell is pretty straightforward: Gather four renowned British actresses, set up some cameras and the rest will flow. The result is a wonderful hour-and-a-half of witty fun. The dames in question -- longtime friends Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Eileen Atkins -- swap raunchy anecdotes and reminisce about their prolific careers during a weekend in the country. (The title borrows from the 1999 biographical drama "Tea With Mussolini," which stars Smith, Dench and Plowright as artsy "Scorpionis" in prewar Florence.) We learn of their relationship troubles, their fears about acting and how frustrating it is to be patronized about one's age: When Michell asks them to discuss "getting old," Dench snaps back with an expletive that rhymes with "buzz off."
What's on TV
SEARCHING (2018) 8 p.m. on Starz. This clever psychological thriller by Aneesh Chaganty can be summed up by a hashtag created once the story gets going: #FindMargot. John Cho stars as David, a single father who takes to social media to find his teenage daughter, Margot (Michelle La), after she goes missing. His search plays out entirely on screens, as if it's the viewer who's logging onto Margot's Facebook account or calling her classmates on FaceTime. (The technique recalls the "Unfriended" movies.) As clues hint that Margot had a lot to hide, David consults with a detective (Debra Messing), but her investigation only leads to more questions.
ONE NIGHT FOR ONE DROP: IMAGINED BY CIRQUE DU SOLEIL 8 p.m. on CBS. Cirque du Soleil performs its out-of-this-world circus show -- centered on a theme of "man and nature" -- in this seventh annual fund-raising event benefiting One Drop, a nonprofit organization that focuses on safe water initiatives. Kevin Frazier of "Entertainment Tonight" and the former figure skater Tara Lipinski host, while Blue Man Group makes an appearance.

Texto completo: Headnote A WEEKEND OF JUSTICE REFORM
Philadelphia's hometown rapper Meek Mill brought his message of criminal justice reform to City Hall Thursday.
And City Council responded by honoring Mill with a proclamation designating Friday through Sunday as Meek Mill Weekend.
During a presentation ceremony before the City Council meeting, Councilman Kenyatta Johnson said Mill has "stepped up and taken his advocacy to the next level to make sure our justice system is just and fair for everyone."
The City Council resolution honored Mill for his triumphs as a chart-topping hip-hop songwriter, his philanthropic efforts and his use of his celebrity to generate awareness of inequities in the criminal justice system.
State Sen. Sharif Street, D-3, also presented Mill with a congratulatory resolution from the state Senate.
"We're acknowledging today not just a man who had personal success but a man who had personal success that never forgot where he came from," the state senator said.
Mill, who grew up in North Philadelphia, decried drug laws that overwhelmingly burden Blacks and people of color with prison sentences and criminal records.
"I don't want my son growing up in a world - a place where if he decided to use marijuana one time, he could spend two or three years in a state penitentiary raised by people he don't know," Mill said as he stood beside his 7-year-old son, Rihmeek Williams, and others.
The 31-year-old recording artist said he wants to use his platform to bring about a more equitable criminal justice system. That's why he's collaborating with hip-hop icon Jay-Z on Reform Alliance, a criminal justice reform coalition dedicated to raising funds to get people out of jail.
"This is not a call out for people to do crime and not go to jail," he said. "It's a call out to give people who actually come up under different circumstances a fair shot in America."
Mill is no stranger to those circumstances.
Mill, whose real name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, was sent to a state prison in Chester County in 2017 for minor violations of his probation conditions in a decade-old gun and drug possession case. He spent months in prison before a court ordered that he be released.
Mill's imprisonment made him a symbol for criminal justice reform activists. Celebrities weighed in on the high-profile case. Jay-Z wrote a New York Times opinion piece pointing to Mill as an example of how the criminal justice system "stalks" Black people.
Twitter users created the #FreeMeekMill movement online. And community members held rallies to call for Mill's freedom.
Michael Rubin, co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers who has supported Mill during and his court battles in recent years, said at the Thursday ceremony that Mill's experience in the criminal justice system opened his own eyes "to a world that I didn't believe existed."
"I didn't think this stuff really happened," Rubin said. "I didn't believe you could go to prison for not committing a crime."
Since his release, Mill has actively called for criminal justice reform.
He also has given back to the Philadelphia community through school supply and toy give-aways. He partnered with the city last year to renovate the basketball courts at 33rd and Oxford streets.
Mill gave a subtle shout-out to Philadelphia-based fashion designer Milan Rouge during the ceremony Thursday when he wore a gray sweatshirt with the designer's brand name written on it, Milano di Rouge. The streetwear is manufactured in the city and Los Angeles.
Mill is scheduled to perform Friday and Saturday at the Met Philadelphia.

Texto completo: I was shocked to read that Stanford University had fired head varsity sailing coach John Vandemoer in the wake of a federal investigation into shady college admissions practices nationwide. Authorities allege that Vandemoer accepted more than $600,000 in donations to the sailing program in exchange for agreeing to falsely designate two Stanford applicants as elite sailors he was recruiting for his team.
Ahoy! Stanford has a varsity sailing team?
Indeed it does. So do 16 other schools.
Why? That's a big question that looms over this entire, mortifying scandal that has resulted in charges against at least nine coaches and 33 parents accused of using various foul means to secure spots for students in elite universities.
Nothing against the physically and mentally demanding sport of sailing or those youths who have demonstrated significant aptitude for it. But why does Stanford sponsor two sailing teams, one for men and one for women?
Why does the school offer special preference in admissions to those who know how to sail? Why does it pay a coach and assistant coach to oversee their training, and send the team around the country to compete?
It can't be because the schools expect to profit off the fans of these minor sports. The number of non-sailing teens who have ever been attracted to a college or university because of its sailing team is approximately if not literally zero.
And the same is likely true of volleyball, water polo, tennis and soccer, other sports that have been implicated in the investigation.
In fact, I'm confident that non-participants aren't choosing to apply to schools because they do or don't field intercollegiate teams in golf, fencing, rowing, field hockey, wrestling, swimming, lacrosse, gymnastics, squash and other minor sports with tiny fan bases.
So why do so many schools sponsor such teams?
"By competing in college sports, student-athletes learn important skills such as leadership, time management and how to work with others toward a common goal," says the NCAA website.
That's an excellent argument for robust, highly inclusive intramural sports programs that extend these mind-body benefits to as many students as are interested.
But it's a weak argument for prolonging the tradition of devoting a disproportionate amount of often scarce resources to a narrow segment of the student body, and for reserving admission slots for those who happen to be good at otherwise generally unmarketable skills.
"The purpose of college is learning academic material, developing critical thinking and occupational skills, and teaching young men and women how to be good citizens," said Lehigh University political scientist Anthony DiMaggio. "But a sports monster has taken over our universities."
In a 2014 essay titled "Why Higher Education Should Rid Itself of College Athletics," DiMaggio wrote that "spending millions on college athletics seems like an unnecessary indulgence and a misappropriation of valuable funds" given that the vast majority of college sports programs lose money, that schools are cutting costs by hiring adjunct teachers instead of tenured professors and that students are paying ever-higher tuition rates.
This week's developments "are just a new wrinkle in an old story," DiMaggio told me Thursday. He said he'd softened his thinking a bit since he wrote the essay, and now has the view that schools should preserve any sport with a positive cash flow -- one that at least pays for itself with ticket sales, merchandising and broadcast rights.
By those standards, some schools' football and basketball programs would survive as is. They do attract students who enjoy the pageantry and spirit of the games.
Many other programs, however, would have to curtail scholarship offers and coaching salaries, and the rest would disappear (saving lots of money and, in the case of football, at least a few young brains).
But sailing, volleyball and the like would become club or intramural offerings, extracurricular opportunities along the lines of the fancy climbing walls and swank workout facilities my kids and I saw in our many college tours.
Most institutions of higher learning would come to resemble Spelman College in Atlanta, a school of some 2,500 students that eliminated team sports and dropped out of the NCAA in 2013. Administrators spent the savings on an expanded wellness program.
"All of us have to look at everything we are doing -- what's the value being added to the university and at what cost?" school President Beverly Tatum told The New York Times then.
It's a long-running scandal, on top of the current scandal, that more university presidents aren't asking themselves the same question. Maybe now they will.

We live in the same country, but in two different worlds

Texto completo: I had never heard of Bryan Stevenson.
I heard his name for the first time in Montgomery, Ala., just last month. There, on top of a hill, sits the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, the “lynching memorial," locals call it. It opened last spring. It's a somber site.
Some 800 rust-colored steel rectangles, the size and shape of coffins, bear the names of more than 4,000 African-American men, women, and children who were lynched from 1877 all the way up to 1950 simply because of the color of their skin. The monuments hang lynched, too, suspended from a ceiling. They are the history I was never taught in school.
“Jesse Thornton was lynched in Luverne, Alabama, in 1940 for addressing a white police officer without the title 'mister."' “Caleb Gadly was lynched in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in 1894 for walking behind the wife of his white employee." “John Griggs was hanged and shot . . . in 1934, after being accused of 'associating with a white woman' in Newton, Texas."
This memorial, along with the nearby Legacy Museum, was built by the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit founded in 1989 by this man I had never heard of, Bryan Stevenson.
I Googled him, watched his TED talk, read his book, “Just Mercy," and watched the documentary “13th." And then vacation was over and I flew home and what do you know? Stevenson was speaking at Symphony Hall as part of the Boston Speakers Series that very night.
I went, and the next day I talked to him and at the end of our conversation, I thought about Mother Teresa. “One by one by one," she said, that's how you save people. That's how Bryan Stevenson saves people. One by one by one.
Stevenson says lawyers saved him. Born in 1959 in southern Delaware, he grew up poor and went to a “colored" school until lawyers forced his town to adhere to federal law. He was an excellent student but didn't find his passion until he was 23, in law school, and met a man on death row. The man was his age. They talked for three hours.
“Henry altered something in my understanding of human potential, redemption, and hopefulness," Stevenson says.
It's hopefulness and a commitment to right wrongs that propel him still: A man on death row for a crime he didn't commit. A child who weighs less than 100 pounds imprisoned for life with grown men. A mentally disabled woman punished instead of being diagnosed and treated.
The United States has the highest number of men, women, and children locked up in prisons and jails in the world, Stevenson tells his audiences. In the 1970s, there were 300,000 people incarcerated. Today there are 2.3 million. More than 50 percent of prison and jail inmates have a diagnosed mental illness. The number of women increased 646 percent from 1980 through 2010.
To accommodate these millions of prisoners, a new prison was opened every 10 days from 1990 to 2005.
Prisons are big business. Many are privatized. Owners and suppliers make big money.
When he won the MacArthur Foundation “Genius Grant," Stevenson put every penny of the $300,000 prize into EJI. He's the reason the US Supreme Court ruled that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for children 17 or younger are unconstitutional. And he's the man Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Desmond Tutu has called “America's young Nelson Mandela."
So why had I not heard of him?
Because we live in the same country but we live in two different worlds.
Stevenson's work is all about bridging these worlds. “The greatest evil of American slavery was not involuntary servitude but rather the narrative of racial differences we created to legitimate slavery," he says. This narrative was embedded in our Constitution, where it was written that the census value of a slave was 60 percent the value of a free person. This narrative of diminished human value has been a theme repeated in different ways and in different words since 1788.
Stevenson's work with the poor, with prisoners, with the disenfranchised, his work with EJI, his books, his interviews, his lectures, are all about changing that narrative. “Love is the motive, but justice is the instrument." Stevenson begins “Just Mercy" with this Reinhold Niebuhr quote.
Love of man — all men, women, and children, both living and dead — and a quest for justice. These are Bryan Stevenson's superpowers.

Texto completo: One of the biggest Bay Area names implicated in the college admissions scandal is Bill McGlashan, who managed funds for one of the world's largest private equity investors.
He now is on leave from TPG Growth, an investment fund he managed for TPG Capital, a $103 billion investment fund.
TPG said McGlashan is on "indefinite administrative leave effective immediately," and co-CEO Jim Coulter is taking over as interim managing partner of TPG Growth and the Rise Fund, a global investment fund that touts itself as being just as concerned about its social impact as its returns.
The Rise Fund, which McGlashan helped form, has a star-studded lineup of board members, that include U2's Bono, Jeff Skoll and Pierre Omidyar of eBay fame, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Laurene Powell Jobs, Richard Branson and more. The New York Times wrote about the fund when it launched in 2016, saying it promised to be different.
"The problem with most of these kinds of funds is what Mr. McGlashan calls greenwashing,' a euphemism for lying, which some in philanthropy feel is rampant among socially conscious investors," it said.
McGlashan is accused of paying $50,000 to get a son into USC. According to court documents, that involved cheating on his son's ACT score. He allegedly also discussed sending a photo of his son to be Photoshopped onto a kicker's body so his son could be admitted as a recruit of the university's football team. McGlashan is one of 50 defendants in the nationwide case made public Tuesday when indictments were unsealed.
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, Hercules Capital private equity founder Manuel Henriquez, who is among those charged in the bribery scandal, has stepped down as CEO and chairman of that Palo Alto hedge fund. Hercules announced Wednesday that Henriquez will remain on the board and as an adviser to the company.
McGlashan also is on leave from some of his other commitments, including the advisory board of Stanford Graduate School of Business, a department spokeswoman said Wednesday. McGlashan has an MBA from the department and also is a graduate of Yale.
He serves on the board of Common Sense Growth, the investing arm of San Francisco nonprofit Common Sense Media, a tech and entertainment advocacy group for children and families. Common Sense said Wednesday that McGlashan remains on the board but that it would have no additional comment.
McGlashan is on the board of trustees at Marin Academy, the private prep school in San Rafael, which in a statement Tuesday denied knowing about the "alleged illegal and highly unethical behavior detailed in the charges."
In addition, McGlashan is listed on the boards of Brava, a Redwood City company that makes smart ovens, and e.l.f. Beauty, a cosmetics company based in Oakland. Those companies did not return requests for comment Wednesday.
McGlashan also is in the entertainment business. He is co-founder and board member of STX Entertainment, a Burbank-based company that has produced movies such as "The Upside," "Second Act," "Bad Moms" and more. STX assured employees Wednesday that TPG remains committed to STX, that other TPG executives remain on the board and that McGlashan's board seat will be filled.

'Malta Exchange' would test a saint's patience

Texto completo: In Rome, the college of cardinals is gathering to mourn one pope and select his successor. An ambitious rogue cardinal arrives on the island of Malta seeking ancient documents from the secretive Knights of Malta that will pave his way to the papacy. These are just two strands of the convoluted plot of "The Malta Exchange" (Minotaur Books, 393 pp., ), the 14th novel by Steve Berry featuring Cotton Malone, a retired Justice Department operative turned seller of rare books.
Malone arrives in Lake Como, Italy, in pursuit of letters exchanged between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini that British intelligence fears will reveal some embarrassing dealmaking aimed at preventing Italy from joining forces with Germany in World War II.
Why is this so urgent in the 21st century? You got me. But Berry is a New York Times best-selling author, so to quote Pope Francis, "Who am I to judge?"
As Malone arrives at a villa to nab the letters, bullets zing by, bodies are strung up and, inexplicably, a bear rumbling through the villa attacks Malone. Soon, Malone is entwined in the case of Cardinal Gallo, the papal wannabe, and a murderous subsector of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic humanitarian group with its own agenda for the new pope. Gallo's estranged identical twin, Pollux, has been temporarily placed in charge of the Knights, seeking to thwart his brother's ambitions.
Author Berry has a passion for history and historical preservation, so look for long passages about the Catholic Church, Constantine, Mussolini and various other European conquerors. You'll find yourself wondering about several key plot points: Is any of this really true? For the most part, Berry confesses in an epilogue at the end, it isn't.
If you can make your way through a tortuous plot with dialogue that can be as wooden as a church pew, Berry makes some interesting points about religion and how powerful men created the tenets of faith (manufacturing the concepts of ideas of heaven, hell and the devil) to control the masses. But in the finale, good old Cotton shows he has a taste of his own for some righteous religious vengeance.
Steve Berry is passionate about history.

Texto completo: The path to reunification for some immigrant families who have been split up amid the Trump administration's crackdown on the southwest border runs through an aging strip mall in the Atlanta suburbs.
Sitting around the corner from a thrift store and a coin laundry at Lawrenceville Square, Copacabana Travel Management is the small travel agency recommended by the largest network of shelters caring for the immigrant children.
Now an immigrant aid group is crying foul, citing high travel costs and saying the nonprofit shelter agency, Southwest Key Programs, has pressured its clients to use Copacabana. Southwest Key, a Texas-based nonprofit that is housing about 3,900 of the children through an agreement with the federal government, could not say who began referring parents to Copacabana or precisely when, but it insists immigrant parents can make their own travel arrangements.
The New York Times reported in December that the U.S. Justice Department is probing Southwest Key for possible misuse of federal money. The nonprofit allegedly engaged in potential self-dealing with its top executives, stockpiled tens of millions of taxpayer dollars and lent out millions for real estate purchases, acting more like a bank than a traditional charity, according to The Times' reporting. The Justice Department declined to comment.
Southwest Key, which has reportedly collected $1.8 billion in federal grants in the past decade, announced Monday that its founder and CEO, Juan Sanchez, is retiring. In a statement, Sanchez said "unfair criticism" had become a distraction for employees and that Southwest Key would benefit from "a fresh perspective." A spokesman for the nonprofit said his retirement is unrelated to Copacabana but declined to comment about the federal investigation.
First reported by Texas Monthly, the controversy surrounding Copacabana comes as the Trump administration is still working to reunite immigrant families separated at the southwest border.
Facing a storm of protests over his administration's "zero tolerance" policy, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in June that was meant to end such separations. Yet, the government has split up 245 immigrant families since that month, federal court records show.
Immigrant Families Together, a New York City-based humanitarian organization that is helping immigrant families reunite, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Southwest Key has referred at least six of its clients to Copacabana in recent months.
Among them was a Guatemalan man who sought in August to get his then-15-year-old son on a flight from Southwest Key's shelter in Brownsville, Texas -- a converted Walmart store called Casa Padre -- to him in New York City, said Julie Schwietert Collazo, co-founder and director of Immigrant Families Together.He booked his travel through Copacabana, Collazo said, for $1,030.
"It has never been presented to any of the families we have dealt with that Copacabana is a choice," Collazo said.
Southwest Key started referring people to the travel agency a decade ago, Southwest Key spokesman Neil Nowlin said, because it had a bilingual staff, "worked extended hours and accepted Western Union and Money-Gram(money transfers)--all important to the families we are serving."
No one at Southwest Key remembers who first began steering people to Copacabana, said Nowlin, adding the two organizations don't have a contract. Nowlin said his agency has not kept track of how many referrals it has made to Copacabana.
After Texas Monthly published its article this month, Southwest Key sent an email to its caseworkers, telling them parents can book their own travel, use travel agencies other than Copacabana or come to the shelters and pick up their children.
"Many choose to ask for help because arrangements must be made quickly," Nowlin said. "We have 72 hours between the time we know an unaccompanied minor is approved for reunification and our obligation to get them to their new home."
Nowlin added that Southwest Key opposes separating immigrant families at the border, calling it "a policy that hurt children, parents and our communities."
Sandra Quiroga is identified as Copacabana's manager in Georgia secretary of state records for the limited liability company. She did not respond to requests for comment.
A woman working at the front desk at Copacabana's office in Lawrenceville said she was not authorized to comment.
The company's attorney, Rodney Gould, said Southwest Key learned of Copacabana by word of mouth years ago after one its customers in Texas had a good experience booking a trip to Central America with the travel agency.He did not know how many bookings Copacabana has handled for immigrant families connected to Southwest Key.
"Copacabana has a pretty good track record of being able to get them on planes and get them where they are going," he said.
The travel agency collects up to $35 in fees for each trip it books in connection with children under Southwest Key's care, Gould said. Such ticket prices can run higher than usual, he said, because they must be booked with short notice and sometimes require additional fees for adult chaperones for unaccompanied minors.
Gould said he does not expect Copacabana's relationship with Southwest Key will change based on the reported federal investigation of the nonprofit shelter agency.
"If there is a federal investigation of Southwest Key," he said, "I am not sure what it relates to, although my guess is that it probably doesn't relate to anything to do with the ticketing of the migrants going to sponsors."

Media: Trump executive overreach is bad, Gavin Newsom's is good?

Texto completo: Is the media biased? Divergent reporting on two recent executive actions would suggest so.

Let's begin with President Trump's emergency declaration on the border situation. That received significant media criticism as an undemocratic sidestepping of Constitutional order and a clear example of bad government. But where is the media criticism of Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif.? Because Newsom's death penalty moratorium on Wednesday is a very similar executive overreach.

Let's start with the similarities. Just as Trump's declaration jumps around Congressional sentiment, Newsom has jumped around legislative action. Just as Trump's action has little public support, Newsom's overrules a 2016 ballot referendum that upheld the death penalty.

But in some ways Newsom's action is even more immoral than Trump's. Newsom has just overruled the judicial will of 737 separate juries. An intrinsic principle of American governance is the insulation of the judiciary from executive diktat. Newsom has just shredded that principle, indiscriminately commuting hundreds of sentences.

Much of the media doesn't appear to care, however.

In his report, Vox.com's Dylan Scott totally ignores victims' families and avoids scrutiny of death row inmates' crimes. Instead, he spends most of his article suggesting that support for the death penalty is racist. Many other media outlets have echoed this sympathy. CNN calls Newsom's action "a bold stroke." The New York Times' salutes Newsom's "soul searching." NPR implies Newsom's action is moral because "public opinion in California on capital punishment has shifted dramatically in the past few decades."

Trump executive overreach: bad, Newsom executive overreach: good. Interesting, isn't it?

Texto completo: Dick's Sporting Goods announced Tuesday it will remove firearms from 125 of its stores, according to news reports. The move follows the company's ban on assault-style weapons last year in the wake of the Parkland shooting.
CEO Ed Stack said Tuesday that Dick's will pull hunting gear from 125 stores starting in around August in response to its slumping sales in those stores, Bloomberg reported, a move that may spread to more stores next year.
It is unknown if the list of 125 stories includes any in the Southern Tier.
Dick's last year announced it would ban sales of assault-style weapons after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and revelations that its shooter, Nikolas Cruz, had purchased a gun from a Dick's store. The company also halted sales of high-capacity magazines and guns to anyone under 21 years old.

Hunting products started vanishing from 10 Dick's stores last fall as the retailer swapped those items for products such as kayaks and baseball gear. Stack said the stores saw higher sales, margins and foot traffic than when they had guns, according to Bloomberg.
Halting assault-style weapon sales put a dent in overall sales for Dick's, the company noted last fall, a dip furthered by a weaker gun market. On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh-area company said net income for the quarter fell to $102. 6 million from $116 million in the year-earlier period, per MarketWatch.
Adjusted same-store sales fell 3. 1 percent over a 12-month period ending Feb. 2 when compared to that period the year prior, The New York Times reported.
Dick's operates 729 stores — including ones in Binghamton, Vestal, Horseheads and Ithaca — along with 94 Golf Galaxy stores and 35 Field and Stream stores (including one in Big Flats), according to the newspaper.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation expelled Dick's from membership last year for "conduct detrimental" to the firearms trade group, but Stack remains undeterred in the company's direction.
"If we had a mulligan, we'd do it all over again," Stack said, per CNBC.
The CEO signed a letter last month backing a federal bill extending background checks, the network noted, and recently joined the Everytown Business Council for gun safety.

Texto completo: What insights can former President Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Richard Branson impart about running your small business? Solid ones, it turns out.
Those three were the powerhouse speakers addressing the crowd of 11,000 at the Qualtrics X4 Summit last week.
Though neither the conference nor the speeches were political, Obama did take the opportunity to call on us to respect our democracy and each other.
“We live in such a polarized time,” Obama said at the Salt Lake City event presented by Qualtrics, the experience management software company recently bought by SAP for $8 billion.
“If you watch Fox News, you’re in one reality, and if you read The New York Times, you’re in a different reality. . . . It’s been challenging to have a common conversation. . . . If we listen to the voices that help us rediscover our common hopes and dreams and values rather than constantly gravitating to those things that push us apart, that oftentimes are designed to make us angry . . we can accomplish big things. ”
Obama also said: “Things like rule of law, competence and facts are not partisan ideas. Nor do they happen automatically. There must be citizens who insist that they happen. A democracy is a garden that must be tended to carefully. ”
Here are other insights helpful to small business owners:
Overcoming fear: “What’s happened to me over the last decade is a shedding of fear,” Obama said. “(There were) times when you were constrained by, ‘Man, I don’t want to screw this up, let people down, be seen as a failure. ' . . . I was a better president in my second term not because of policy, (but) you get enough reps and familiarity that you stay focused on the task and not on how you are doing the task. ”
Handling your ego: “By taking your ego out of what you do, it liberates you and makes you more able to do it,” said Obama. “You get more accomplished . . . one of the problems with people in big jobs is they start feeling like, ‘I have to project that I have every answer. '” He said he was not afraid to ask questions and rely on those who had more expertise on a a particular subject.
Being clear about your goals: Oprah Winfrey emphasized the importance of the word intent. “I don’t do anything without thinking about what I ultimately want the energy, the motivation I’m putting into it (to be). . . . The intention is the force field that carries from the action and all the way to the end result. ” Oprah told her staff, "Don't come to me with an idea unless you know why you're doing it. "
Hiring: Obama and Richard Branson had good advice on hiring. “I was good at making sure that the people who are working for me, with me, were there for the right reasons and there was a core integrity to what they were doing," said Obama. And Branson: “Find somebody that’s better than yourself and leave day-to-day (issues) to someone else . . . “don’t try to do everything yourself. ”
Employee treatment: “All that business is, is a group of people,” said Branson. “We (at Virgin companies) do everything we can to insure we have the happiest people . . . the reason people leave companies is because they’re not being listened to. ” He also decried the lack of required paid holidays in the U. S. — the worst holiday policy of any advanced economy. "Something of a disgrace," he called it.
Company culture: "If you can build a culture where it's about solving the problem, or getting the work done, as opposed to who’s getting the credit or 'how much money am I making out of this' or what have you, that builds a transparency that allows for good decision-making because there’s clarity about the goals and objectives and values at the heart of the organization,” Obama said. “And it also means that you don’t have big scandals and indictments. "
Purpose: Oprah's "show wasn’t about a show nor is any of our work really about the work," Winfrey said. "It’s about how you use your inner self, your one grand, big, precious life in service to the world. . . . Ultimately you want to be able to live out the fullest, highest truest expression of yourself as a human being. "

Overwhelmed southern border now wrecking the legal immigration process

Texto completo: Democrats and even some dim Republicans can say there’s no emergency on the southern border, but that doesn’t lessen the unending flow of migrants showing up and straining our resources. You can’t have an unabated stream of people coming in from Latin America claiming asylum, i.e. legal protection for indefinite stay in the U.S., and at the same time administer all the people who want to come in the proper way.

It’s impossible, and a New York Times report on Tuesday detailed how the Trump administration is drowning in the reality ignored by Congress.

The paper said that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Lee Cissna told staff this week that operations abroad would close down so that resources could be directed “to handle the lengthy backlog in asylum applications from tens of thousands of migrants crossing the southern border every month.”

This means foreigners wanting to come to the U.S., Americans who want to move family from abroad, and otherwise legitimate asylum claims will no longer be processed in a timely, orderly way, if they are at all.

Immigration Services has been sounding the alarm on the overwhelming number of asylum cases since at least January 2018. The agency said then that it was instituting a policy to deal with the newest asylum cases first and work backward to older ones, a “last in, first out” approach meant to quickly deport illegal immigrants hoping to remain in the country at length.

That, of course, is to the detriment of asylum seekers who were here first and who may actually face persecution in their home countries. Those cases were pushed behind new ones of migrants who merely floated across the Rio Grande, hit the Texas bank, and found a border patrol agent to tell, "Asilo por favor!"

Back then, the agency said the backlog of asylum cases was more than 300,000. The backlog has more than doubled since then, due to our abhorrent open-border policy that allows anyone who sets foot on American soil to claim asylum — it's very easy — guaranteeing them the right to stay here, at least until their court date, and up to 40 percent of asylum seekers don’t even turn up for those.

Democrats have opposed President Trump at every turn in addressing the southern border crisis. Even some Republicans have joined them. They will inevitably complain about the redirecting of resources to deal with the asylum backlog, too.

Members of Congress largely don’t have to deal with the ramifications of our immigration system, which the way it’s written says anyone who wants in and can set foot on land gets to stay. The violent MS-13 gang isn’t terrorizing their children’s schools. Their neighborhoods aren’t morphing into silos of completely foreign cultures.

OK, fine, I guess. But laws of supply and demand still apply, and right now, there is not enough supply to meet the demand at the southern border.

Something has to give. Unfortunately for any American wanting to adopt a foreign baby or any military service member wanting to bring their new spouse home from abroad, it might be them.

Texto completo: Un grupo de lectores, mayormente venezolanos, se reunió el lunes al mediodía frente al edificio del diario The New York Times para protestar lo que calificaron como política editorial “tendenciosa” y “desinformativa” sobre la crisis humanitaria y política que se vive en ese país suramericano.
En particular la protesta fue motivada por un reporte publicado el domingo donde acusaban a la oposición venezolana y el gobierno del presidente colombiano Iván Duque de ser responsables de la quema de un camión con ayuda humanitaria en la frontera el pasado 23 de febrero, acción que el mandatario Donald Trump adjudicó a seguidores de Nicolás Maduro, opuesto a la entrada de auxilio internacional en un tono hostil.
De hecho, la vicepresidenta de Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez, confesó al día siguiente que la violencia vivida en la frontera fue sólo “un pedacito de lo que nosotros estamos dispuestos a hacer”.
Pero The New York Times publicó que su investigación había determinado lo contrario. En el pasado, el diario neoyorquino, el más importante de Estados Unidos, se ha destacado por su crítica al gobierno de Trump, tanto en política interna como exterior.
Al bajar a conversar con los manifestantes, la reportera Deborah Acosta afirmó que lo publicado había sido producto de una investigación exhaustiva de análisis de videos, aunque admitió que la situación ese día fue confusa y que el diario estaba enviando más periodistas a la zona para cubrir la tensa situación.
Además del reporte en sí, los manifestantes cuestionaron que haya sido publicado justo el fin de semana, mientras en Venezuela se vivía una “situación desesperada” de muertes en hospitales, saqueos e incomunicación durante el mayor apagón en la historia del país; algo que, según ellos, The New York Times no había desplegado de manera proporcional “por su oposición permanente a Trump”, comentó la activista Gloria Requena.
Acosta insistió ante los presentes que el reporte se había publicado el domingo 10 de marzo porque fue entonces cuando habían concluido su investigación.
“¿Cómo se refieren ustedes a Guaidó?”, preguntó Acosta a los presentes sobre el presidente del Parlamento, que declaró ilegal el mandato de Maduro. A coro, la mayoría respondió: “Es el presidente encargado de Venezuela”. Y la reportera tomó nota.
“Pedimos al New York Times que dejen de usar nuestra crisis en su juicio político en Estados Unidos”, declaró a la agencia EFE Erick Rozo, coordinador en Nueva York del partido venezolano Voluntad Popular, al que pertenece el ingeniero Guaidó,
Rebeca Zambrano, miembro de la asociación “Independent Venezuelan American Citizens”, denunció que “en vez de hablar de cuánta gente está muriendo en Venezuela, de cuántos niños necesitaban esa ayuda, el New York Times decidió hablar de un video no concluyente”.
“Maduro dijo que no los iban a dejar entrar (los camiones con ayuda humanitaria), la canciller Delcy Rodríguez dijo que lo que vimos era sólo una muestra de lo que eran capaces de hacer”, resumió la activista, preguntándose entonces cómo en su reportaje el New York Times los eximió de culpa, por acción u omisión.
En septiembre pasado, un venezolano se desnudó frente a la sede del New York Times, también reclamando una cobertura a la crisis de su país que no fuese usada como excusa para juzgar a Trump.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Soleil Ho is here, and she doesn't want anyone to know it. But the San Francisco Chronicle's new restaurant critic could pass for younger than her 31 years, so when a server asks her for ID after she orders a cocktail, she winces imperceptibly. She's not truly anonymous - after years of posting photos on social media, never expecting to get a job as a critic, that ship has sailed - but she doesn't want special treatment. She's armed with fake names and new credit cards. But getting carded is "the one thing you cannot bulls---, because it is illegal," she said.
The server studies it and mouths the words "Ho, Soleil," and her date of birth, but there's no recognition in her eyes.
Soleil Ho is here, and everyone knows it. It's the week her long-awaited first reviews will be published, and there is intense speculation on Eater and SFist about how she will approach the varied restaurants of the Bay Area, where she moved in January after accepting this job, replacing a predecessor who had held the job since she was "not even a fetus," she says.
And that's why, the day before, Ho was lingering in a hallway, bracing herself to enter a room at the Chronicle building downtown, where readers, chefs and publicists were armed with questions for a Q&A.
"Should I go in there?" she asked her editor, Paolo Lucchesi. She's nervous, but once the questions began, you would never have known it.
What did she do before she got this job? She worked as a freelance writer, podcaster and chef in Minneapolis; Portland, Ore.; New Orleans and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. What parts of the Bay Area's food scene have intrigued her the most? The immigrant-owned restaurants in Fremont, she said, plus, "The Pacifica Taco Bell has been a highlight." Will she continue podcasting for the Chronicle now that her popular podcast, "The Racist Sandwich," which explored issues of culinary appropriation and representation, is on hiatus? Yes, and she's starting a newsletter, too - called "Bite Curious," a wink at her queer identity. Her least favorite food? Green bell peppers.
How will she approach the job? By writing about restaurants that tell a story - one that might touch on race, gender, class or the culture of the Bay Area. By following a strict ethical code, even though her appearance won't be a secret. By eliminating the star system in favor of a more nuanced analysis.
"Wait," asked publicist and restaurant owner Jen Pelka, from the audience. "You're saying you're not doing stars?"
The room broke into a round of applause, as if to say, we're so glad Soleil Ho is here.
The first wave of modern food criticism included white critics who reviewed prestige restaurants for prestige publications, such as the New York Times' Craig Claiborne. French chefs were idolized. Formal dining was the standard.
The second wave brought writers and such personalities as Jonathan Gold, Anthony Bourdain, Tyler Cowen and Ruth Reichl: (Mostly) still male, still white; but for people who looked like them, they were the gateway to foods from other cultures. They wrote about immigrant foods with deference and sensitivity, and importantly, with specificity, distinguishing between regional customs and flavors, and incorporating history, culture and politics into their assessments. But for those cuisines, they were still outsiders.
You might say that the third wave is Ho. Raised in New York by her Vietnamese family, Ho is a third-culture kid who grew up eating her grandparents' Vietnamese food as well as the takeout that her mother, a buyer for fashion brands, would order for her and her sister. "I still, to this day, know the number for McDonald's delivery," she said. In an essay for Bitch magazine, she wrote of how she longed for the simplicity of Bagel Bites over "brothy, weirdly fishy" Vietnamese dishes, in part because of kids who made fun of her food.
After graduating from Iowa's Grinnell College in 2009, when jobs were scarce, Ho entered the food industry, working at an organic farm, and then at restaurants across the country, where she acquired a disdain for critics. Her mother left New York to open a restaurant in Puerto Vallarta, and Ho followed, doing freelance writing and podcasts in the mornings, and a kitchen shift in the afternoons and nights. Before that, she worked as an executive chef at a restaurant in Portland, where she said she experienced the toxic side of the industry: The owners, she alleges, made racist and harassing statements, "Like, 'ching chong.' . . . That was also the time I was doing Racist Sandwich. That frustration fueled a lot of that work."
Having traversed both sides, she's uniquely positioned to tackle some of the most pressing issues in the food world, some of which were themes in her first reviews: What's the difference between appreciation and appropriation? What's the true cost of food and the labor to produce it? How do we make the restaurant industry more equitable, more accessible, more just?
Addressing those issues via criticism will be a seismic shift for the Bay Area. While food has always been political here, there were long complaints that the former critic, Michael Bauer, was ethically compromised, and favored splashy prestige dining over immigrant cuisine. Ho was hired as his replacement after Bill Addison and Patricia Escárcega were announced as replacements for the late Gold at the Los Angeles Times, and Tejal Rao was named California restaurant critic for the New York Times. Collectively, their voices are shifting the center of gravity for America's culinary media westward.
"There's this wonderful cosmic timing that's worked out," said Rao, who is friends with Ho. "We're both establishing authority in these new cities and these new roles. We're both millennial women of color. . . . We're rooting for each other."
Ho lives near Golden Gate Park in the Richmond District, where dim sum restaurants and coffee shops are interspersed with Russian restaurants.
Her apartment has still-unpacked boxes of cookbooks - "Jerusalem," "Vegan Soul Kitchen," "On Eating Insects" - and little art on the walls yet, save for one remnant from Ho's past as chef: She competed in Ment'or, a young chef competition in 2014. A plaque features a photo of her throwing a peace sign next to Thomas Keller.
"So many things have happened since then," Ho said. "Thomas Keller and Roland Passot, they are both judges in this competition, and now I will have written reviews of [two] of their restaurants."
One of Ho's first reviews is of La Calenda, Keller's Mexican restaurant. It's exactly the type of place that longtime readers of Ho would expect her to skewer, because Keller is not Mexican. But the review subverted readers' expectations; its headline called the restaurant "cultural appropriation done right."
"There's this misconception that because of the work I did at Racist Sandwich . . . that I am the PC police," she said. Publishing five reviews simultaneously was a strategy.
"People are going to pick apart everything, so the idea is give them a whole lot of s--- to pick apart," she said. Rather than putting all the weight on one restaurant, "it's almost a snapshot about what I've been thinking of."
Eliminating stars is another way she's changing things up at the Chronicle. Because Ho will be reviewing everything from tortas to molecular gastronomy, she wrote, "I believe imposing a star rating system that purports to put all of those things along the same spectrum would do a disservice to all of them."
As Lucchesi, her editor, put it: "She's fresh eyes, so she has the ability and the opportunity to look at these conventions that have been in place for decades. She's not going to have to do something because it's been done."

Soleil Ho is here, and not everyone is happy about it. The backlash to her first reviews began shortly after they were published, when people latched onto her criticism of Chez Panisse. She wrote that the famed restaurant was "listless" and that it "has pushed the culinary conversation in this country forward, but then seems to have stood still since then."
When Chez Panisse founder and chef Alice Waters read the review, "my friends called to say, 'I hope you're not worried about that,' " Waters said. "I knew, certainly, the old writer, who's a good friend of mine."
She took to heart Ho's critique of the way dishes were plated - "I am not one to shy away from criticism" - but said she was surprised by the review's theme.
"I think it wasn't fair to say that a restaurant that has a philosophy of food that's important is maybe getting old and tired," Waters said. "That can never get old and tired. Supporting people who are taking care of the land is the most important thing we can do on this planet right now."
Chefs such as Benu's Corey Lee and food writer Mimi Sheraton, previously the first female food critic for the New York Times, bristled at Ho's initial writing.
"So far, new SFChronicle food critic, Soleil Ho, is too full of herself," tweeted Sheraton. "Should stop explaining what she stands for and just start reporting and critiquing."
Ho expected this.
"The things that I say, and the things that black women, even more so, say in an online space, get blown up even more into this aggro tone that we don't have," Ho said. "People will misread it, whether intentionally or because they're trained to look for hostility where there has been none."
When Ho walks into a restaurant, she always has a member of her party scout out whether the bathrooms are gender-neutral. She also considers accessibility for people with disabilities and the availability of plant-based dishes on the menu.
"The bathrooms are so neutral, I didn't even know where I was," shouts Ho's 26-year-old sister, visiting from Phoenix, over the din of a wine bar. The Post agreed not to use her sister's name, because Ho uses it to make reservations for herself.
Maybe all of Ho's life has been a dance between cultures, identities and names.
"I never thought the name fit me. It's a little too cute," Ho says. "I don't feel like a Soleil [pronounced so-lay]. My Vietnamese name is Vy, and that's what most of my family calls me."
That includes her husband, Chris Farstad (Ho identifies as queer and, when pressed, refers to herself as "pansexual."). He joins her for most meals - "It's free dinner," he shrugs - and is still getting used to her new ethical framework.
Before another evening's review dinner, when Ho and Farstad arrive at a restaurant, she asks Farstad to request a table on her behalf. But he's confused: "Can you level with me about why I'm doing this?" he asks. She discreetly explains that it will help her avoid detection.
"He's still getting the hang of this," she says, as he goes back to the host. Early on, when he met her at the restaurant Angler, he asked the host if there was a reservation under her real name.
In the days before her first reviews were published, there were other firsts. She experienced a food critic rite of passage - a mild case of food poisoning. It wasn't the dairy - "Kryptonite for Asian people," she quipped - but something else. She won't be going back to that wine bar anytime soon.
Ho might have taken a night off when she was a freelancer, but now, she eats for a living. So, at 5:30 p.m., on a drizzly San Francisco evening, a Lyft is taking her through the Presidio, and as soon as the Golden Gate appears, she smiles and claps.
"I'm still kind of like a cheesy tourist, I get excited about that stuff," she says. It isn't long before the car pulls up to another restaurant, and she's here.

Making an egg out of an omelet

Texto completo: According to the Roman calendar, the Ides of March was the ancient empires traditional day to settle debts. In 44 B.C., Brutus and Cassius, two of Romes elite senators, settled a political debt with Julius Caesar, their emperor, by stabbing him to death in the Senate on the Ides, or March 15.
Little blood is spilled on democracys great debating floors today. Still, political careers do die on them regularly. An unwise alliance here, a loose tongue there and, thud, another public career is as dead as, well, Caesar.
That thud might soon ring in Great Britains House of Commons, says Roger Cohen, an astute observer of British politics. It will be, predicts Cohen, who grew up in England, the sound of Prime Minister Theresa Mays career hitting rock bottom somewhere around March 15 as she retreats  asks for an extension  to the March 29 deadline for the UK to leave, or Brexit, the European Union.
But that doesnt mean Brexit will die, suspects Cohen in his March 2 New York Times column. Anything is possible, he says, because Britains politics, like Americas, now operate from either the left or the right, not the center where leaders once met to arbitrate policy. That middle ground is now career quicksand.
The bilateral comparison isnt perfect, but Mays loyalty to her political right and its anti-EU push has parallels in the United States and to President Donald J. Trumps devotion to the right wing of his political party.
For example, both May and Trump preside over deeply divided governments. Both use nationalism to recharge their power if it begins to fade. And while both nations are deeply embedded in the global economy, each believes they can stand alone  get better deals  in contentious issues like trade and nuclear weapons.
After three years of Brexit maneuvering and two years of unpredictable Trumpism, however, two realities are beginning to surface with the political left, right, and center in each nation. First, going it alone may not be achievable and, second, its probably not what either nation needs anyway.
That means, Cohen surmises, recent seat-of-the-pants policy-making by novices and neo-whatevers needs to yield to people who have the knowledge and experience to bridge todays growing gaps in trade, finance and diplomacy.
Few know this better than U.S. farmers and ranchers who have held their collective tongue while the White House used the last two years to level the playing field in multilateral trade, explains the Global Trade and Analysis Project at Purdue University.
Those trade tactics, however, says the Purdue group, have done more burying than leveling. The White Houses first move, pulling out of the almost-done Trans-Pacific Partnership, now reduces agricultural and food exports by $1.8 billion a year.
Worse, If the current U.S. trade policy were to continue toward protectionism, GTAP surmises, U.S. agricultural exports would drop by $21.8 billion (which) would result in an aggregate welfare loss of $42.5 billion to the U.S. economy
Keep in mind that this forecast didnt originate with some Trump-scorned news network or liberal think tank. Its the analysis of trade experts at Purdue University, the intellectual home to American agricultures patron saint of free markets, Earl Fencerow Butz.
What does all this mean? GTAP asks in its final analysis.
It suggests that U.S. agriculture is entering a volatile period in international trade. The data suggests the sector currently risks losing much of the trade achieved over the past three decades.
Times columnist Cohen expresses the same thought differently; he quotes Pascal Lamy, the former head of the World Trade Organization who, when asked to comment on whether Brexit would succeed, wryly noted, Its not easy making an egg out of an omelet.
No, its not. But that doesnt mean this White House  or Ms. May  wont continue to try.

The rise, set and rise of daylight saving time; Why we spring ahead so it stays light later has to do with war - and hobbies

Texto completo: As you grumble about your lost hour of sleep this weekend, just remember: Don't blame Benjamin Franklin. Despite legend, the nerdiest founding father did not invent daylight saving time. (He suggested cities wake residents earlier on summer mornings by the sound of cannon fire, so perhaps it's best he didn't get his way.)
No, the reason you may need an extra cup of coffee Sunday is because of World War I. And golf.
Changing clocks in the summer was first proposed around the turn of the 20th century by two guys who came up with it separately, though for the same reason. New Zealander George Hudson and Englishman William Willett both wanted more time after work in the summer for their sunlight-required pastimes - in Willett's case, hitting the links, and in Hudson's, collecting bugs. And really, why let time itself keep you from your hobbies?
Neither men's proposals gained much traction, however, until the outbreak of the World War I. The Germans were the first to do it, on April 30, 1916, as a way to save on coal-powered lighting in factories. British politicians moved to follow suit two days later and had set their clocks forward by the end of May. Most other European countries weren't far behind.
Time was a little slower to change in the United States, which did not join the war until 1917. Stockbrokers and manufacturers made a flurry of patriotic posters in support of daylight saving. But railroad companies, afraid confusion around the time change could cause a deadly crash, were adamantly against it. So were farmers, who worked by the sun anyway and did not want interactions with the clock-keeping world to get screwy.
"If you're a farmer, you can't just go work an hour early, because you need the sunlight to see what you're doing, especially in those days," says David Prerau, author of "Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time."

Texto completo: As you grumble about your lost hour of sleep this weekend, just remember: Don't blame Benjamin Franklin. Despite legend, the nerdiest founding father did not invent daylight saving time. (He suggested cities wake residents earlier on summer mornings by the sound of cannon fire, so perhaps it's best he didn't get his way.)
No, the reason you may need an extra cup of coffee Sunday is because of World War I. And golf.
Changing clocks in the summer was first proposed around the turn of the 20th century by two guys who came up with it separately, though for the same reason. New Zealander George Hudson and Englishman William Willett both wanted more time after work in the summer for their sunlight-required pastimes - in Willett's case, hitting the links, and in Hudson's, collecting bugs. And really, why let time itself keep you from your hobbies?
Neither men's proposals gained much traction, however, until the outbreak of the World War I. The Germans were the first to do it, on April 30, 1916, as a way to save on coal-powered lighting in factories. British politicians moved to follow suit two days later and had set their clocks forward by the end of May. Most other European countries weren't far behind.
Time was a little slower to change in the United States, which did not join the war until 1917. Stockbrokers and manufacturers made a flurry of patriotic posters in support of daylight saving. But railroad companies, afraid confusion around the time change could cause a deadly crash, were adamantly against it. So were farmers, who worked by the sun anyway and did not want interactions with the clock-keeping world to get screwy.
"If you're a farmer, you can't just go work an hour early, because you need the sunlight to see what you're doing, especially in those days," says David Prerau, author of "Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time." This was especially hard on dairy farmers, who would have to start milking cows in the dark to meet train schedules for delivery.
"Plus, the sun, beside giving light, it gives heat, and it drives off the dew on a lot of the things that have to be harvested. And you can't harvest things when they're wet," Prerau says.

Texto completo: BEHIND THE BYLINE Jenna Wortham
Jenna Wortham on the Exhilarating Work That Leaves Her 'Naked and Shivering'
Interview by Lara Takenaga
______
The Reader Center has started a new series of short interviews, Behind the Byline , to introduce you to Times journalists. Is there a reporter, photographer or editor whom you would like to get to know? Tell us in the form below.
There are many claims to fame among New York Times journalists, but only one of us has received a note from Beyoncé saying, "Thanks for understanding my heart."
That lifetime bragging right belongs to Jenna Wortham, a staff writer for The Times Magazine and a co-host of the podcast "Still Processing." Since joining The Times in 2008, she has found a vast, loyal audience for her original takes on pop culture, technology and race. And on social media, where you may know her as @jennydeluxe, she has become something of a cult figure to her hundreds of thousands of followers.
[Read Jenna's piece about Beyoncé and Jay-Z in the magazine's Music Issue.]
Here, Jenna talks about being a young woman of color in journalism, the challenges of social media and her love for a certain reality show.
You're a beloved (and often hilarious) presence on Twitter and Instagram , where you've attracted huge followings. How do you think about your life on social media?
I try to be extremely aware of my urges to contribute to social media and of the way it feels to observe others' highly curated looking glasses. Why do I want to share? What does it mean to parcel out bits of myself for consumption? What does it mean to consume others' bits?
I really love getting insights into the highs and lows of the human experience and, at the same time, am aware that we're being coerced into participating by companies that trade on our emotions and impulses.
At social media's best, I'm laughing alongside some of the most interesting and innovative D.I.Y. creators of my time. At its worst, I'm experiencing a desperate longing for a life that is not mine. That's a hard spectrum to travel along on a daily basis.
What obstacles have you faced as a young person of color working in journalism?
For a long time, the issues that concerned me and my communities the most felt difficult to get other people to rally around: pay inequality, the exploitation of marginalized people, digital imperialism, skepticism of Silicon Valley's values, and wellness and mental health. These things are now of the utmost interest, and that is the most satisfying evolution to observe and participate in.
How do you juggle being a writer and a podcast co-host?
Podcasting requires an intense amount of collaboration that is fairly foreign to me as a writer.
The real-time externalization of thoughts is a different skill set from what I've cultivated in my 10 years as a reporter. I feel like I'm learning how to communicate differently, how to work on a team and how to allow myself to feel exposed while a work is in progress. You feel naked and shivering all the time, and it's thoroughly exhilarating.
I bring some of that fearlessness to my writing -- I take more leaps and risks and chances, and it feels less scary when they aren't successful.
How do you spend your time when you're off duty?
Off-duty is such an interesting concept! Are any of us ever off?
I spend so much of my time invigorated by the ideas swirling around me. I read, I see films and art, I listen to podcasts and talks while I cook, and I see live music and local D.J.s. I practice reiki and do bodywork. I engage in other kinds of personal and spiritual development.
Many of my friends are creative types and makers, so we're always exchanging ideas and getting worked up around the dinner table. I feel really grateful and lucky to make a living doing what feeds me: synthesizing ideas.
But I know what you're really asking. Whenever I have a down moment, I like to take baths with lots of magnesium salt and dried calendula, and to spend time with friends or their babies. Intimate relationships are my lifeblood.
I also travel whenever I can. Last year, I went to the South of France and meditated and swam in the Mediterranean Sea. That rejuvenated me to deal with the stressors of daily life. In a few weeks I'm going to Greece to do something similar.
If you had to choose another job, in journalism or not, what would it be?
Is there a job where you get to be on the beach all day? I'd choose that. I am a water sign and love being near the ocean. Maybe I'd be a filmmaker and work on "Planet Earth: Blue Planet III."
What books have most influenced your work?
Books about fearless women who persevered in their fields because they knew their higher purpose was to be in service of equality and civil rights: "Eye on the Struggle: Ethel Payne, the First Lady of the Black Press," for instance, and "At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance -- A New History of the Civil Rights Movement From Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power." They help remind me to keep going when I get overwhelmed and feel like giving up.
"The Black Book," an anthology edited by Toni Morrison, and the publications of Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, started by Barbara Smith, have influenced my work on a visual anthology called "Black Futures" that I'm doing with Kimberly Drew. It will come out in 2020.
And Renee Gladman's books about the imaginary place Ravicka are profoundly reshaping how I think about language.
What's something that readers would be surprised to learn about you?
I spend more time offline than online. I don't have a value judgment about screen time; it's just that I've finally reached a point in my life and career where I spend a lot of time generating inspiration and ideas, not scrolling for them, and that is such a luxury.
Also, I love "Survivor." It's so good!

Neither men's proposals gained much traction, however, until the outbreak of the World War I.

Time was a little slower to change in the United States, which did not join the war until 1917. Stockbrokers and manufacturers made a flurry of patriotic posters in support of daylight saving.

"If you're a farmer, you can't just go work an hour early, because you need the sunlight to see what you're doing, especially in those days," says David Prerau, author of "Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time." This was especially hard on dairy farmers, who would have to start milking cows in the dark to meet train schedules for delivery.
"Plus, the sun, beside giving light, it gives heat, and it drives off the dew on a lot of the things that have to be harvested. And you can't harvest things when they're wet," Prerau says.
The stockbrokers won; a bill passed Congress and President Woodrow Wilson signed it. But the first nationwide time change suffered from some seriously unfortunate scheduling. It was March 31, 1918 - Easter Sunday. Newspapers published instructions on how and when to set clocks forward, and churches posted signs out front warning parishioners.
The Chicago Tribune called it "a lie that will benefit you and your country," which is a pretty weird way to put it.
At 2 a.m., a reception at Madison Square Garden marked the occasion, and in the U.S. Capitol, a few senators stayed awake with the Sergeant-at-Arms to reset the Ohio Clock.
The next day, things went surprisingly smoothly. "Some churchgoers were an hour late, but no baseball games were called on account of darkness," reported The New York Times. "Those looking to the sky at nightfall expecting to see a miracle were disappointed."
By the next year, the war had ended, and many thought daylight saving time should end with it, Prerau says. Lawmakers representing farmers introduced nearly two dozen bills to repeal it; one Mississippi congressman urged, "Repeal the law and have the clocks proclaim God's time and tell the truth!" A New Jersey congressman who supported it told people to think of the veterans coming home from the war, "Are they not deserving of the extra hour of recreation?"
A repeal sailed through the House, cleared the Senate and landed on Wilson's desk. He vetoed it, saying it could cause an economic downturn.
A vote to override the president's veto failed, but haters were unbowed. They passed another repeal bill, which the president vetoed again. But this time, they were better prepared, getting the two-thirds majority in the House and Senate needed to override the president. (All of this happened in a month; Congress used to be productive!) Daylight saving time was dead.

Cities like New York and Pittsburgh passed their own daylight saving time laws, and it was brought back nationally for a little while during World War II. As The Post's Michael S.

Texto completo: The 1893 Columbia Exposition of "White City" fame is more than a backdrop for the latest Leonardo DiCaprio movie or the latest effort to build something along Chicago’s coveted lakefront.
It is real, tangible history.
Between May 1 and Oct. 31, 1893, an estimated 27 million people visited the World’s Fair — nearly a quarter of nation’s population at the time. Chicago dedicated more than 600 acres, in and around Jackson Park for the occasion: honoring the 400th anniversary of Columbus’ discovery of the New World. Nearly 200 buildings — many gleaming white under awe-inspiring electric lighting at night, wound alongside canals and lagoons.
"Among the Chicago Park District’s many monuments is ‘The Republic,’ located in Jackson Park," wrote Virginia M. Meyer in the spring 1985 edition of the Chicago Genealogist. "‘The Republic’ is a statue replicate of stone which stood in the Court of Honor at the World’s Columbia Exposition in 1893. The gilded statue of Columbus was 60 feet in height and covered with gold leaf, a beautiful and artistic contrast to the classic white of the buildings and the blue of the water of the lagoons."
What buildings were not sold off or moved simply were demolished and buried on-site, said Rebecca Graff, assistant professor of anthropology and chair of the American studies at Lake Forest College. Graff and her team conducted two exploratory digs on the site in 2007 and 2008. She will talk about her findings and the future of this archaeological site — location for the new Obama Presidential Center — at 7 p.m. Monday, March 11, at the McHenry County Historical Museum in Union.
It is the first of four programs offered as part of the 33rd Annual Sampler Lecture Series. Admission is $10. Series tickets are $35, $30 for county historical society members.
"I just like old things," Graff said. "If you wanted to do archaeology, you had to be an anthropologist. It’s the people aspect. … Women, people of color, working class people, those who were illiterate and immigrants; they did not have their mundane experiences captured. What you have instead are the material traces of their lives."
Graff and her team conducted about 150 "shovel probes" about 27 inches deep all around the park.
"It was amazing. It felt like we were in ancient Rome," said Graff, whose book — "The Vanishing City and the Enduring Home: Approaching Modernity at Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition and the Charnley House" — is due out later this year.
Her past excavation in Jackson Park uncovered a robust sanitary infrastructure beneath the fair, portions of the Woman’s Building and delicate plaster remains of the Ohio State Building — which The New York Times claimed was thrown into Lake Michigan.
"Once we found the building, we assumed everyone would be super interested in the park," said Graff, who is hoping the Historic Preservation Act and a lawsuit by Protect Our Parks buys time for further archaeological investigation before contractors decimate the site.
"You would think that they (developers) would use this [White City legacy] as part of the grand history of this place."
Graff, a native Californian, speculated she might have a genetic propensity for digging in the dirt. Her great-grandfather, Russian immigrant Morris Graff, toiled as a laborer digging ditches on the original exposition midway.
"I want people to leave (the program) with an understanding of what archaeology is," Graff said. "We create a record of what we find and make sure that knowledge is available for all. … Archaeology is a team endeavor and that is why I love it."
Upcoming lectures in the series include: * 3 p.m., Monday, March 25 — Adventures with Audubon. Learn about celebrated naturalist and wildlife artist John James Audubon, as portrayed by Brian Fox Ellis of Bishop Hill, Illinois.
* 7 p.m. Monday, April 8 — A Peek into the American Indian Way of Life Through Their History and Oral Traditions. Freeport’s Kim Sigafus invites the audience to enter the world of the American Indian. Discover what it once was to be "native," and what it means to be "native" now.
* 3 p.m. Thursday, April 25 — McHenry County College history instructor Sarah Sullivan presents Marshall Field’s and Chicago. Learn about the events and personalities that made Marshall Field and Co. Chicago’s store and its founder a titan of retail.
All programs are at the Society museum, 6422 Main St. in Union. The Audubon and Native American programs are made possible through a grant from Illinois Humanities. For information, visit www.gothistory.org or call (815) 923-2267.

Sorry, but 'ISIS bride' is no victim

Texto completo: Has Hoda Muthana, 24, the so-called ISIS bride who joined the terrorist group at 19 and was widowed twice, ever heard of Civil War-era writer Edward Everett Hale?
I'd bet the answer is "No."
And that's unfortunate.
Because now I can't very well ask Muthana about Hale's famous story, "The Man Without a Country."
In part, that's because she's in a Syrian refugee camp, doing interviews and seeking pity from Americans as leverage against President Donald Trump, so she can get home to her family in Alabama and raise her baby boy in the good old U.S. of A.
"I realized I've made a big mistake and I know I've ruined my future and my son's future and I deeply, deeply regret it," she told the Guardian newspaper.
Being a victim is what it's all about now. That's her only play, to be a victim.
The ISIS bride is 24 now, a little older than my sons. She ran away from home at 19, made her way to Syria and joined ISIS, was married three times and widowed twice.
That's the thing about ISIS members: When they're not chopping the heads off Christians, Muslims and American journalists, they have a habit of getting killed themselves.
When she left America as a teenager, I've got a feeling ISIS bride wasn't condemning the monsters who took heads or burned people alive or drowned them in cages in the name of their god.
And I really don't think they teach Hale much in school these days, nor do schools teach civics that much.
Civics? You mean how government works and what, if any, are the responsibilities of American citizens?
Clearly, that kind of thing isn't taught in schools. If it were, then 60 percent of Americans wouldn't have failed a basic citizenship exam put out by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship. The group surveyed 41,000 Americans on basic questions about American history and government. But why would schools teach civics?
Now, if the fellowship had only given a test on whom Tristan Thompson cheated on Khloe Kardashian with, then many Americans would pass.
Ask people about the release date of "Game of Thrones" Season 8 and they'll know. But ask Americans how a bill is passed, or if abolishing the Electoral College would be the fastest way to destroy the republic and bring us to the brink of "Hunger Games"?
Meh.
Americans do know about becoming victims, though, and having victim status conferred upon them by media.
One thing we know about being a victim is that whatever the transgression or alleged crime, it's not your fault, it's someone else's fault, and they don't like you and therefore, they should pay.
And it helps if you look good on TV.
Muthana is an attractive woman, a seemingly devout Muslim, a mother who speaks in measured, thoughtful tones on TV.
She's a perfect victim, except of course for the stubborn facts of her earlier tweets. Muthana wasn't much concerned about the victim status of Syrian Orthodox Christians when, inside ISIS territory, in the Valley of the Christians, they were told to either convert and abandon their faith, pay a fine or die.
Consider her tweets when she called for American blood.
"Go on drive-bys and spill all of their blood, or rent a big truck and drive all over them," she tweeted in March 2015, as reported by the New York Times.
And that's exactly what some terrorists did, in the U.S. and in Europe.
President Donald Trump has said he doesn't want her in the country. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explained further while doing an interview on WOC Radio in Iowa:
"This is a woman who went online and tried to kill young men and women of the United States of America," Pompeo said. "She advocated for jihad, for people to drive vans across streets here in the United States and kill Americans."
Though Muthana was born in the U.S., the daughter of a diplomat from Yemen, Pompeo and Trump insist she is not an American citizen. It's technical. The courts will decide.
"She's not a U.S. citizen. She has no claim of U.S. citizenship." Pompeo said. "In fact, she's a terrorist, and we shouldn't bring back foreign terrorists to the United States of America."
Her family's lawyer said she'd been brainwashed by ISIS. And she's told reporters it was all a terrible mistake, that she wants to be forgiven.
But how many 19-year-old boys make terrible mistakes, with guns in their hands? Our prisons are full of them.
In Hale's "The Man Without a Country," the traitor Philip Nolan was given the opportunity to address the judges and plead mercy.
"Damn the United States!" Nolan cried. "I wish I may never hear of the United States again!"
His sentence terrified me. He was sentenced to a life at sea, forbidden to set one foot in America, forbidden to see her shores. And while he lived, Nolan was never to hear the words "The United States" again.
He lived a long life. But that's a story. Just like the ISIS bride who has been brainwashed is a story.
Her son is innocent. He should be brought here to be raised by her parents. And I think she's a citizen, since she was born here.
But citizens owe their country something.
I figure she owes 30 years in a federal penitentiary without parole.

Texto completo: CARBONDALE — Honor "Visionary Women" and help support scholarships during Southern Illinois University Carbondale’s 23rd annual "Celebrate Women: Honoring Inclusive Excellence" reception and awards ceremony, Thursday, March 21. The reception is a celebration, an awards presentation and a scholarship fundraiser all rolled into one.
Tickets are now available. The evening celebrates the successes of women both on-campus and in the community while also raising money to fund scholarships to help more women reach their goals.
Retired Lt. Colonel Kate Germano will be the special guest speaker for the event. Germano is the former commander of the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion at Parris Island and she co-authored the book "Fight Like a Girl: The Truth Behind How Female Marines are Trained" with Kelly Kennedy.
Her military career encompassed 20 years of service as a United States Marine Corps officer and combat veteran. When she took command of the Parris Island post, which exclusively trains female recruits, she raised expectations for the women and in response, their shooting qualifications equaled those of men, injuries dropped and morale improved. She was then relieved of her command.
Nevertheless, she continued her fight against reduced expectations for women and has gained national attention for her fight against sexism and bias not only within the military but in other segments of American society, including the government and the education and corporate systems. Her writings on topics such as national security, gender and leadership have been published in a wide variety of national media including The New York Times, Time magazine, U.S. News and World Report and The Washington Post. She has appeared on NPR, Vice News Tonight, C-SPAN and the PBS NewsHour, to name a few.
Germano will share her insights about appreciating different perspectives, backgrounds and beliefs, identifying and removing emotional blocks to communication and community, and improving individual and team results and the organizational structure to build success.
A variety of awards will be presented and recognition will be given to a number of deserving women during the celebration, including annual scholarships presented by the American Association of University Women and the SIU Women’s Club.
There’s a full slate of activities planned that evening at various locations within Morris Library: the rotunda, the Hall of Presidents and Chancellors and the John C. Guyon Auditorium.
The event begins with a silent auction at 4:30 p.m. and runs until 5:45 p.m. The reception, featuring wine and hors d’oeuvres is set for 5-6 p.m. with the awards from 6 to 7 p.m. Only guests 21 and older will be served wine.
Tickets are now available for Celebrate Women. They are $25 each or $15 for SIU students with a valid ID. They can be purchased by contacting Martha Ellert of AAUW at 618/521-0613 or msellert@aol.com.

Kelly, Out of White House, Breaks With Policies of His Former Boss

Texto completo: The former White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, on Wednesday declined to answer questions about the existence of a memo he wrote saying that President Trump had ordered officials to give his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a security clearance in May 2018.
Mr. Kelly also broke with Mr. Trump on key aspects of his approach to immigration and the NATO alliance, and said that his top concern about decisions made by the president was whether they were objectively right for the country when divorced from political concerns.
Mr. Kelly, who kept his voice level during a 90-minute question-and-answer session at Duke University, would not specifically address Mr. Kushner's clearance being ordered by Mr. Trump, which The New York Times reported last week.
"I couldn't -- and I'm not dodging -- I couldn't comment on that for a couple of reasons," Mr. Kelly said, citing clearances being among the things that he could not discuss, and that conversations with the president "at that level would certainly" be kept confidential under executive privilege.
Asked specifically about whether he had ever created memos for the record, Mr. Kelly said, "I'd prefer not to talk about that."
Mr. Trump ordered the chief of staff to get Mr. Kushner a clearance after it stalled for most of the first half of the president's term over concerns from the F.B.I. and career security officials about Mr. Kushner's personal foreign contacts, as well as those related to his family's real-estate business.
Mr. Trump has the legal authority to overrule recommendations from security clearance officials. But his action added to ongoing questions about how people obtained them, and it contradicted a statement at the time from Mr. Kushner's lawyer that his clearance went through a normal process. And the president himself asserted to The Times in an Oval Office interview in January that he had not directed Mr. Kelly or anyone else to grant a clearance.
In his conversation at Duke with Professor Peter Feaver, Mr. Kelly said that his 18 months as the chief of staff were the "least" favorite job he had held, but the most important. He acknowledged that his colleagues in the Marine Corps, where he served as a four-star general, might not like hearing that.
However, Mr. Kelly said, during that time, Mr. Trump "went from a guy who didn't know how the system works" to one "who understands how it works."
Mr. Kelly, who left at the end of December, also made clear he did not consider himself working for Mr. Trump, but doing his civic duty to serve. If Hillary Clinton had won, he said, he probably would have worked for her as well.
Mr. Kelly defended the utility of the NATO alliance, which Mr. Trump has often criticized as an unfair financial drain on the United States.
On a wall at the border with Mexico, Mr. Kelly said that there were specific areas where it could be effective but constructing one "from sea to shining sea" was a "waste of money."
The issuance of the zero-tolerance policy for border crossings that resulted in family separations "came as a surprise" to him and to other officials, Mr. Kelly said, defending his replacement as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, from criticism. He appeared to place most of the blame on the former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who announced the policy.
Of people crossing the border who are apprehended, Mr. Kelly contradicted the president. "They're overwhelmingly not criminals -- they're people coming up here for economic" purposes. Mr. Trump has regularly portrayed immigrants crossing at the southern border as dangerous lawbreakers.
He also joked wryly about the advice he gave his successor, Mick Mulvaney: "Run for it," Mr. Kelly said, to laughter. On a serious note, he said, he told him the chief of staff's job was to tell the president "what he needs to hear."

Heimlich Is Signed By a Team In Mexico

Texto completo: Since the revelation in June 2017 that Luke Heimlich had pleaded guilty for sexually molesting his 6-year-old niece when he was 15, he has gone from a top college pitcher to an entirely shunned one.
All 30 major league teams have passed on drafting or signing Heimlich; the Kansas City Royals considered it last year but backed off when even the mere idea drew backlash.
But a team in the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol decided that Heimlich, now 23, merited an opportunity after serving his punishment and signed the left-hander, who has been throwing as hard as 94 miles per hour recently. During preseason training on Wednesday, , he threw a bullpen session in his new uniform.
It is unclear whether Heimlich, who has said that his criminal record has been expunged, will be able to stick with his new team, the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos. His signing has drawn criticism from the victim's family and a prominent activist, and the Tecolotes might become the second team whose deal with Heimlich has been nixed by their league.
"He's not registered in the league," Javier Salinas, the president of the Mexican league, said in Spanish in a phone interview from Japan, where a contingent of Mexican players were taking part in exhibition games. "We have to analyze his case. It's very difficult to see him registered in the Mexican League."
If he is blocked by the league office, it would not be the first time. In August, the Lamigo Monkeys in Taiwan reached a deal with Heimlich. But after a wave of criticism, the Chinese Professional Baseball League declared that Heimlich could not play there because of his criminal history and the effect on the league's image.
Salinas said that the Mexican league, which is affiliated with Minor League Baseball and is considered Class AAA, had previously rejected players with checkered backgrounds involving problems like doping and gambling.
"The player has to have irreproachable conduct and be a good representative of the team and the league," he said. "Like any league, we have to verify that all of our entrants have good conduct. We are an example to a lot of boys and girls. And we have to protect the image of the league."
José Antonio Mansur, the owner of the Tecolotes, said it was a common practice for the league to have final say on a player's contract. But he added that the league had taken the unusual step of asking Heimlich to sign a letter vowing good behavior, which he did on Wednesday.
"I'm not a judge," Mansur said in Spanish in a phone interview from Laredo, Tex. "I'm just a businessman, and I'll give him an opportunity. If he was guilty, he's already been judged. I'm just looking from here on forward. He has this opportunity, just like any citizen who has made a mistake. Who hasn't tripped up in life and has to get back up?"
Mansur said that a rejection of Heimlich's contract would be discriminatory. Salinas said the league would make a decision "in the coming days."
Last May, in an interview with The New York Times, Heimlich denied that he had committed the crime he admitted to, saying he had pleaded guilty to quickly dispense with the case and for the sake of the family. The girl's mother, whose name is being withheld to protect the identity of the victim, has maintained that her daughter's account is truthful.
As part of a plea deal, reached when Heimlich was 16, one of two charges was dropped, and he was placed on two years' probation, took court-ordered classes, wrote a letter apologizing to his niece and was forced to register for five years as a Level 1 sex offender, a designation the State of Washington uses for someone considered of low risk to the community and unlikely to become a repeat offender. His juvenile records are sealed.
Heimlich's case became public in 2017 when, while playing for Oregon State, he failed to update his whereabouts for a state registry of sex offenders, which led to a police citation. He pitched the next year at Oregon State.
Reached on Wednesday night, Heimlich declined to comment.
The victim's mother was unaware of Heimlich's new job until asked for comment. "My view on the subject has not changed nor will it: I don't believe he deserves a spot on any professional team," she wrote in a text message.
Brenda Tracy, one of Oregon's most prominent victims' rights activists, who frequently speaks about sexual abuse in sports and on college campuses, called Heimlich's signing "really problematic."
"This softens him," she said. "Because someone is giving him a so-called second chance, it is paving the way for a team in Major League Baseball to sign him. They will say, 'Mexico signed him, so we are not the only ones, we were not the first ones to do this,' and that is wrong. It is ignoring the victim, and it is wrong."
She added, "As I've said before, second chances do not have to include playing sports, especially pro sports, because in our society, we put these athletes up on a pedestal."
The Tecolotes, who have an unusual arrangement with home stadiums on both sides of the border, got in touch with Heimlich's agent in January through an intermediary. Talks became more serious last month before an agreement was reached. Mansur said the Tecolotes' front office and coaching staff had watched video of Heimlich from college and of a tryout in front of scouts.
In vetting Heimlich, Mansur said the team had spoken with Heimlich's representatives but not with Heimlich directly, though he said he planned to meet with him later Thursday in camp.
Mansur said he had consulted with his team's lawyers and with his family, which runs the team. He did not speak with the victim or her family, he said, because they had already spoken to investigators and Heimlich had already served his penalty. Mansur said that he was aware that the Tecolotes were opening themselves up to criticism with the signing but that he believed Heimlich should not be punished for life.
"For the fans, I ask that we all analyze ourselves," he said. "This is really a kid who wants to and has decided to move ahead with his life. And like he says, to be an example and to be a good kid. I think he merits our support."
The league, however, may not feel the same way.

Texto completo: Last month, the Supreme Court refused to hear a case involving a libel claim by one of the women who accused comedian Bill Cosby of rape. That's not terribly surprising. Since the Supreme Court's 1964 decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, justices have interpreted the First Amendment to make libel claims very difficult to bring.
If you're a public official — later expanded to include all "public figures," a class that includes football coaches and celebrities generally, and even people who publicly accuse comedians of rape — you can't recover without showing that the libelous statement was made with "actual malice," meaning with knowledge it was false, or with reckless disregard of its falsity.
Even nonpublic figures have to show actual malice to recover punitive or presumed damages. The result is that libel claims are very hard to bring. This is especially true after the Supreme Court's 1968 decision in St. Amant v. Thompson holding that a plaintiff has to show that the defendant entertained serious doubts that what he was publishing was true. Mere failure to investigate isn't enough.
The court based these rules on the First Amendment's protection of free speech and freedom of the press, arguing that the prospect of libel judgments would chill news media's willingness to cover controversial issues.
But although the Supreme Court refused to hear the Cosby case, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the court needs to undo New York Times v. Sullivan on the ground that it was a case of constitutional overreach. As Thomas wrote, "The constitutional libel rules adopted by this court in New York Times and its progeny broke sharply from the common law of libel, and there are sound reasons to question whether the First and 14th Amendments displaced this body of common law."
Justice Thomas would have the court revisit the issue, and possibly overturn Sullivan, arguing that the "actual malice" standard has no support in the Constitution.
Not surprisingly, this was poorly received by the press. Columnist Will Bunch in the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, "Thomas wants to crush the free press just like southern segregationists of the 1950s." A column in the San Francisco Chronicle called it "Clarence Thomas vs. public's right to know." And in the always temperate ThinkProgress, we were told that Thomas has declared war on the free press.
Well. Speaking as a blogger, columnist and occasional reporter, I have to say the Sullivan ruling has been very, very good to me. You have to work pretty hard to commit actionable libel under present law, and like everyone else in the business of writing and speaking and so on, I'm pretty happy with that legal regime. But this doesn't mean Thomas is wrong.
As even liberal law professor Cass Sunstein commented: "Thomas is right to point out that the constitutional foundations of New York Times v. Sullivan are not entirely firm." And it's also true that the case's original holding — in response to a coordinated plan by southern segregationist officials to use libel suits (brought in front of sympathetic local juries) to punish the national press for unfavorable coverage — has been expanded to cover all sorts of other cases, such as Cosby's.
It should be noted that limiting libel claims is essentially a subsidy for the chattering classes and the media. Like all subsidies, the costs come from someone else — in this case, someone whose reputation is ruined and who is left without a remedy. (And people who would perhaps not have been defamed at all if the news media worried more about libel exposure.)
I very much doubt that the Supreme Court will take up Thomas' call to overturn New York Times v. Sullivan. But I would not be surprised to see it cut back on some of the more expansive follow-ups to that decision. The court has never given a convincing reason why "public figures" should be treated the same as "public officials." And the St. Amant holding that there's no duty to do due diligence if you don't suspect anything is wrong is a likely place to start cutting back.
Like Sunstein, I think it's time to start thinking about ways to discourage defamation a bit more, and to provide remedies for people who are harmed. And I would not be surprised to see the Supreme Court go at least a little way down that road.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- WarnerMedia said on Wednesday that it would conduct an "appropriate investigation" into allegations that Kevin Tsujihara, the chief executive of Warner Bros., pushed for a woman with whom he had a sexual relationship to be considered for roles in Warner films and television shows.
The claims surfaced Wednesday in a 4,200-word article in The Hollywood Reporter, which outlined a sexual relationship between Mr. Tsujihara, 54, and Charlotte Kirk, an aspiring British actress in her 20s. The account, quoting from private text messages obtained by The Reporter, portrays a situation in which Mr. Tsujihara -- prompted by Ms. Kirk's statements that he had promised to help her career during a meeting at a motel -- reaches out to his lieutenants on her behalf.
"I just need to be careful," Mr. Tsujihara, who is married, said in a 2014 text message, according to the trade magazine. "Let's look for a movie role." In an exchange from 2015, Ms. Kirk wrote, "Are u going to help me like u said u would?" He responded, "Richard will be reaching out to u tonight," a reference to Richard Brener, president of Warner's New Line division.
The disclosure appeared two days after AT&T, which owns WarnerMedia, publicly praised Mr. Tsujihara and added children's television, including the Cartoon Network, to his portfolio.
"Whenever we receive new allegations, it is our standard practice to conduct an appropriate investigation," WarnerMedia said in its statement on Wednesday. "And that is what we will do here."
A lawyer for Mr. Tsujihara said in an email that his client "did not have a direct role in the actress being cast in any movie."
Ms. Kirk's résumé includes bit parts in two Warner films: "Ocean's 8," which was released last year, and "How to Be Single," released by New Line in 2016. In a statement, Ms. Kirk said, "Mr. Tsujihara never promised me anything." She added, "I emphatically deny any inappropriate behavior" by Mr. Tsujihara.
Whispers about Mr. Tsujihara's alleged conduct have circulated in Hollywood for over a year, ever since the #MeToo movement gained momentum, ensnaring men like Brett Ratner, a producer and financier with whom Mr. Tsujihara was once close. The Reporter article, written by Tatiana Siegel and Kim Masters, also detailed text messages between Ms. Kirk and Mr. Ratner involving Mr. Tsujihara and acting roles. Mr. Ratner has denied accusations of sexual misconduct made by multiple women.
In September, John Stankey, the chief executive of WarnerMedia, was sent an email from an anonymous account (reporters from 11 publications, including The New York Times, were copied) asking whether an actress had been offered speaking roles in films in exchange for silence about sex with a senior executive. At the time, Mr. Stankey enlisted the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson to look into the claims.
On Wednesday, WarnerMedia said, "The actress has publicly denied any impropriety in her casting, and our prior investigation did not find otherwise."
Mr. Tsujihara has been chief executive of Warner Bros. since 2013. One of his biggest achievements was persuading J. K. Rowling to expand the Harry Potter movie universe with a series of "Fantastic Beasts" spinoffs.
Warner Bros. is Hollywood's leading producer of television shows, with a stable that includes "Young Sheldon," "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" and "Westworld." On the movie side, Warner racked up worldwide ticket sales of $5.6 billion last year, a record for the company that reflected hits like "Aquaman," "A Star Is Born," "The Meg" and "Crazy Rich Asians."

Operation Led by U.A.E. Freed American Hostage in Yemen

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- An American hostage who was freed in Yemen in February after nearly 18 months in captivity was rescued in an armed raid led by the United Arab Emirates with help from the United States, according to American and Yemeni officials.
The hostage, Danny Lavone Burch, had been held by a criminal Yemeni gang with a record of kidnapping Westerners for ransom. The gang was known to sell hostages to a powerful local affiliate of Al Qaeda, the officials said.
President Trump hosted Mr. Burch at the White House on Wednesday, crediting his release as a result of "great help from U.A.E. and all of our friends." The president did not provide details, but also said Mr. Burch's rescue was one of "a few negotiations" worldwide to free Americans held captive.
"Gosh, it's great to be an American," Mr. Burch told a small group of American officials and journalists in the Oval Office.
"This is the end result: a happy man with a happy family," Mr. Trump said.

More than a half-dozen American and Yemeni officials described parts of the rescue operation on the condition of anonymity.
Mr. Burch was retrieved from a cellar where he was being held in a lawless part of Yemen. One senior Yemeni official said seven people were arrested in the raid.
There were conflicting accounts of which military force led the raid. Some officials said it was Emirati special forces. A senior Yemeni official said the raid was coordinated by the emirates but executed by the Hadrami Elite Forces, a Yemeni special forces group that operates under Emirati command.
Mr. Burch was born in Texas and worked for a Yemeni state oil company. He had been living in Yemen since the 1990s, converted to Islam and married a Yemeni woman. He was snatched outside a restaurant in Sana, the Yemeni capital, in September 2017 as he drove his children to a swimming pool.
A week later, a security agency controlled by the Houthi rebels who control Sana blamed the abduction on a gang led by Ali Nasser Huraiqidan, a tribal criminal notorious for kidnapping foreigners for ransom.
An internal Yemeni report on the kidnapping, which was obtained by The New York Times, was based on the interrogation of two gang members who were said to have returned to Sana after driving Mr. Burch to Marib, an oil-rich province east of the capital.
The report said the kidnappers "represent a dangerous criminal gang involved in kidnapping, road blocking and armed robbery."
Former American officials said the gang had signaled it wanted millions of dollars for Mr. Burch's safe release. It was feared, the former officials said, that the gang was going sell Mr. Burch to Al Qaeda in Yemen.
In recent years, Mr. Huraiqidan has been accused of holding a Norwegian aid worker, an Italian diplomat and a German official. Mr. Huraiqidan usually held his victims in Marib, where he lives in a fortified compound. During his captivity, the German official was interviewed by a reporter with a local television channel.
An elderly man in Yemeni clothes, the German appealed to the reporter for his release in broken Arabic, saying he was suffering from cancer. Also in the interview, a masked Mr. Huraiqidan demanded a ransom and threatened to hand the German to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which American intelligence agencies view as one of the group's most lethal affiliates.
For much of last year, American officials hoped to negotiate for Mr. Burch's freedom.
A senior tribesman in Marib said negotiations began last year after two visits to the province by American diplomats, including the United States ambassador to Yemen, Matthew H. Tueller. A State Department spokeswoman in Washington declined to comment.
People familiar with his kidnapping said Mr. Burch was moved several times from one heavily guarded compound to another. Any rescue, they said, would have involved a firefight.
One United States official said the C.I.A. played a role in the rescue operation but gave no details. American Special Forces were not involved, a second United States official said. A spokesman for the United Arab Emirates declined to comment.

The raid was a potentially risky gambit for Mr. Trump.
In January 2017, just days into his presidency, Mr. Trump ordered a botched American Special Operations raid in Yemen that led to the death of a member of the Navy SEALs, Chief Petty Officer William Ryan Owens. The dead sailor's father, Bill Owens, later criticized the operation as "a screw-up from the start that ended badly."
And in December 2014, an American commando raid failed to rescue the American photojournalist Luke Somers, who was being held hostage by Al Qaeda in southern Yemen. The kidnappers killed Mr. Somers and a South African who was being held with him.
Kidnapping for ransom has for decades been a hazard for foreign visitors to Yemen, where the practice was in many cases just a source of income for criminal or tribal groups. But in the past decade it has become far more dangerous because of the presence of Qaeda and Islamic State groups in the war-torn country.
Army Sgt. Maj. Cale Burch, one of Danny Burch's children from a previous marriage, said the F.B.I. notified him the day before Trump announced that his father had been freed. Mr. Burch said he spoke on Friday with his father, who was in the emirates.
"He's doing great," said Mr. Burch, who was deployed overseas. His father told him that he was not physically abused but suffered a lot of psychological stress.
"I was concerned for his physical safety, but he's a tough old guy," the son said. "Our family is really relieved he is safe."

Giuliani: Pardons sought by lawyers in Trump investigation

Texto completo: President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said lawyers whose clients are involved in the Justice Department investigation into Trump have approached him seeking pardons.

Giuliani told the New York Times on Wednesday that despite the lawyers’ inquiries about presidential pardons, he has maintained that Trump would not consider granting pardons until long after investigations into them had concluded.

“I always gave one answer and they always left disappointed,” Giuliani said. He did not disclose which attorneys asked about the pardons.

The topic was broached during discussions about Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations related to hush-money payments to two women who alleged affairs with Trump as well as lying to Congress, is currently being investigated by committees in the House and Senate into whether he had discussions about a presidential pardon, the Washington Post reported over the weekend.

A number of individuals and entities are currently under investigation by the Department of Justice, with their ties to Trump and his 2016 presidential campaign under scrutiny. Dozens have been indicted in the wide-ranging investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Texto completo: I know for an absolute fact that if only 50 percent of what Michael Cohen told Congress under oath is true, than Donald Trump is by far the most corrupt individual ever to occupy the Oval Office.

I know for an absolute fact that Raymond L. Wallace, the harmless prankster who created the Big Foot hoax back in 1958, and who died in 2003, would love that thousands of people still traipse around the Northwest woods every year looking for his nonexistent creation, while Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the now de-licensed British doctor who started the autism vaccination hoax in 1998 by falsifying the results of his medical research, deserves to have received a life sentence for all the harm his still believed fraudulent study has inflicted on thousands of innocent children.

I know for an absolute fact that until he walked up the steps of Air Force One this past Monday, there was at least a 50-50 possibility that President Donald Trump would suffer a 1960s flashback, and refuse to go to Vietnam because of a sudden recurrence of his infamous 1968 "bone spurs" dodge, which helped him avoid service during that long ago war.

I know for an absolute fact that 26 former elected Republican congressmen and senators and 58 former national-security officials were spot on in advising Congress to reject the bogus claim that there is a national emergency taking place along the southern border of the U.S.

I know for an absolute fact that the fabulous Pew Research Center recently revealed a survey that showed it was stress and anxiety and not drugs or bullying that were the chief concerns among our nation's teens.

I know for an absolute fact that the largest health-care conglomerates and the most powerful Insurance companies are girding their loins in an effort to kill any Medicare-for-all initiative.

I know for an absolute fact that despite their best and most aggressive efforts, large news organizations like the New York Times, the Washington Post, and my old employer, Bloomberg News are often stonewalled by the White House press office in their efforts to get even the most tepid reaction to a major news story of the day, in part so the White House can label it unfair, inaccurate, or fake news.

I know for an absolute fact that the thing that Adolf Hitler dreaded most was comedian Charlie Chaplin mocking him in the movies, and the thing that Donald Trump's hates most is Saturday Night Live making fun of him on television. The point: authoritarian figures are more afraid of people laughing at them than anything else.

I know for an absolute fact that very, very soon the federal courts will rule that everyone who works for the Trump White House can no longer be forced into signing illegal NDA's (non-disclosure agreements) as a condition of employment.

I know for an absolute fact that that there is no wall currently being built by this administration on the southern border of the U.S., or on the northern border of the U.S., nor will there be there any wall built on either border any time soon.

I know for an absolute fact that the saddest and dumbest thing the Trump administration has done in its two-plus years in office is not there recent bizarre North Korean giveaway deal in which Kim Jong-un got everything he wanted and we got nothing in return, but rather the new Trump Ad Hoc anti-science/anti-global warming commission made up of people the rest of the world considers kooks and outcasts.

I know for an absolute fact that Donald Trump knows the Mueller Report is merely the tip of the iceberg and his worst days in the court of public opinion are ahead of him.

Finally, I know for an absolute fact that Donald Trump's recent pronouncement that he is planning a large fireworks display at the Lincoln Memorial on Fourth of July, 2019, with himself as the keynote speaker means that Washington will most likely be a virtual ghost town this July 4 for the first time in decades.

Texto completo: NEW YORK – A state regulator has subpoenaed an insurance provider for The Trump Organization, opening a new front in the widening investigations focused on President Donald Trump, his business, family, and White House administration.
Aon, a London-headquartered financial services company that is one of the world's largest insurance brokerages, said it was served a subpoena on Monday by the New York Department of Financial Services.
Donna Mirandola, Aon's vice president of global content marketing, confirmed the subpoena. The insurance brokerage intends to cooperate with the request but would not "comment on specific client matters," she said in an email response.
Another person with knowledge of the subpoena confirmed that the request sought records of communications involving Aon, Trump and his company, as well as internal documents for related insurance coverage. The person declined to be named because the subpoena had not been disclosed publicly.
A spokeswoman for The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
The New York action, combined with moves by the Democratically controlled House, represents the latest in a series of new investigations that could target Trump through the second half of his White House term.
News about the subpoena, first reported by The New York Times, comes less than a week after former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen testified at a congressional hearing that his ex-boss inflated the value of his financial assets to obtain more favorable insurance rates and loans from banks.
Separately, the House Judiciary Committee on Monday requested records from 81 "agencies, entities and individuals" linked to the Republican presidential administration along with Trump's family members, present and former associates and his private businesses.
Additionally, the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday announced new hires, including a former federal prosecutor with expertise in battling Russian organized crime.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who chairs the panel, has signaled plans to continue an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Criticizing the new investigations, Trump tweeted on Tuesday that Democratic House committee chairs "have gone stone cold CRAZY" and "won't get ANYTHING done for our Country!"
Special Counsel Robert Mueller also is focused on Russian interference with the presidential election; his report could be imminent.
Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have investigated Cohen, hush money payments to women who said they had sexual affairs with Trump, and other matters.
The New York regulator is part of the administration of Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent Trump critic.
The Department of Financial Services oversees all insurance companies that do business in New York, as well as many banks, credit unions and consumer credit reporting agencies.
The regulator does not have review authority over Trump or his business, nor does it have prosecutorial power. However, the regulator can refer findings to law enforcement authorities.

Documentary clouding Michael Jackson’s legacy

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Can the memory of Michael Jackson survive “Leaving Neverland”?
After all, it has bounced back before. The superstar’s image was tarnished by allegations of sexual abuse that shadowed him throughout much of his adult life and even stood trial on child molestation charges in 2005, for which he was acquitted. His untimely death in 2009 seemed to wash that stain away in an outpouring of public love and a resurgence of sales of his always popular music.
Now, 10 years later, the HBO documentary “Leaving Neverland” has aired detailed and disturbing stories from two men who say Jackson groomed them for sex and molested them when they were just little boys.
It has cast a spotlight on Jackson’s unsavory history at a #MeToo moment when old allegations against stars have been taking hold, and taking them down.
So far, there has been no evidence of major damage to Jackson’s music or his estate, which has made an estimated $2 billion since his death. His music has been featured in commercials and is the subject of a Cirque Du Soleil show in Las Vegas. A play about his life by Pulitzer Prize-winner Lynn Nottage is due out on Broadway next year.
And it may not. After all, Jackson is dead now, which means he can’t be charged or put on trial, keeping the story in the headlines for months or years to come.
And there is Jackson’s nearly unparalleled star status — starting out as a cherub-faced 11-year-old sensation with the Jackson 5, then catapulting into a global phenomenon with the world’s best-selling album of all time, “Thriller,” to his credit and hits adored by multiple generations.
“It’s hard to compare someone of Michael Jackson’s caliber to anyone else,” said Danny Deraney, a publicist who often handles crisis management. “I don’t think we’ve seen anything like it.”
Still, Oprah Winfrey, with her vast influence, may have heralded a shift in public attitudes just by hosting the special “After Neverland,” in which she interviewed the documentary’s subjects, James Safechuck and Wade Robson.
“I hope we can get beyond Michael Jackson the icon, stop staring into the sun, and do what is necessary to help our children and ourselves,” Winfrey said in front of an audience of sexual abuse survivors and their supporters.
She did not directly condemn Jackson. But she praised the film, treated its assertions as truth, and said that she was expecting an earful from Jackson’s defenders.
“I’m gonna get it,” Winfrey, who interviewed Jackson before the allegations emerged in 1993 and his family after his death, said at the end of the show that aired Sunday and Monday on HBO and OWN just after the documentary.
And she did. Even before the special taped, she was subject to fierce criticism by some who left disparaging comments on her social media account.
It could be that Jackson’s fandom is so pervasive, especially in countries that don’t follow his personal news closely, that the documentary and renewed allegations will just make a small dent.
“For Michael Jackson’s fans, more so probably outside of America, I don’t think it will have an effect, because they’ll ride or die with Michael,” Deraney said.
Robson and Safechuck’s allegations didn’t emerge until 2013, when they filed lawsuits seeking money from Jackson’s estate that have since been thrown out and are under appeal. Both men had previously denied Jackson sexually abused them and had been among his fiercest defenders when Jackson was alive, but say having their own children and Jackson’s death led them to confront their truth.
Because of the men’s past denials, some Jackson fans have dismissed their testimonies as lies, motivated by money. Some even refused to watch the documentary. Still, after the film began airing, there were casual fans who felt gutted by the revelations, with some saying they could not listen to his music the same way — if at all.
“People have already made the decision one way or the other,” Deraney said. “I think when a lot of people think of Michael Jackson they already think ‘pedophile,’ whether or not there is any proof.”
“I think what it comes down to,” Deraney added, “is future generations.”
Many millennials have only vague knowledge of the Jackson accusations, and are shocked even by facts that are acknowledged by both sides.
“I’m young enough to have not been aware of the allegations about Michael Jackson as they were happening,” 31-year-old New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie tweeted while watching the documentary. “It is WILD TO ME that anyone thought his behavior around and constant contact with young boys was remotely okay.”
Some of Jackson’s fellow artists have indicated they will not give him and his influence up easily, and say they can separate the performer from the person.
Jason Derulo recently released the first music and videos from a planned boxed set of EPs that the singer and dancer made in tribute to Jackson. It’s set to be released in its entirety on June 25, the 10th anniversary of Jackson’s death.
“Michael was the sole reason I started singing and dancing, so this was a way for me to give back,” Derulo, who has not seen “Leaving Neverland,” told The Associated Press. “I started this project because of my love of the performer that Michael Jackson is and the influence that he had on my life as the best performer that ever lived. This has nothing to do with anyone’s personal life.”
India.Arie says it was right to speak out against R. Kelly, who faces new sexual abuse charges after the Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” aired more than a decade after he was cleared of child pornography charges. But Jackson’s situation is different, the singer said.
“I think it’s too late for people to be saying ‘mute Michael Jackson,”’ Arie told the AP.
“With R. Kelly there’s video,” she said, referencing a sex tape that allegedly shows the singer’s abuse. “With Michael Jackson, there’s a lot of speculation. I don’t know if it’s going to go as far. ... Not because we love him more, I just think it’s a different situation.”
Jackson’s estate, his most ardent fans, and his family, have no such ambiguity in their views. They say the documentary repeats discredited allegations from admitted liars.
Jackson’s brothers said they were already in a rough period of managing his memory and legacy with their father Joseph Jackson’s death last year, when they heard that “Leaving Neverland” was coming.
“This time is difficult for us because you know Michael, coming up on the 10th anniversary of his passing and my father passed away six months ago,” Marlon Jackson told the AP last week. “So those things are still there, and you never get rid of them. You learn to live with them. And now we’re dealing with something that’s totally different but has no truth to it. There’s no facts at all.”
At least one prominent and formerly devoted fan says he’s been forced to reconsider.
“I’ve spent a lifetime loving MJ,” Los Angeles Times music writer Gerrick D. Kennedy wrote after seeing the documentary’s premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.
“Roughly an hour into ‘Leaving Neverland,’ it felt like my chest had caved in .... It wasn’t long before I accepted that ‘Leaving Neverland’ would force me – and likely many others who also feel a deep connection to Jackson’s work – to see that none of us really knew him. And that maybe we’d been avoiding the truth.”
The subjects of the documentary themselves don’t have strong feelings about whether people should give up Jackson’s music.
“It’s a chance to reevaluate who you want to be your idols,” Safechuck told the AP at Sundance. “Because you can write a song, does that mean you should be people’s moral compass? ... It’s less about tearing down somebody and more about an opportunity of who do we want to look up to.”
“There’s plenty of other amazing people to fill that role.”

Texto completo: Judge allows preservation of more records in Spacey case
NANTUCKET, Mass. - A judge has approved a request by attorneys for Kevin Spacey to preserve more phone records in the sexual assault case against the
Oscar-winning actor.
The Nantucket District Court judge on Monday allowed a motion to extend an earlier order preserving phone and electronic records between the alleged victim and his former girlfriend until the end of 2017.
Spacey did not attend the hearing and was not required to be there.
The 59-year-old former "House of Cards" star is charged with sexually assaulting the then-18-year-old son of a former Boston TV anchor on Nantucket in 2016.
Spacey pleaded not guilty in January to felony indecent assault and battery. His lawyers have called the accusations "patently false."
It's the first criminal case brought against Spacey after several sexual misconduct allegations crippled his career in 2017.
Ryan Adams' tour canceled after misconduct allegations
NEW YORK - Singer Ryan
Adams' upcoming tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland is canceled following reports of psychological abuse and sexual misconduct.
The cancellation comes after The New York Times recently reported the misconduct allegations against Adams made by multiple women, including his ex-wife Mandy Moore. Seven women have claimed Adams offered to help them with their music careers but then turned things sexual, sometimes becoming verbally abusive. Adams has denied the accusations.
SJM Concerts says full refunds to ticketholders from authorized outlets will be processed by the end of the day Monday. Purchasers should allow time for the transaction to appear in their accounts.
The 44-year-old musician's tour was scheduled to begin March 30.
$500K in items taken from rapper's vehicle at Cracker Barrel
FAIRBURN, Ga. - Police say Tennessee rapper Young Dolph had about $500,000 in jewelry and cash stolen from his custom camouflage Mercedes that was parked outside of a restaurant in Georgia.
Fairburn police said the rapper, whose real name is Adolph Thornton, was eating lunch at the Fulton County restaurant last week when the theft happened. Assistant Police Chief Anthony Bazydlo said surveillance video shows the suspects approach Thornton's car and possibly enter it without breaking into it.
The video then shows the suspects drive off and twice return to the vehicle before smashing one of its windows. The police report says the passenger window was broken.
Police say Thornton reported 11 items stolen, including a gun, Apple Airpods and a Richard Mille watch valued at $230,000.

Grassley calls for more transparency on drug pricing. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview with the Washington Examiner that he didn’t want to point the finger only at drug companies for the high prices of medicines, even while acknowledging they could do more to lower list prices. “Yes,” he said of whether drug companies could do more, adding, “but I don’t want to point the finger just at them, because we’ve got a lot of other players in the game.” He noted that the committee would next be holding hearings with pharmaceutical benefit managers, the middlement that negotiate the ultimate cost of drugs, and that have been accused of not passing on savings to patients. “There’s too much secrecy in price fixing,” Grassley concluded. “We need more transparency and I think with more transparency the marketplace will work better. I think the whole idea is to take some of the secrecy out of it. I think we’re going to have some legislation,” he said, adding that the committee would also be supportive of actions by the Trump administration.

Short-term plans are attractive to older customers: Survey. Older customers are more likely to consider short-term health insurance as an affordable alternative to Obamacare plans, shows a survey out this morning by eHealth. In all, 70 percent of respondents who were between the ages of 55 to 64 said that affordability was their top reason for choosing a short-term plan, compared with 53 percent of adults ages 18 to 24 who reported affordability as the main reason. The Trump administration allows people to have the plans for up to three years. They do not cover the same range of medical care as Obamacare plans and are allowed to turn down customers with pre-existing illnesses. Under Obamacare, health insurance companies are allowed to charge older customers as much as three times what they charge younger customers. Obamacare also allows people to remain on a parents’ plan until age 26.


Kentucky governor says it's 'insane' to have to ask feds to make changes to Medicaid. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin on Friday decried  that states have to ask the federal government for permission to make changes to the Medicaid program that covers poor and disabled people. "The idea that you even have to go to [the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services], that you have to do 'Mother may I?' to get waivers and exceptions ... that you come up with a good idea, and you have to go beg and ask permission to be able to try a good idea at the local level, is insane to me," said Bevin, a Republican, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md. Bevin also pushed back on critics of Kentucky’s upcoming work requirements in Medicaid, noting, as he has before, that he had grown up poor and without any access to healthcare. He concluded the 20-hour-a-week requirement was "not too much to ask." "I am not coming at this from sympathy, it's from empathy," he said. "I understand that world and I understand this: There is dignity in work, there is dignity in doing for oneself and there is dignity in being given that opportunity and the expectation that we seize that opportunity in order to make our own versions of the American dream come true. The liberals who look down on people like I was, and so many are still, I consider that a level of bigotry that's not acceptable."


Kellyanne Conway stresses destigmatizing opioid addiction. Senior White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway stressed the need to take shame out of seeking recovery from opiate addiction Thursday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. Conway said that the influx of opiates in the United States is not only a public health emergency, but an attack on kids and families. “Well first, you’re not alone. We see you. We hear you. And we’re with you,” Conway says to families and victims of addiction. “The best thing you can do is break through the stigma and the silence… This is a bigger killer now than cancer.” President Trump, Conway said, is fully dedicated to stemming the flow of drugs into communities nationwide and assisting those who need those resources.


E+C leaders demand justification for Title X ‘gag rule.’ Democratic leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee are demanding justification for Trump’s Title X gag rule in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. “We have serious concerns regarding the final rule’s compliance with the Title X statute, the public health implications of this action, and the administration’s rationale for these changes,” they wrote. “Additionally, we have questions about the Department’s expansive claim of authority under this rule, HHS’s failure to account for the significant costs created as a result of the final rule, and the internal regulatory process used by the Department to review and finalize this rule,” they continued. The Trump administration made new rules in February on Title X, which provides grants to family planning. The rules would block doctors from referring for abortions for the purpose of family planning and would obligate clinics to keep abortion services in a separate building from other family planning services.

I don’t believe Michael Jackson’s accusers in ‘Leaving Neverland’

Texto completo: Every major advance review of HBO’s "Leaving Neverland" gave the impression that audiences would invariably come away from watching it convinced that Michael Jackson sexually abused little boys. That’s not what happened for me.

In fact, after watching, I disbelieve the two men in the documentary. It isn't hard.

The first half of the film aired Sunday night. It recounts the allegations of Wade Robson, now 36, and James Safechuck, who is 41. Both were friends of Jackson in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and both now say that Jackson kissed them, masturbated in front of them, and engaged in oral sex with them.

The allegations aren’t new. Both men several years ago filed lawsuits against the Jackson estate for their supposed abuse. Their claims were dismissed because of the statute of limitations under California law.

Both men had also in the past stated under oath that Jackson never behaved inappropriately. Safechuck made his statement when he was still a child during the 1993 sexual abuse trial against Jackson, which was ultimately settled out of court.

But Robson’s situation is even more bizarre. He, like Safechuck, said in 1993 that he was never abused by Jackson. He was a child then as well but even as an adult, he testified a second time that there was no misconduct. In the 2005 trial against Jackson, again, for sexual abuse, Robson was in his early 20s. Under oath, and presumably sitting before a plaintiff who had accused Jackson of sexual abuse, he again said that that Jackson had not molested him.

You can imagine that a child, in shame and fear, would refuse to admit he had been inappropriately fondled. It's even reasonable to imagine adults keeping silent out of the same fear or shame. But why would he go to the length of testifying falsely on Jackson's behalf in court, under oath , and then continue to maintain that position right up until it was too late to make a real difference?

From the 2005 court transcript:

Counsel: “Mr. Robson, did Michael Jackson ever molest you at any time?”
Robson: “Absolutely not.”
Counsel: “Mr. Robson, did Michael Jackson ever touch you in a sexual way?”
Robson: “Never, no.”

“Leaving Neverland,” isn’t the soul-shaking experience that critics claim it is. If not for journalists still enthralled by the #MeToo movement, it wouldn’t even register.

It’s supposed to be OK to hate Michael Jackson now. He’s dead and he can no longer defend himself. Besides, settling the score on old sexual abuse claims is all the rage. (See “Harvey Weinstein,” et al.) But the media have mistaken the #MeToo movement for a blanket of justice where every accusation of sexual misconduct is presumed true. They can't all be true.

Like the accusations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh — he was in a rape gang! — the ones against Jackson in "Leaving Neverland" are as believable as you want them to be.

New York Times critic Wesley Morris scandalized readers with a Feb. 28 review, describing a scene in the documentary where Safechuck displays jewelry that he says was given to him by Jackson. “[T]here’s something about the way the filmmakers reserve this scene for the back end of Part 1 that ices your bones, something about the way an adult Safechuck doesn’t seem to want to go back there,” wrote Morris. “But here he is, talking in a TV documentary about the vows he says that he and Jackson exchanged. Here he is, forlorn, holding the ring that he’s kept, all this time, in a handsome box.”

That description did not at all match the scene that viewers were ultimately treated to on Sunday. Safechuck pulled out a box of jewelry. Though he says he doesn’t like looking at it, it’s clear that he cherishes it. He hasn’t let it go in more than 30 years. Why would he? After all, it was only given to him by the man that Safechuck says masturbated while watching him naked, bent over on all fours.

Assume that the jewelry really was given to him by Jackson. I don’t buy that he “doesn’t seem to want to go back there.” In fact, throughout the documentary, it’s clear that both Safechuck and Bronson do want to “go back there.” They recall at length being friends with the biggest star the world has ever seen, the perks of being so close to Michael Jackson.

They both discussed how they were flown around the world to appear with him on stage during his concerts. Robson was in Jackson's music videos. Safechuck was featured in one of his iconic Pepsi commercials. Both men recount their friendships with Jackson in vivid, exciting detail: the hotels, the flights, the life.

It’s only when they describe the coming end of their time with Jackson that they seem upset.

They're wistful. They remember no longer feeling like they were his “favorite."

I don’t believe Robson or Safechuck.

“Leaving Neverland” doesn’t look like an expose on sexual abuse. It looks like a break-up story, with additional accusations thrown in and legitimized by the #MeToo era.

Texto completo: President Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last week was criticized by both parties in Washington long before Air Force One even touched down in Hanoi. Washington’s political class seemed terrified that the nearly 70 year state of “war” with North Korea might actually end. In the end the only positive thing they could say about the meeting was that Trump apparently walked away with nothing to show for it.
The location of the meeting – Hanoi, Vietnam – serves as a great example of what can be won in peace versus what is lost in war. After losing nearly 60,000 US service members in an unnecessary war that took a million Vietnamese lives, the US loss of the Vietnam war resulted not in a communist takeover of southeast Asia but something very different: the domino theory failed because communism was destined to fail. Now we are close trading partners with an increasingly pro-market Vietnam. The result of trade and exchange versus war is a better life for all.
Unfortunately for Washington, the real lesson of Vietnam has not been learned. That is why the Republicans, Democrats, and the entire mainstream media spoke as one against President Trump’s decision to take a bold step and actually meet again, one-on-one, with one of our “enemies” to see if we can avoid nuclear conflict.
One leading Democrat, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), attacked Trump for meeting with Kim because speaking to the North Korean “gives him legitimacy.” Does it make any sense that we should not even speak with our nuclear-armed adversaries because it gives them “legitimacy”? He’d rather have a nuclear war as long as Kim remains “illegitimate”? This is sadly the kind of thinking that prevails in Washington.
The media reported that Trump walked away from the meeting before the scheduled signing ceremony and closing press event. The talks broke down, it was reported, because Kim demanded an end to all sanctions before any reduction in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. Washington sighed with relief and said all together, “better no deal than a bad deal.”
Meanwhile the North Koreans held a rare press conference clarifying that they only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling one of their main nuclear facilities. Further, press reports began to surface that National Security Advisor John Bolton threw additional demands on the table which led Kim to draw the meeting to an early close.
Who’s telling the truth? We likely won’t know. But given Bolton’s strong opposition to any kind of peace agreement with North Korea it’s hard to doubt that he had something to do with the blow-up of the summit. As the New York Times reported over the weekend, while Trump’s advisors were shocked when he decided to meet Kim face-to-face the first time for negotiations, John Bolton wasn’t worried at all. As the Times writes, “Mr. Bolton told colleagues not to worry. The negotiations, he said, would collapse on their own.” And so they did.
Will Trump continue to allow his diplomatic efforts to be undermined by his own staff? Let’s hope the president will ignore Washington, ignore the neocons, and continue to work for peace with North Korea.

A 5G Proxy Battle at Global Tech Conference

Texto completo: Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.
Hello, Adam Satariano here, back from Barcelona, where the MWC Barcelona tech conference, formerly called Mobile World Congress, just wrapped up.
An event celebrating new bendable smartphones, augmented-reality goggles and internet-connected beer kegs would seem an unlikely base for an important geopolitical standoff. But that was what happened in the Spanish city this past week, when members of the Trump administration attended MWC to try to persuade other countries to ban the Chinese technology company Huawei.
You're forgiven if you have not kept up with the deluge of news regarding the Huawei fight. It's a complicated, fast-moving and often-technical story.
In short, the White House has been trying for a year to get allies, particularly in Europe, to impose bans against using Huawei equipment inside the new wireless networks, known as 5G, that will become available starting this year. 5G is seen as critical infrastructure for a quickly digitizing economy, increasing phone data speeds but also creating new opportunities in robotics, transportation, manufacturing and artificial intelligence.
The United States says using Huawei equipment in the new networks will create a grave vulnerability that the Chinese government will exploit. It's a dramatic and worrying accusation -- if true. But the Trump administration hasn't provided much hard evidence.
In Barcelona, I met in a hotel lobby with a frustrated executive from one of Europeʼs biggest carriers who said the United States had presented no new details to support its accusations.
Instead, American officials have tried to gain support by rehashing China's history of cyber misbehavior and President Xi Jinping's increasing control over the Chinese economy.
This executive's frustration may explain why the White House effort has lost momentum in recent weeks. British intelligence officials recently indicated that a ban wasn't necessary, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Germany shared that view.
At MWC, the White House sent a team from the State, Commerce and Defense Departments, as well as the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, to make the case against Huawei.
Nobody appeared to be won over. Vodafoneʼs chief executive, Nick Read, defended Huawei at a news conference, repeating a not-so-subtle swipe at the United States that criticism of Huawei wasn't "fact based." Officials in the United Arab Emirates, a typically reliable American ally in the Middle East, seemed to agree. On Monday, just as MWC was starting, the country's state-owned wireless carrier announced a deal with Huawei to build the 5G network there.
Perhaps sensing a momentum shift, Huawei has ratcheted up its opposition to the American campaign. On Monday, a Huawei executive, Vincent Peng, said cybersecurity was a "technical challenge, not a political challenge." The next morning, Guo Ping, the company's rotating chairman, said the United States had a more checkered history of espionage than Huawei, referring to the whistle-blower Edward J. Snowden's disclosures in 2013 of an internet surveillance program by American spy agencies and their allies.
Huawei is a relatively boring company. While it has branched out to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of smartphones, it primarily makes the gear needed to make phone networks work. It's the kind of infrastructure people rely upon but don't give much thought.
But the debate is worth following. Huawei foreshadows conflicts about important emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, in which China is developing an expertise that the United States and its allies are likely to view as an economic and security threat.
In other news:
■ The other week, I averaged three hours and 12 minutes of screen time per day. I feel somewhat proud of this figure, pathetically, because it was down from some of my more frightening recent averages, which occasionally topped -- not sure I should admit this -- five hours. Kevin Roose described his detox experience in a memorable column about how we can assert control over our digital lives. I have a long way to go.
■ Life is even worse than we thought for Facebook moderators who are paid $15 an hour to review the internet's most horrific material. After Casey Newton's must-read investigation was published this past week in The Verge, I like the idea that all Facebook employees should have to spend a month doing this job.
■ Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, the United States blocked internet access to the Russian group behind many of the online misinformation campaigns targeted at Americans, The Washington Post reported, saying it "was part of the first offensive cybercampaign against Russia designed to thwart attempts to interfere with a U.S. election."
■ And finally, if you thought cryptocurrencies were so 2018, guess again. My colleagues Nathaniel Popper and Mike Isaac reported that big internet messaging companies like Facebook and Telegram were working on their own digital coins.

Texto completo: A dual citizen of Saudi Arabia and the United States had been imprisoned in the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh for about a week when he heard a knock on his door.
Guards dragged Walid Fitaihi, a Harvard-trained physician, to another room, according to a friend who took down the prisoner's detailed account of his treatment. Dr. Fitaihi told the friend he was slapped, blindfolded, stripped to his underwear and bound to a chair. He was shocked with electricity in what appears to have been a single session of torture that lasted about an hour.
His tormentors whipped his back so severely that he could not sleep on it for days, his friend said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals. The doctor had described the physical abuse, in general terms, to his relatives as well, a person close to them said.
Detained in November 2017 in what was billed as a crackdown on corruption, Dr. Fitaihi, 54, remains imprisoned without any public charges or trial. About 200 prominent Saudis were detained with him, and he is one of dozens who remain in prison.
Friends and families of others detained have also described episodes of torture. At least 17 detainees were hospitalized soon after the crackdown for injuries sustained while in custody, according to a doctor at the hospital and an American official monitoring the crackdown.
A military officer who had been detained died with a twisted neck and other signs of abuse on his body, according to a person who saw it. Women's rights advocates jailed in Saudi Arabia have said they were also tortured, including by electrical shocks, according to their relatives and rights groups.
But Dr. Fitaihi's American citizenship means that his mistreatment, which has not been previously reported, may now pose a special threat to Saudi relations with Washington. The Trump administration is already struggling to quell a bipartisan backlash against the kingdom over the killing last fall of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist who was executed and dismembered by a team of Saudi agents in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.
This past week, Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and Middle East adviser, met for the first time since the killing with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the kingdom. American intelligence agencies have concluded that the crown prince ordered Mr. Khashoggi's killing.
Mr. Kushner met with Prince Mohammed to promote a potential resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in which the prince and his country may play a big role.
The Trump administration, meanwhile, has defied a congressional deadline to report about who was responsible for the killing. Instead, President Trump has equivocated about whether Prince Mohammed might have authorized it, even as he has extolled the value of Saudi Arabian oil sales and defense contracts.
American friends of Dr. Fitaihi are stepping up a campaign to press Washington to take up his case. They say the Trump administration's public silence about his incarceration is at odds with Mr. Trump's repeated boasts about his successful efforts to extricate American citizens held abroad.
Mr. Trump counted 20 this past week, including at least one dual national.
Aya Hijazi, a dual citizen of the United States and Egypt who was invited to the White House for a televised appearance with Mr. Trump after her release from jail in Cairo, invoked the president's "America First" slogan.
"Not making Walid Fitaihi a priority will send a message that America isn't really first," she said in text message to The New York Times. "Financial deals and petroleum are."
Howard M. Cooper, a lawyer for Dr. Fitaihi, said in a letter to the State Department in January that he had indicated to his wife and family that "he is in fear for his life, that he cannot take his situation any longer, and that he desires all possible help." A State Department representative declined to comment on the case, citing privacy considerations.
Saudi officials have denied any mistreatment of detainees. A spokesman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington said the kingdom has signed the convention against torture and prohibits its use.
"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia takes any and all allegations of ill treatment of defendants awaiting trial or prisoners serving their sentences very seriously," the spokesman said.
Dr. Fitaihi got his American citizenship while studying and practicing medicine in the United States, where one of his sons lives. After returning to Saudi Arabia, he founded a private hospital in Jeddah and became well known as a motivational speaker.
The reason for his detention is unclear. But the friend who relayed Dr. Fitaihi's account of his treatment said that he was questioned primarily about a relative by marriage who had also been detained, Adel Fakeih, a former top aide to the crown prince. Dr. Fitaihi believed his interrogators were seeking evidence against Mr. Fakeih, the friend said.
Announcing the end of its corruption purge at the end of January, Saudi Arabia said that 64 people were still being held for prosecution on new or pre-existing criminal charges. His friends say they believe Dr. Fitaihi is among them.

Texto completo: Tribune News Service
WASHINGTON - Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, sent a letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone on Friday accusing the White House of purposefully delaying the committee's investigation into executive security clearances.
"The White House has stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the committee," the letter reads.
The message sent to Cipollone on
Friday was prompted by a Thursday
New York Times report alleging that President Donald Trump lied to the paper in a January interview about his involvement in granting a security clearance to son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner.
"President Trump ordered his chief of staff to grant his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, a top-secret security clearance last year, overruling concerns flagged by intelligence officials and the White House's top lawyer," The Times report reads.
The Times report also explains both former White House chief of staff John Kelly and former White House counsel Donald McGahn II wrote internal
Memos bringing attention to Kushner receiving a security clearance.
The Oversight Committee is seeking answers on why Trump overruled his advisers and allowed Kushner to get his security clearance. It is also concerned about what information officials obtained regarding Kushner that led to denying him access to sensitive information.
The committee is also looking into why Kelly and McGahn felt compelled to release memos, and why the counsel's office is continuing to withhold documents and witness accounts from the committee.

Texto completo: White House Roundup
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump early last year directed his then-chief of staff, John Kelly, to give presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance - a move that made Kelly so uncomfortable that he documented the request in writing, according to current and former administration officials.
After Kushner, a senior White House adviser, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, pressured the president to grant Kushner the long-delayed clearance, Trump instructed Kelly to fix the problem, according to a person familiar with Kelly's account, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.
Kelly told colleagues that the decision to give Kushner top-secret clearance was not supported by career intelligence officials, and he memorialized Trump's request in an internal memo, according to two people familiar with the memo and the then-chief of staff's concerns.
By May, Kushner had been granted a permanent security clearance to view top-secret material - a move that followed months of concern inside the White House about his inability to secure such access.
Kushner's lawyer publicly described the process as one that had gone through normal channels, a description that Kelly did not view as accurate, according to a person familiar with his reaction.
The former chief of staff, who left the administration at the beginning of this year, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump's push to get Kushner clearance - and the chief of staff's concerns about it - was first reported by the New York Times, which also reported that then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn had concerns about Kushner's clearance.Congressional Democrats said Thursday they plan to aggressively scrutinize the role Trump played in securing Kushner's clearance.
Kushner did not receive a clearance to see the most highly classified intelligence the government produces, known as sensitive and compartmented information, or SCI, The Washington Post reported last July.
Kushner's foreign entanglements caused anxiety among U.S. intelligence officials who are ultimately responsible for deciding whether he should have SCI clearances, that step above top secret, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of internal deliberations.
Conservatives fan fears of socialism
WASHINGTON - As the White House gears up for the 2020 campaign, it's pressing the case that Democrats are rallying behind what it's calling the policies of "socialism."
Trying to portray Democrats as out of step with ordinary Americans, Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference that the choice in the next election is "between freedom and socialism, between personal responsibility and government dependence."
It was the latest step in a coordinated effort by President Donald Trump and his allies to drive up enthusiasm among the GOP base by sowing fears about the policies pushed by Democrats.

Texto completo: As a French Jew, I am often asked about anti-Semitism in France. Without fail, the last question at any appearance I make is the same: Should French Jews leave and move to Israel or America? I always insist that Jews have played an instrumental role in founding modern-day France, and if anyone is going to leave, it should be the anti-Semites.
But implied in the question is the belief that America, like Israel, is a safe haven for Jews. And I am not sure this is still the case. It's the opposite, in fact; in recent years, I have witnessed the oldest hatred in the world brewing in the United States.
I wish to warn my Jewish American brothers and sisters of the danger I perceive from the vantage point of a French Jew all too familiar with anti-Semitism. I wish to warn them that they are under siege.
Anti-Semitism in the United States is proliferating in a number of ways. The tradition of Holocaust denial is alive and well. The boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign is gaining traction on campuses across the country. The left has embraced a form of identity politics that excludes Jews.
Then there's the president himself.
I do not believe, as many Americans do, that the president was responsible for the massacre of 11 Jews at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue. But from the moment he began rallying hordes of far-right extremists, I have found myself with a singular thought: Jews, be wary of Trump.
Since his arrival on the scene, Trump has championed the legacy of Charles Lindbergh, the first architect of "America First" and a known anti-Semite.
But this was only the first of what has become a long list of signs signifying how bad the president of the United States is for the Jews. Think of the tweets and retweets during the presidential campaign, where every strain of lunacy seemed woven together to form a single story of hate and criminality. Think of the bile brewing on social media as so many souls called for the reopening of gas chambers and "ovens" for the Jews of New York and Los Angeles.
Or think of the president's consistent refusal to call out anti-Semitism. Think of the strange set of circumstances that resulted in the president's remarks on Holocaust Remembrance Day, when he omitted the 6 million Jews exterminated by the Nazis. Think of his refusal to condemn the marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, who chanted, "Jews will not replace us"; instead, President Trump called them "fine people."
Then there was the time he told the Republican Jewish Coalition: "I know why you're not going to support me! It's because I don't want your money!"
We are often told of Trump's love of Israel. But Israel should tread carefully with this president.
How reckless and hazardous to the Jewish state was Trump's recent move announcing the withdrawal of troops from Syria? The brewing destabilization of the region aside, from an Israeli prism the betrayal of the Kurds is disastrous. Iraqi Kurdistan is one of the very rare areas of the Middle East where Jews and Judaism are viewed positively. I don't know another Muslim country where the memory and birthplace of a future Israeli defense minister are held in such high regard and with pride, nor where Yom HaShoah is celebrated with devotion and respect each year.
And following the 2017 referendum and the Battle of Kirkuk, Trump served Kurdistan to Iran on a silver platter, with no regard for Israel or its security.
As for the much-hailed historic move of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, this decision was a campaign promise made to Sheldon Adelson, as The New York Times reported, in exchange for $25 million. No doubt, the president was also thinking of the Christian right and their neo-evangelical, anti-European form of Zionism that sees in Jews bit players in a spectacle of the End of Times. In this religious fantasy, the Jewish people's wholesale return to the Holy Land is considered a prelude to their conversion. (In this context, it's not surprising in the least that the two pastors invited to bless the new embassy were two declared anti-Semites: John Hagee and Robert Jeffress.)
It's hard to believe that the move of the embassy came from a love of the Jewish people, especially in light of Trump's limited responses to the unprecedented spike in anti-Semitic attacks.
It's not just that his responses to anti-Semitism are pathetic and limp. The president of the United States cannot play with fire and be so irresponsible with his words. He must not, as he did in Charlottesville, say that there are fine people in the ranks of neo-Nazis. The president of the United States cannot - he must not - flirt with David Duke.
The president of the United States cannot pretend not to know that words have memory; they are like reactors that emit radiation. And the radiation given off by the words "America First" are on the Nazi spectrum.
It's simply too dangerous, and can result only in a lightning storm of hate.
That tornado came last October on a Sabbath morning in the form of the hundreds of bullets that pierced the bodies of 11 holy Jews who had gathered to pray.
America, as a shelter for the Jews, was suddenly swept to the dust. For the dissolution of this long-standing bond, Trump bears a portion of responsibility.
Bernard-Henri Lévy is a philosopher, activist and filmmaker and is the author of more than 30 books, including the forthcoming "The Empire and the Five Kings," and "The Genius of Judaism."

Texto completo: Surprise, there is a Frank Gehry in New Haven.
Starchitect Frank Gehry had his 90th birthday this week. It may be one of his most notable plaudits that very few of us in New Haven know that the Pritzker Prize winner designed a building here. He did in 1989. For Yale (who else?). Who knew?
New Haven boasts the work of architects Louis Kahn, Eero Saarinen, Paul Rudolph, Philip Johnson — and so many more. There are scores of “significant” Modern Masterpieces in a city of 120,000. You could argue that these great builders of the Modern Era have left New Haven with more “statement” buildings per capita than any other place in the world. But Frank Gehry, equally famed in our culture, has one too.

The Yale Psychiatric Institute built a residence and treatment center for 66 adolescents and young adults in 1989. The building had a paltry $13 million cost and had a goal that was starkly distinct from virtually all the other palaces of fame Gehry has made all over the world.
Why don’t we know about it? Think about the privacy of who this complex was built for. The Yale Psychiatric Institute is closed to the public. The buildings fill a small block at the intersection of Cedar Street and Congress Avenue at the edge of the campus of the Yale Medical School. Frank Goldberger in his New York Times review says that ‘there are occasional moments when the building positively bursts into glory.” but these parts are fully obscured from view by any but those who use the building. Goldberger judges that the building “suffers from its intentional anonymity.”
Created with local architect Allan Dehar, the irony of the architectural superstar Gehry being dissed as being too modest is simply hilarious. Compare this building’s visible anonymity, using blank brick boxes facing the street, hiding an expressive gym and courtyard behind them, with Gentry’s 2003 effervescing Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles where the outside explodes into its context. Architects can walk and chew gum at the same time. Making a designer fit a box, a one trick pony, is a shallow as the verdicts we all inveigh on first impression.
(According to an item the New Haven Register published in 1989: The three new buildings, consisting of 76,000 square feet, were designed as a village community complex. The new YPI facilities comprise a cluster of geometric shapes, creating an upbeat avant-garde effect, using an unusual collection of materials, including lead-coated copper, chain-link fabric and dryvit, a stucco material. "Light and Hope for Many," the theme of the YPI opening celebration, is exemplified in the high ceilings, window walls, centrally located glass enclosed nursing stations, more spacious patient and community rooms and other unique window designs bring an abundance of natural light into the buildings. The architects hope that this design, while minimizing the sense of institutionalization and claustrophobia, will foster in patients a sense of both protection and connection to the world beyond. The general contractor was E&F Construction Co. of Bridgeport.)
Compare the Yale Psychiatric Institute’s intentional stealth, following its essential mission, to welcome and protect its tender users, to the The Yale Health Center, designed by Mack Scogin Merrill Elam Architects, a black sculpture expressing itself next to the sculpted whiteness of the Yale Whale and the large Xeroxing of Gothic Revival/neo-traditionalist architect from the first half of the 20th century, James Gamble Rogers by Robert A.M. Stern at the Franklin and Murray Colleges. Whether channeling an ocean mammal, Darth Vader or Hogwarts, those buildings, designed by Saarinen, Scogin/Elam and Stern are all about projecting themselves, for good or ill.
Maybe Gehry’s psychiatric institute shows non-architects like Goldberger that designing buildings is not just breast-beating genius, it is also about who is using the building you design, and where that use is. Here, Gehry (and Dehar) protect those who need protection. If buildings were birthday presents, we could simply rip off the Yale Psychiatric Institute’s brick wrapping paper to reveal the complex’s sculptured interior. But successful buildings are not birthday gifts, buildings are not just about their designers. Successful buildings fuse where they are, who uses then, and who designed them.
Even though you may miss it, unlike the Yale Whale, or the Yale Art Gallery or the nearby Knights of Columbus Tower, we have a Gehry Building right here in New Haven, for everyone to simply ignore — a gift every day of the year.

Texto completo: In the latest bombshell to ricochet around the Beltway press, the New York Times discovered that against the guidance of President Trump's top intelligence officials and legal counsel, he unilaterally granted his son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance.

The president has that power. This wouldn't even be a story if his camp hadn't spent months lying about it.

The president and Ivanka Trump both publicly maintained that the former had no interference in the matter. They didn't perjure themselves, but they lied to the press and the public about it.

Naturally, the Left is outraged about the matter. While the rest of the country likely won't even hear about the story, they have a right to be outraged.

Trump manufactured this controversy. He has the full legal authority to grant security clearances against the discretion of his counsel. If he wanted to flex a muscle and gift his son-in-law a top-secret clearance, so be it. But he didn't have to lie about it and shouldn't have lied about it.

Another day, another dumb reminder that amid one of the greatest job markets in modern history, relative foreign policy successes, successful prison and tax reform legislation, and judicial appointees being confirmed at breakneck speed, Trump can't stop creating his own turmoil.

Texto completo: Times on Kushner’s clearance: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump last year ordered officials to grant top-secret security clearance to his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, according to a report published Thursday by The New York Times. Kushner was granted the high-level clearance in May after a lengthy background check. The Times, citing anonymous sources, said Trump demanded Kushner’s clearance despite the concerns of intelligence officials, then-chief of staff John Kelly and then-White House counsel Don McGahn. The newspaper said Kelly wrote in an internal memo that he had been "ordered" to give top-secret clearance to Kushner. McGahn wrote a memo in which he advised against such clearance. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders declined to comment on the story.
Israeli Gaza actions condemned: GENEVA — Israeli soldiers intentionally fired on civilians and could have committed crimes against humanity during a string of crackdowns against Palestinian demonstrators last year in Gaza that left 189 people dead, including some who did not pose a threat, U.N.-backed investigators said Thursday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted the council for "setting new records for hypocrisy and mendacity, out of an obsessive hatred of Israel."
Background check bill passes: WASHINGTON — The House on Thursday passed legislation that would extend the window for completing a background check for gun purchases and transfers to at least 10 business days. The Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 passed on a vote of 228-198. Three Republicans crossed party lines to back the legislation, while seven Democrats voted against it. The bill follows Wednesday’s vote on a separate measure expanding federal background checks for gun purchases and transfers. Neither measure is likely to pass the Senate, and the president has said he’d veto both.
TPS status to be extended: WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that it will comply with a federal court order by automatically extending to January 2020 the temporary protected status of more than 250,000 immigrants the Trump administration left facing possible deportation. The renewals will cover beneficiaries whose provision residency status was sept to lapse after the Trump administration determined they no longer merited the protections. Court injunctions provided relief for people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan and Honduras. DHS had not indicated how it would comply with the order.
GuaidÃ³ says he’ll return: BRASILIA, Brazil — Speaking to reporters in Brazil’s capital, Juan GuaidÃ³, who is recognized by many countries as Venezuela’s president, said Thursday he would return to Caracas this weekend despite "threats." GuaidÃ³ did not detail what threats he faces, but one possibility is that Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro could order his arrest.
Pedestrian deaths higher: DETROIT — The Governors Highway Safety Association blamed increased driver and walker distraction, driver impairment, and more SUVs on the road for the highest number of pedestrian deaths in 28 years. The safety group’s new report says 6,227 pedestrians were killed last year, up 4 percent from 2017 and 35 percent from 2008.

Is casino revenue really helping schools?

Texto completo: Every time he speaks to Rotary, Kiwanis or other groups, Larry Gregory says people ask if casino tax revenue isn't supposed to be pumping millions of dollars into schools across Mississippi.
Every time he tells the audience it's a misconception, said Gregory, executive director of the Mississippi Gaming and Hospitality Association and former executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Association. If there had been talk about education becoming a major beneficiary when voters approved casinos back in the early 1990s, he said it didn't make it into any of the regulations.
It's not in the Mississippi Gaming Control Act or other legal document that casino tax revenue specifically would benefit education throughout the state, he said.
A 1990 report in the the New York Times said new jobs, large payrolls, revenue for cities and counties and more business for local suppliers were what residents and officials hoped the casinos would bring. It didn't mention schools being the priority.
State regulations do say schools get a percentage of the tax at the local level.
Casino revenue a windfall for some school districts, not others In Biloxi, in Tunica and other cities and counties where casinos flourished, schools have shared in the prosperity.
"They've got a windfall given to them that the other school districts don't," Gregory said.
On the 25th anniversary of casinos in Mississippi in 2017, Mississippi Gaming and Hospitality Association reported that Mississippi casinos had paid $6.5 billion in state taxes and $638 million in taxes for local education over the first 25 years.
In the first five years of the casino industry in south Mississippi, $26 million in tax revenue was funneled to local schools, according to a 1997 article in the Sun Herald. Gulfport schools collected $3.9 million of that total, the report said, and used the money for more teachers, better libraries, newer computers and indoor physical education rooms in every grade school.
"Gaming dollars are doing so much right now that has been neglected for 37 years," said Larry Drawdy, superintendent at the Biloxi School District at that time. "We were at a point where we would have had to raise local property taxes or do without and have less than a quality standard of education."
There were drawbacks. Schools that didn't get tax money from the casinos struggled to offer competitive salaries while teachers in gambling towns got raises, the article said.
Before casinos, Tunica County schools spent less per student and had the lowest test scores in the state, according to a 1999 case study. By 1997, more than $3 million a year was going to the local schools, according to "The Effects of Casino Gaming on Tunica County." But the report says the school system was still under control of the state. Instead of going to college, the report said bright high school graduates were going to work at the casinos.
Casinos and schools: How the local distribution works Mississippi casinos pay 12 percent tax on gross gaming revenue. While most businesses pay taxes on profits, casinos pay this 12 percent tax on winnings before deducting the cost of wages, insurance and other expenses of doing business.
The breakdown from there is:
8 percent goes to the state general fund, which is used in part for education. $3 million goes to the bond sinking fund to pay for improvements to state roads and bridges.
Up to 4 percent — of the 12 percent — is split between local governments and schools. In Biloxi, for instance, 40 percent goes into the city general fund, 20 percent to city public safety, 20 percent to Biloxi School District, 10 percent is distributed to public schools in Harrison County and 10 percent to Harrison County.
Of the 151 school districts in Mississippi, only the districts in the seven counties where casinos operate benefit from the local distribution.
Biloxi School District receives about $6 million a year from the tax on gross casino revenue, which Shane Switzer, director of business, says is about 10 percent of the school's overall budget. The addition of sports betting has boosted the city's share by more than $200,000 since the state fiscal year began in July.
"In addition to the gaming revenue tax, we also receive ad valorem taxes from both land assessments and personal property assessments," he said. Casinos pay a local fee on each slot machine, along with other use and wage taxes. Mississippi's casinos had nearly 20,000 employees and a monthly payroll of $51 million in December 2018.
Casino taxes go into general fund that provides money for education Under Florida law, all tax revenue from slot machines goes to Florida's Educational Enhancement Trust Fund to be distributed to school districts and public colleges, along with providing financial aid to Florida students. Missouri is another state that directs a large portion of casino taxes to education, according to the American Gaming Association.
Although Mississippi doesn't have these provisions, casinos' taxes do benefit all school districts throughout the state, said Kathy Waterbury with the Department of Revenue.
Nearly all of the tax on gross gaming revenue the state collects this year will go into the general fund that provides money for education.
A portion of the sales tax collected at casinos and other businesses across Mississippi is dedicated to education, Waterbury said.
"In fiscal year 2018, DOR transferred more than $2 billion in sales tax revenue to the state's general fund," she said. These transfers are made after all other diversions are paid to cities and for hotel and other special taxes.
She said 2.266 percent of the total sales tax revenue is deposited in the School Ad Valorem Fund up to a total of $42 million annually. Anything over $42 million is transferred to the Education Enhancement Fund, which also receives 9 percent of the state tax revenue. That amounted to $299 million last year, she said.
More for education? That's up to the state lawmakers. In 2015 House Bill 1630 changed the way casino revenue was split and directed revenue that previously was earmarked for bridges and highways near casinos to instead be used throughout the state.
The changes didn't provide additional money for education.
Waterbury said the Legislature allocated a portion of the $3 million-a-month bond sinking fund and in 2016 provided $500,000 each month to the Gulfport Aquarium Construction Fund, $41,663 for Catfish Row Museum Construction Fund and $83,334 to Bass Cultural Arts Center Fund. In 2017, another $500,000 a month from the bond sinking fund was earmarked for construction of the Gulfport aquarium. Beginning in 2018, all $3 million a month is again directed to the bond sinking fund.
The state Legislature had another opportunity to direct gambling money to education in 2018, when after years of debate, a lottery bill finally passed in Mississippi.
Unlike Louisiana, where 35 percent of lottery winnings help fund education across the state, Mississippi legislators chose to make the state's crumbling roads and bridges the priority.
Education will get a share of the lottery proceeds in Mississippi if there is any remaining revenue after $80 million a year is spent on roads and bridges.

Supreme Court Tosses Civil Case Against Cosby

Texto completo: The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined review of a case brought by Bill Cosby accuser Kathrine McKee (McKee v. Cosby), who alleged being defamed when Cosby's attorney characterized her story of being raped four decades ago as a fabricated lie.
In writing the concurring opinion for the court, Justice Clarence Thomas states, "We did not beginmeddling in this area until 1964, nearly 175 years after the First Amendment was ratified. The States are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm.We should reconsider our jurisprudence in this area."
The denial comes five months after the comedian was sentenced to three-to-10 years in prison for aggravated indecent assault.
Before finally weighing in on McKee's case, the justices deferred consideration nearly a dozen times over the course of several months, a move the Hollywood Reporter speculated could have been the result of sensitivity surrounding the Capitol Hill confirmation fight over Brett Kavanaugh, who himself was accused of sexual misconduct.
McKee is a former L.A. morning talk show host, who alleges Cosby raped her in 1974 in a Detroit hotel room while she was on tour with Sammy Davis Jr., her boyfriend at the time.
Cosby has consistently denied all the allegations against him.
The question presented in McKee's petition was "whether a victim of sexual misconduct who merely publicly states that she was victimized (i.e., #metoo) has thrust herself to the forefront of a public debate in an attempt to influence the outcome, thereby becoming a limited-purpose public figure who loses her right to recover for defamation absent a showing of actual malice by clear and convincing evidence."
Cosby's attorneys presented the question a little differently: "Whether an actress who uses her celebrity status to gain access to national media outlets in order to publicly accuse an international entertainer - already in the midst of a public controversy concerning allegations against him - of additional misconduct is a limited-purpose public figure for purposes of defamation analysis."
In defamation law, plaintiffs must demonstrate actual malice on the part of public figure defendants in order to prevail in a defamation claim. The precedent was established under the 1964 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan decision and has been extended via several similar cases brought before the court during the intervening 55 years. Per Justice Thomas, "Like many plaintiffs subject to this 'almost impossible' standard, McKee was unable to make that showing."
Applied here, that would mean the statement by Cosby's ex-attorney Marty Singer, in response to press reports of the alleged rape of McKee byCosby,was knowingly false or had recklessly disregarded the truth, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
"I agree with the Court's decision not to take up that factbound question. I write to explain why, in an appropriate case, we should reconsider the precedents that require courts to ask it in the first place,"writes Thomas. "New York Times and the Court's decisions extending it were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law. Instead of simply applying the FirstAmendment as it was understood by the people who ratified it, the Court fashioned its own 'federal rule[s]' by balancing the 'competing values at stake in defamation suits.'"
In 2017, the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that McKee was a public figure and that she couldn't demonstrate actual malice.
"I amgrateful to theUnited States Supreme Court and to the federal courts in Massachusetts for upholding the law in this case. I thank each of the Justices for their ruling, which gives me renewed hope that the fair and impartial courts in this country will go on to deliver justice," Cosby said in a statement released through his publicist on Tuesday.
"This is the very reason, why I, [Bill Cosby] have no remorse because I am innocent and will continue to channel the strength of the great political prisoners. Finally the truth is being allowed to be heard and read by the public," Cosby said.

Texto completo: After a behind-the-scenes shift, "Better Things" returns to FX. And a minimalist Swedish thriller is streaming on Hulu.
What's on TV
BETTER THINGS 10 p.m. on FX. Our critic called the second season of this comedy series a "tremendous leap forward" from the first. The third season, beginning on Thursday, promises to be a seismic shift: It's the show's first since one of its creators, Louis C.K., admitted to sexual misconduct and was removed from involvement with the series. Now, the show's other creator, Pamela Adlon, has taken full control. It's still the same series, still an absurdist, semi-autobiographical take on Adlon's life and family, with Adlon as a mother struggling with aging while raising three daughters: Max (Mikey Madison), Frankie (Hannah Alligood) and Duke (Olivia Edward). "So, where did I want to go with this season?" Adlon asked in a recent interview with The New York Times. "What I really wanted to do was say, 'Sam's a mess. Max is a mess. Phil's a mess. Frankie's a mess. Duke's a mess. Sunny's a mess.' I wanted to see these women kind of unraveling. I wanted [the theme of the season to be about] the changes of your life, and honoring that."
RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE 9 p.m. on VH1. After 10 seasons of ornate drag competitions, RuPaul Charles's pioneering reality competition series has become a household brand, having hatched multiple spinoff series and, over the years, probably used enough makeup to dress a small stadium. It has also challenged gender expectations and pushed boundaries, as its 11th season promises to continue to do.
What's Streaming
THE GUILTY (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. The action in this feature debut of the Swedish filmmaker Gustav Möller takes place almost entirely on the other end of a telephone line. The story centers on a police officer (Jakob Cedergren) who's been relegated to emergency-response phone duty. He's bored, until a woman calls saying she's been kidnapped. Rather than passing the case along, he tries to crack it from the confines of his desk. In her review for The Times, Jeannette Catsoulis called the screenplay "ingenious" and Cedergren's performance "astonishing." She wrote that the film "paints such vivid pictures with words that, afterward, we're not exactly sure what we saw and what was merely imagined."
BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN THE OPERA Stream on BroadwayHD. The Belgian director Ivo van Hove is both one of the most successful directors of his generation and, Ben Brantley wrote in The Times in 2015, "the contemporary theater's most celebrated exponent of maximal minimalism." That excessive nonexcess is in full action in this film of a production of "Brokeback Mountain" the opera, composed by Charles Wuorinen, presented by Teatro Real of Madrid and directed by van Hove. It takes the emotions of Annie Proulx's story of cowboy romance, also the source of the 2005 film, and elevates them to operatic levels.

Texto completo: President Trump and Kim Jong Un met Wednesday for the second time in eight months, kicking off a two-day summit that could determine whether North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear weapons despite its failure to move toward denuclearization since the last summit.
Even as the two leaders shared grilled sirloin and chocolate cake at a five-star hotel, the high-wattage summit stagecraft was upstaged by a dramatic congressional hearing in Washington, where Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen denounced the president as "a racist" and a "con man" and said he had skirted or violated banking, tax and campaign finance laws.
The explosive testimony clearly rattled the president in Hanoi. He lashed out at Cohen on Twitter, accusing him of doing "bad things unrelated to Trump" and "lying in order to reduce" a three-year prison sentence for crimes that included arranging payments during the 2016 election to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump.

Aides to the president, already nervous that Trump would offer concessions to Kim, acknowledged that Cohen's harsh testimony and Trump's reaction to it are additional wild cards in the high-stakes summitry.
Although Kim is the authoritarian ruler of one of the most repressive nations, Trump called him a "good friend" in a tweet and praised him when they met Wednesday.
Trump told reporters before the dinner that he was satisfied with the progress since their first summit in Singapore in June.
"I thought the first summit was a great success, and I think this will hopefully be equal or greater than the first," Trump said. "We made a lot of progress. And I think the biggest progress was our relationship. It's really a good one."
The two leaders issued a vague statement in Singapore calling for denuclearization. But they did not produce a timetable or require any specific actions, and working-level negotiations have largely stalled since then. U.S. intelligence officials say North Korea has continued to produce fissile fuel for nuclear weapons over the last eight months.
The second summit began shortly after 6 p.m. at the elegant Metropole hotel in central Hanoi. Trump and Kim, who have developed a personal chemistry, greeted each other warmly, shaking hands, smiling and posing for photos in front of a display of U.S. and North Korean flags.
In brief remarks, Kim praised Trump's "courageous decision" to begin a dialogue, and Trump promised to help develop North Korea's economy if he denuclearizes.
"Your country has tremendous economic potential, unbelievable, unlimited," Trump said. "I look forward to watching it happen and to helping it to happen, and we will help it to happen."
In response to a question, Trump signaled that he had not backed away from his demand for full and verifiable denuclearization. He also confirmed reports that a declaration to end the Korean War was under consideration.
When a reporter asked about Cohen's testimony, the president pursed his lips but did not answer.
Afterward, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders informed the small pool of reporters who had been allowed into the room that they would no longer be allowed access to the next event, a "social dinner," because their questions during the photo op had apparently upset the participants. Kim was not asked a question.
Two of the six reporters in the pool were eventually allowed into the dinner, but those who asked the questions were barred. In a statement, Sanders cited "the sensitive nature of the event," but media organizations cried foul.
"Previous administrations have often intervened to protect press access when foreign leaders have tried to limit coverage of presidential meetings abroad," said Norman Pearlstine, editor of the Los Angeles Times. "The fact that this White House has done the opposite and excluded members of the press provides another sad example of its failure to uphold the American public's right to see and be informed about President Trump's activities."
While Trump bristled over reporters' questions, he relished the attention of photographers snapping away before him. He singled out a New York Times photographer, asking him to send his photos to the White House so that he could share them with Kim.
The dictator, who does not allow a free press in his country, appeared to laugh.
It was the second time the White House limited access for reporters covering the nuclear summit.
A day earlier, the White House abruptly relocated a media workspace it had established in a hotel ballroom to accommodate hundreds of journalists, apparently after the North Korean delegation, which was staying at the hotel, raised objections.
Trump and Kim were joined at the dinner by Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo; Trump's acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney; Kim Yong Chol, a top aide to Kim; North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho; and their interpreters.
Their meetings were due to continue Thursday morning in Hanoi. The White House said that Trump would hold a news conference after his meetings with Kim and that he would then leave for Washington.
It's still unclear whether the two leaders will produce a more substantive agreement than the brief statement they issued in Singapore.
U.S. negotiators want detailed commitments from Pyongyang to dismantle at least part of its nuclear weapons facilities, while Kim wants relief from punishing economic sanctions and a declaration to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Trump is likely to determine what, if any, moves to make after meeting with Kim on Thursday.
"It's all up to him," the official said, acknowledging that national security advisor John Bolton, a longtime skeptic on North Korea, has in effect been sidelined.
One possible action: The two leaders could announce an agreement to open liaison offices in each other's capitals, a step aimed at normalizing relations and providing a more traditional platform for the nuclear negotiations.
Earlier Wednesday, Trump held multiple meetings with Vietnamese government officials, enjoying a red-carpet welcome at Hanoi's historic presidential palace and office of government.
He also announced Vietnamese investment in U.S. aerospace, pointing to the host country's "thriving" economy as an example of the growth possible for North Korea should it take steps to denuclearize.
In addition to tweeting about Cohen, Trump took a shot at Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who has acknowledged misrepresenting his military service during the Vietnam War. Blumenthal had claimed he fought in Vietnam, when he actually served in the Marine Corps reserves and was not deployed overseas.
Trump resurfaced a favorite nickname, tweeting that he had "now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal," adding, "His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud -- he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!"
A White House readout of Trump's meetings with the Vietnamese did not mention them discussing Blumenthal.
Trump never served in uniform and avoided Vietnam by receiving five draft deferments, including one for bone spurs in his heels.
Cohen told the House Oversight Committee that Trump once acknowledged to him that the bone spurs were just an excuse, telling him he avoided Vietnam because he wasn't "stupid."
When the U.S. hearings began, administration officials were ending the long day in Hanoi in the hotel bar. Cohen's testimony played silently on a big screen just feet from their table.

13-year-old girl breaks barriers by turning pro

Texto completo: Viewers who paid close attention to Nike's all-women "Dream Crazier" ad, which debuted during Sunday's Academy Awards and features Serena Williams, might have noticed a young-looking soccer player toward the end, gazing calmly and confidently at the camera. As it turns out, that player is indeed young, but at age 13 she already has turned professional.
Oh, and Olivia Moultrie is now officially on the Nike roster, but she won't be wearing the swoosh while playing for the University of North Carolina. In turning pro, she is giving up the scholarship from the Tar Heels she accepted at the tender age of 11, but her father is confident that it's the right call.
"For literally almost every kid in girls' soccer, you should go to college; there's not a million dollars at the end of the rainbow," K.C. Moultrie told the New York Times in a story published Monday. "I think if you're truly, truly elite, if your goal is to be a world-class player and a pro and, in Olivia's case, to be the best player in the world, there's no way it's better to play college than it is to play full time."
Moultrie's agent, Spencer Wadsworth, told the Times that her Nike deal was worth more than the value of a four-year scholarship to a school such as UNC. Having been the youngest girls' soccer player to publicly accept a college scholarship, she is now the youngest to pass it up in favor of the pro ranks. "You see it more and more now where women's soccer is catching up to the men's side," Wadsworth said, "and there's more opportunities for them."
It's not clear what kind of organized soccer Moultrie, who has also given up high school and youth club eligibility, will be playing for the next few years, apart from participation on a rung of the U.S. national program. Both the National Women's Soccer League and FIFA have age-limit rules that indicate she can't compete until she is 18.
Turning pro at a young age isn't that unusual for top talents among boys; 15-year-old Leo Torres, for instance, signed this month with the USL's San Antonio FC. The U.S. national team's Christian Pulisic signed with Germany's Borussia Dortmund in 2015 at age 16, and Freddy Adu was just 14 when D.C. United took him first overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. Adu's struggles are a cautionary tale.
"I tell her all the time, 'Nobody cares that you're the best at 12,' " K.C. Moultrie said to the Times last year. "If you're not the best at 17 or 18, nobody's going to care. You're going to be one of those child actors that nobody cares about. You're going to be Macaulay Culkin."
With a push from Nike, it's safe to say that Moultrie has reached child-star status.

Resumen: In other words, you can't get away from these when you might fast-forward through a promotional spot during an ad break (and the snipes mean valuable ad time isn't wasted on promos during the breaks). The Times said snipes are also different from bugs, "those network logos that pop up in screen corners during shows," and are successors to the decades-old, nonstop information crawls on the bottom of the screen during sports and news programs. [...]as annoying as they are -- making your TV look more like a cluttered computer screen -- executives told the Times that "the trend toward busy screens is an attempt to cater to the tastes and habits of younger viewers, who reflexively toggle among screens, online and on cellphones." The result was what "The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows" called a youth-oriented action show "in the ‘Starsky & Hutch' mold."

A: What you encountered is called a snipe, an onscreen promotion for an upcoming show, and we're long past the point of complaining them away.

As the New York Times reported in 2007, they are a way "to cram promotions onto television screens in the age of channel surfing, ad skipping and screen-based multitasking." In other words, you can't get away from these when you might fast-forward through a promotional spot during an ad break (and the snipes mean valuable ad time isn't wasted on promos during the breaks).

Q: Back in the late '80s or early '90s, there was a cop show on TV for a short time. The premise was a Northern detective, possibly from Detroit or Chicago, who was disciplined for something and sent south, I believe to Texas, and partnered with a detective from the new city.

A: The series you remember was called "Houston Knights," which premiered on CBS in the spring of 1987. Michael ParÃ© played Joey La Fiamma, a Chicago officer transferred to Houston to evade mobsters trying to kill him. He also drove a Cobra (although at least one source says his was a replica). La Fiamma was teamed with the lower-key Levon Lundy, a local officer played by Michael Beck. The result was what "The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows" called a youth-oriented action show "in the ‘Starsky & Hutch' mold." It ended about 15 months after its debut. I do not know of an authorized DVD; there are some clips from the show on YouTube.

Texto completo: Cyber Command blocked entity's Internet access during 2018 midterms
The U.S. military blocked Internet access to an infamous Russian entity seeking to sow discord among Americans during the 2018 midterms, several U.S. officials said, a warning that the Kremlin's operations against the United States are not cost-free.
The strike on the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, a company underwritten by an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, was part of the first offensive cyber-campaign against Russia designed to thwart attempts to interfere with a U.S. election, the officials said.
"They basically took the IRA offline," according to one individual familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. "They shut them down."
The operation marked the first muscle-flexing by U.S. Cyber Command, with intelligence from the National Security Agency, under new authorities it was granted by President Trump and Congress last year to bolster offensive capabilities. The president approved of the general operation to prevent Russian interference in the midterms, officials said.
Whether the impact of the St. Petersburg action will be long-lasting remains to be seen. Russia's tactics are evolving, and some analysts were skeptical that the strike would deter the Russian troll factory or Putin, who, according to U.S. intelligence officials, ordered an "influence" campaign in 2016 to undermine faith in U.S. democracy. U.S. officials have also assessed that the Internet Research Agency works on behalf of the Kremlin.
"Such an operation would be more of a pinprick that is more annoying than deterring in the long run," said Thomas Rid, a strategic-studies professor at Johns Hopkins University who was not briefed on the details.
Some U.S. officials argued that "grand strategic deterrence" is not always the goal. "Part of our objective is to throw a little curveball, inject a little friction, sow confusion," said one defense official. "There's value in that. We showed what's in the realm of the possible. It's not the old way of doing business anymore."
The action has been hailed as a success by Pentagon officials, and some senators credited Cyber Command with averting Russian interference in the midterms.
"The fact that the 2018 election process moved forward without successful Russian intervention was not a coincidence," said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who did not discuss the specific details of the operation targeting the St. Petersburg group. Without Cybercom's efforts, he said, there "would have been some very serious cyber-incursions."
Cybercom and the NSA declined to comment.
The disruption to the Internet Research Agency's networks took place as Americans went to the polls and a day or so afterward as the votes were tallied, to prevent the Russians from mounting a disinformation campaign that cast doubt on the results, according to officials.
The blockage was so frustrating to the trolls that they complained to their system administrators about the disruption, the officials said.
The Internet Research Agency as early as 2014 and continuing through the 2016 presidential election sought to undermine the U.S. political system, according to the Justice Department. Posing as Americans and operating social media pages and groups, Russian trolls sought to exacerbate tensions over issues such as race, sexual identity and guns.
The agency, according to federal prosecutors, is financed by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a tycoon from St. Petersburg and an ally of Putin. Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency and a company Prigozhin runs called Concord Management and Consulting were among 16 Russian individuals and companies a grand jury indicted a year ago as part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
In response to questions from The Washington Post, Prigozhin said in a statement on the Russian version of Facebook, "I cannot comment on the work of the Internet Research Agency in any way because I have no relation to it." Concord Management declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation in the United States.
Another element of the Cyber Command campaign, first reported by the New York Times, involved "direct messaging" that targeted the trolls as well as hackers who work for the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. Using emails, pop-ups, texts or direct messages, U.S. operatives beginning in October let the Russians know that their real names and online handles were known and that they should not interfere in other nations' affairs, defense officials said.
Some Internet Research Agency officials were so perturbed by the messaging that they launched an internal investigation to root out what they thought were insiders leaking personnel information, according to two individuals.
The operation was part of a broader government effort to safeguard the 2018 elections, involving the Homeland Security, State and Justice departments, as well as the FBI. It was led by Gen. Paul Nakasone, who in July formed the Russia Small Group, made up of 75 to 80 people from Cybercom and the NSA, which are part of the Defense Department.
When Nakasone took the helm at the NSA and Cybercom in May, the White House and then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told him his priority needed to be the defense of the midterm elections, officials said. No one wanted a repeat of the 2016 campaign, when the GRU hacked Democratic Party computers and released troves of emails, and when the Internet Research Agency mounted its social media campaign to exploit social divisions.
In August, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats said Russia was continuing "a pervasive messaging campaign" to try to weaken and divide the United States, though officials concluded it was not as aggressive as the 2016 operation by Russia.
Two new U.S. authorities facilitated the move against the Internet Research Agency. A presidential order in August gave Cybercom greater latitude to undertake offensive operations below the level of armed conflict - actions that would not result in death, significant damage or destruction. And a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act passed last year also cleared the way for clandestine cyber-operations that fall below that same threshold, categorizing them as "traditional military activity."
"The calculus for us here was that you're just pushing back in the same way that the adversary has for years," a second defense official said. "It's not escalatory. In fact, we're finally in the game."
Other officials were more circumspect.
"Causing consternation or throwing sand in the gears may raise the cost of engaging in nefarious activities, but it is not going to cause a nation state to just drop their election interference or their malign influence in general," a third official said. "It's not going to convince the decision-maker at the top."
The operation also was the first real test of Cybercom's new strategy of "persistent engagement," issued in April, involving continually confronting the adversary and sharing information with partners. Cybercom in fall 2018 sent troops to Montenegro, Macedonia and Ukraine to help shore up their network defenses, and the Americans were able to obtain unfamiliar malware samples that private security researchers traced to the GRU, according to officials.
The Cybercom campaign also was part of what Nakasone described in an interview with Joint Force Quarterly as "acting outside our borders, being outside our networks, to ensure that we understand what our adversaries are doing."

Texto completo: HANOI – President Donald Trump opened an historic second summit with Kim Jong Un here Wednesday by pledging to push for North Korean denuclearization, even as he faced a political firestorm at home that threatens to eclipse any progress.
"I think it'll be very successful," Trump said as he and Kim posed for the cameras, proclaiming that he and his North Korean counterpart have a "great relationship. " At another photo opportunity, Kim said he is certain of an outcome "that will be welcomed by all people," and "I will do my best to make that happen. "
But Trump's diplomatic efforts come as his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, is expected to allege "criminal conduct" by the president in his first public testimony later Wednesday before Congress.
Trump met with Kim for a brief private conversation, followed by a "social dinner," all marking their first face-to-face encounter since the two met in Singapore last summer.
The ceremonial events, splashed across U. S. television screens early Wednesday morning, are expected give way to more substantive talks on the second and final day of the summit Thursday.
Simply put, Trump is trying to get Kim to commit to specific steps to eliminate nuclear weapons programs, while Kim wants Trump to lift economic sanctions that are crippling his impoverished nation.
In urging denuclearization, Trump told Kim that "some people would like to see it go quicker, but you're satisfied, I'm satisfied. " He also suggested giving up nuclear weapons would draw economic assistance, telling Kim that North Korea has "unbelievable, unlimited potential," and "I look forward to watching it happen and to helping it to happen. "
Asked about another goal – formally ending the Korean War – Trump told reporters, "we'll see. "
Meanwhile, Trump and other White House officials, mindful that the visit to Vietnam is competing for public attention among millions of Americans, attacked Cohen in the hours before the Kim meeting.
Trump tweeted that Cohen "did bad things unrelated to Trump," and "is lying in order to reduce his prison time. "
Some foreign policy analysts said they worry that Trump will be too willing to strike a bad deal with Kim in order to draw attention from his domestic problems, including Cohen's testimony.
"Congress should have postponed Cohen testimony, and Potus should not be tweeting about Cohen from Hanoi," tweeted Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Trump appeared annoyed when reporters asked him about Cohen at one of the summit photo opps. The White House later restricted reporter access to the dinner with Trump, Kim, and their aides.
The president did say he plans to hold a news conference after Thursday's meetings with the North Korean leader.
Trump also spent some pre-meeting time launching a Twitter attack on one of his congressional critics, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. , and claiming he discussed the senator's exaggerations about his war record in a meeting with Vietnam officials.
Tweeting that "I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal," Trump added that "his war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!"
Trump did not serve in the military during the Vietnam years, claiming college and medical deferments that included bone spurs in his foot.
The tumult back in Washington – lawmakers are also busy with a measure, approved by the Democratic-controlled House, to repeal Trump's border wall emergency – threaten to overshadow the work in Hanoi.
The president's troubles only add to the pressure to deliver results with Kim, who has signaled an interest in stronger relations with the United States but declined to dismantle his nuclear program.
In the days leading up to the summit, Trump appeared to lower expectations, claiming he is "in no rush" for denuclearization as long as Pyongyang continues to suspend missile tests.
Hours before the sit-down with the North Korean leader, Trump held largely ceremonial meetings with the leaders of Vietnam, and said their country can be a model for Kim, whom he described as "my friend. "
"Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize," Trump tweeted early in the day.
More than four decades after the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese view the summit as an opportunity to assert themselves on the world diplomatic stage. Heavily promoting the Trump-Kim summit, light poles in Hanoi are festooned with the flags of the U. S. , North Korea and Vietnam, mounted on a shield featuring an image of a handshake.
Large posters advertising the summit proclaim Hanoi as "The City For Peace. "
Raising the curtain: Trump-Kim summit: What happened at their first meeting – and what to expect at their next
The demands: Trump-Kim summit: North Korea must do something 'meaningful' to denuclearize before sanctions relief
Trump and Kim met at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hotel, an Art Nouveau masterpiece that harkens back to French colonial days in Hanoi. Past guests at the hotel have ranged from the comedian Charlie Chaplin to current Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A one-of-a-kind relationship: Trump-Kim summit: From fire and fury to love letters, not your traditional relationship
Among the issues on the Trump-Kim agenda:
What exactly is 'denuclearization'
Trump and aides have demanded that North Korea identify and destroy facilities used to make nuclear weapons. Kim, however, believes denuclearization should cover the entire region – including U. S. weapons systems designed to protect ally South Korea.
Economic sanctions standoff
Kim says he will not take major steps toward denuclearization until the United States and other countries lift at least some of the sanctions that have crippled North Korea's economy.
Trump has said sanctions will not be removed until Kim starts to denuclearize, though he has also held out the possibility of other economic assistance.
The economy is one of the reasons the U. S. agreed to meet in Vietnam. It hopes North Korea will follow the model of its communist ally, which developed a quasi-capitalist sector after economic reforms in the 1980s.

North Korea-U. S. relations
While neither leader is expected to open an embassy in the other's country, negotiators are discussing "liaison offices" that could be used to improve communications between the two governments.
A formal end to the Korean War
Trump has been open to a treaty to formally end the Korean War, which is technically ongoing even though hostilities were suspended with an armistice in 1953.
Negotiators are working on what aides called a "peace declaration," a non-binding political statement to affirm North and South Korea are no longer at war.
The history: How the North and South negotiated a truce in Korean War
Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korea expert with the Fletcher School at Tufts University, said Kim wants to do just enough to satisfy Trump – "like retiring an exhausted nuclear site he no longer needs" – while retaining a weapons program he depends on for survival.
"Two steps forward and one step back is still progress for North Korea," he said.
Olivia Enos, a policy analyst with the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, said she hopes Trump and his team tread cautiously. Give too much, she said, and the U. S. will lose its leverage and get little in return.
"The president's willingness to compromise threatens to undermine the administration's maximum pressure strategy that brought Kim Jong Un to the negotiating table in the first place," she said.
While analysts worried that Trump might give up too much to Kim, Cohen planned to mention the president's Vietnam trip in his testimony.
In a prepared statement first reported late Tuesday by Politico, Cohen cited the deferments Trump received during the Vietnam War.
"'You think I'm stupid, I wasn't going to Vietnam,'" Cohen quotes Trump as saying.
In his prepared testimony, Cohen adds: "I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now. "

The Media Will Re-Elect Trump; They would rather believe tall tales about Russia than hear what voters said in 2016.

Texto completo: Donald Trump's tenure has been a pleasant surprise compared to expectations, which isn't saying much. His administration has been as chaotic as predicted, driven by his habit of saying unscripted things. But it also has been productive of a few things: corporate tax reform, curbing regulation, injecting a semi-useful ferment into our foreign policy.
The remainder of his term was always likely to be dominated by the enormous baggage he brought with him—his business and personal history.
What was not foreseeable is the extent to which the FBI's meddling in the 2016 presidential race, using Russia's meddling as an excuse, would become a counter thread in the narrative of alleged Trump corruption.
There is a humongous irony here. Not expecting to win, Mr. Trump allowed his organization's desultory pursuit of a Trump tower in Moscow to continue during the 2016 campaign. Make no mistake, though a report that he instructed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about this matter has been debunked by none other than special counsel Robert Mueller, it remains true that Mr. Cohen lied to Congress. The lack of any other crime will not stop this episode from being central in a Democratic House impeachment hearing resting heavily on hints that there is something fishy about Mr. Trump's attitudes about Russia.
But what is true of Mr. Trump is also true of James Comey. He also expected Mr. Trump to lose. The FBI's own highly questionable actions during the campaign, which inadvertently helped elect Mr. Trump, he also expected to go unexamined.
Thus we find ourselves in a place where the Mueller report will settle nothing. It can't prove a negative, so the hunt by Democrats and the media for collusion will go on. Read any liberal pundit: Collusion now means if Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin both wanted Mr. Trump to be president, Mr. Trump is guilty. (Never mind that this stance essentially gives Mr. Putin's trolls and hackers a veto over who can be president.)
Under Democratic leadership, the House Intelligence Committee is well on its way to becoming a Warren Commission for an alternative universe in which JFK spent a nice day in Dallas. Rep. Adam Schiff has signaled that he intends to rake through Mr. Trump's business and bank records searching for the motive for collusion crimes that exist only in his imagination.
All this will be cheered on by backward-rationalizing pundits in the New York Times, justifying their own hysteria by portraying the routine, predictable and typically opportunistic partisan opposition faced by Mr. Trump as somehow exceptionally heroic.
A more honest rendition would notice that Mr. Trump—in many ways an accidental president—is also an unusually inexperienced and weak president, lacking even meaningful institutional roots in his own party.
Opinion Live Event
Join us on March 4 as WSJ Opinion's Paul Gigot leads a "State of TV News" panel discussion including Fox Business's Maria Bartiromo, CBS's Christy Tanner and "Network" actor Tony Goldwyn. Included in your admission to the event is a ticket to see "Network" on Broadway at a subsequent date.
It takes no heroism to oppose him. His statements are easily mocked for not conforming to the expected hypocrisies. He supplies his enemies more extracurricular targets than Bill Clinton did. He is universally reviled by elite institutions, including the media. Except for his knack for turning their hatred into lemonade, his only asset is his rapport with an unrich, unconnected voter segment that falls far short of a majority.
Indeed, it is hard to explain how Mr. Trump can simultaneously be such a menace and such a pushover that every Democratic officeholder in the country thinks, "If only I can stumble into the nomination, I'm sure to be the next president."
The answer, of course, is pundit vanity: Mr. Trump is a threat to democracy because writers opposing him then are very important people.
Our wonderful English language gives us a perfectly good word for major media interpretations of the Trump phenomenon. That word is fatuous. When historians weigh his well-advertised nature vs. the fantastic overreaction to his election, their first question will be: How did he become president? Voters must have had something in mind when they pulled the lever for somebody so seemingly unsuitable.
But even deeper into the night they will wonder: How did so rich and complex a society as ours survive a pundit class so devoid of judgment, so incapable even of identifying what was interesting about the times they live in?
So here we are. The media will eventually take notice of the strange acts of the U.S. intelligence community and their role in the 2016 election. Either that, or the story of the decade will continue to be told by alternative media outlets that, for all their faults, at least provide a venue for ignored realities to be taken account of.
In the meantime, imagine you're one of the millions who thinks four years of the Trump show is probably enough. You can only marvel at the obliviousness with which his enemies are working to assure (and even necessitate) his re-election.

Don Shirley's family appalled by 'Green Book'

Texto completo: It's hard to package history, race and truth in one cinematic box.
Hollywood claims to have done this with the "The Green Book," which won three Academy Awards Sunday night, including Best Picture.
The story was based on the friendship between Anthony "Lip" Vallenlonga, an Italian-American bouncer from the Bronx and renowned African-American musician Don Shirley, whom Vallenlonga in 1962 chauffeured through the Deep South.
As he accepted the best picture Oscar, "Green Book" director Peter Farrelly said the film that featured Mahershala Ali as Shirley and Viggo Mortensen as Vallenlonga was about "love" at a time when race, class and prejudice divided much of the country.
But there is no love for Vallenlonga from members of the Shirley family, who say they and their potential contributions to the film were shut out.
When Ali won the supporting actor Oscar, Shirley's family was on Skype.
"Everybody was happy for Mahershala Ali and the first words out of his mouth was thank you to Dr. Don Shirley," said Shirley's niece, Jasmin Shirley.
But jubilation turned to anger when it was announced that the "Green Book" received an Oscar for Best Original Screen Play," and then Best Picture.
"I was livid. ...There was no recognition of my Uncle Don or our family," Jasmin Shirley said. Indeed, director Spike Lee seemed ready to walk out of the auditorium over the best picture win, and the Twitterati seemed miffed that Hollywood picked a white savior film over "Black Panther" and Spike Lee's "BlacKkKlansman."
In their acceptance speeches, director Peter Farelly and screenplay writer Nick Vallenlonga never mentioned the Shirley family, but in a post-awards media press conference Vallenlonga, son of Anthony Vallenlonga, addressed the controversy.
"If you are discussing the Don Shirley family thing, that falls on me," Vallenlonga said.
"Don Shirley himself told me himself not to speak to anyone. He told me the story that he wanted to tell."
But members of Shirley's family say the depiction of Don Shirley is just not true. For starters, they say Vallenlonga was hired to drive Shirley on a tour of historically black colleges and universities, not a tour of segregated venues across the South. The lens through which the story is framed is another issue.
"The thing that bothers our family is the focus of the film is all about a white man who was an extreme racist who was still a racist at the end," said Karole Shirley Kimble, daughter of Shirley's brother Maurice. "Clearly, our family has a legacy of black excellence and family pride. Our concern is that (this) white director presented one person's perspective."
What is not in dispute is that Vallenlonga used the real "Green Book" to find places for he and Shirley to eat and sleep. The guidebook was created by Victor Green, a New York city postal worker, and published between 1936 and 1967. It was as cherished as the family bible for many African American families who often made long trips across the country on dark highways lined with segregated corridors and hate.
The book grew in popularity and size thanks to J.D. Rockefeller and his Esso gas stations, but fell out of favor in the 1960s once accommodations were integrated. A Smithsonian Channel documentary, "The Green Book Guide to Freedom," featuring home movies of African American families, debuts Monday night.
Kimble said had the movie makers asked the family, they would have gotten a more realistic view of Shirley's tour.
"They didn't (include) my family," Kimble said. "They didn't listen to the other side of the story. They listened to other whites talk about my uncle."
Don Shirley was born in Pensacola, Florida, on Jan. 29, 1927. His parents were Jamaican immigrants. His father, Edwin, was an Episcopal priest and his mother, Stella, worked as a schoolteacher. She died two days after delivering Shirley's brother, Maurice, who eventually became a psychologist. Two other brothers, Calvin Hilton Shirley and Edwin Shirley Jr., became physicians. Donald Shirley earned three doctorates.
"Grandfather Shirley believed that there was a time to work and a time to play. He believed in the scripture that obedience is better than sacrifice and he molded his children and grandchildren in that way," said Kimble, adding that after their mother died the brothers worked hard at cooking and cleaning so that their father wouldn't get married again. But Edwin Shirley did marry again after he moved the family to Fort Lauderdale, and he and his new wife had a daughter, Edwina.
A prodigy, Shirley began playing piano at age 2. By 9, he was studying music theory at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music. He started playing professionally in 1955 at age 18 with the Boston Pops, performing Tchaikovsky's "Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat."
"At every stop his family was there," said Jasmin Shirley, adding that he learned to play from his mother, who was the organist at St. Cyprian Episcopal Church in Pensacola.
The Shirleys lived in St. Cyprian's parsonage, in the shadows of the Belmont-DeVilliers neighborhood, a booming African American business corridor in 1930s Pensacola. The area was filled with churches, business owners, medical professionals, funeral homes and large family homes.
"I remember the Shirley boys playing in this house," said Maggie Polkinghorne Wilson, 84, whose brother was Lt. James Porkinghorne, a Tuskegee Airman and World War II pilot.
Shirley attended the Catholic University of America as well as the University of Chicago, and earned doctorates of music, psychology and liturgical arts. But he became disenchanted with musical performance.
In a video from a planned, never completed documentary with the working title of "Let It Shine: Don Shirley," (2018) he is filmed in his New York City apartment above Carnegie Hall where he talked about his goals.
"I was dead set on being, all my life, what I was trained to be, although I had to go through the back doors of the nightclub," Shirley said.
Despite performing with symphonies in Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and other cities, Shirley ended up taking the advice of New York theater producer Sol Hurok, who told him that white audiences in the United States were not ready for a "colored" playing classical piano on the concert stage. He was better received in overseas venues from Africa to Europe.
"He was a child prodigy but he couldn't be a classical pianist because of the color of his skin. You can hear the pain in his voice. You can see his anger. He was angry because he was disrespected," Jasmin Shirley said of the documentary.
The film portrays Shirley as a lonely man who was estranged from his family. But Kimble said Don Shirley kept up with his family until he died on April 6, 2013.
"His biggest treat was traveling to Milan, Italy, and performing at Lascala, the world's largest opera house," Karole said.
Shirley recorded hundreds of pieces, and two of his favorites was a remake of "Bridge Over Trouble Waters," and "This Little Light of Mine."
Shirley blended classical music with jazz and pop music to create his own style. But to his own frustration, most of his performances were in nightclubs instead of concert halls.
"They smoke while they're playing, and they'll put the glass of whisky on the piano, and then they'll get mad when they're not respected like Arthur Rubinstein", Shirley said in a 1982 New York Times interview. "You don't see Arthur Rubinstein smoking and putting a glass on the piano. ... The black experience through music, with a sense of dignity, that's all I have ever tried to do."

Texto completo: As I watched it on Netflix, I found I couldn’t much like “Roma,” a top Oscars contender that the streaming service is massively promoting for best picture. I started mulling over why I felt so at odds with near universal opinion and read some of the effusive reviews (Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian: “thrilling, engrossing, moving”). I found I liked them even less.
If Alfonso Cuarón, the director, had limited himself to the alternately subtle and violent portrait he draws of the Mexico City of his youth — a city I came to love, for all its problems, when I lived there many years later — I would have applauded. And I doubt “Roma” would have received nearly such wide attention or praise.
“A personal epic set in Mexico City in the early 1970s,” writes Manohla Dargis in The New York Times, the film “centers on a young indigenous woman who works as a maid for a middle-class, white family. ” “Roma” thus caught a wave of concern about racial inequality. Cuarón even underlined the point by dedicating it to his actual nanny, also indigenous. Just how does a white, upper-class director’s personal epic center on an indigenous woman?

Oscars 2019: 'Green Book' shows Hollywood's blatant contempt for Italian-Americans
'Black Panther' empowers students of color by highlighting Africa's centuries of greatness
Celebrate 'Crazy Rich Asians,' flaws and all. It has redefined Hollywood and being Asian.
'A Star is Born': What the movie gets wrong about treatment for alcohol, opioid addiction
Parenthetically, contrary to what critics say, this was not a middle-class Mexican family. Only 2 percent of Mexicans of that era had even attended university. The father in the film is an accomplished doctor, the mother a biochemist. The family is upper-class, full stop.
Cleo, the indigenous nanny, does get the most camera time. We see details of her life from dawn to dusk: waking the children and putting them to sleep, mutely washing dog dirt from the Ford Galaxie’s tiled parking spot, wiping the mouthpiece of a phone to clean off germs after answering it. We also see, in Cleo, the emotional ties that have forever bound poor, indigenous Mexico to wealthier, lighter-skinned Mexico. But the human being who must lurk somewhere between the quotidian details and socioeconomic symbol is hardly visible.
Cleo's character is lost in upper-class perspective
Cleo speaks in telegraphic phrases, at best. In a typical scene, the wife of the household, abandoned by her husband, comes home from a drunken spree and mutters to her: “No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone. ” The statement is about women in general, not an indigenous woman, and the person who articulates it is upper-class. Cleo just stares back.
We see virtually nothing of Cleo’s life outside the family orbit. She’s from “a dusty Mixtec village somewhere in Oaxaca,” Ty Burr colorfully writes in The Boston Globe. Actually, we aren’t told the village is dusty, only that she’s from the poor state of Oaxaca, an entry on a résumé. We learn in passing that the government expropriated her family farm but not even what was grown there. We have no idea why she left to find her destiny in Mexico City, what her ambitions, hopes and fears might be.
A report in Variety on the backstory underlines this lacuna. Liboria Rodríguez, the director’s actual childhood nanny, it turns out, often talked to him “about her hardships as a girl, about feeling cold or hungry. ” She would tell about “her father, who used to play an ancient Mesoamerican ballgame that’s almost lost to the ages now, or about witch doctors who would try to cure people in her village. ”
'Roma' doesn't build bridges or tear down walls
Why did no such stories make it into “Roma”? Not for Cuarón’s lack of access to them. While filming, he called Rodríguez obsessively to check details. “He was getting all this information without me knowing what it was for,” she told Variety.
“Then it started to become weird,” she continued. He would ask, “Libo, what did you used to wear? How did you dress?” But he asked about externals, not concerns, ambitions, thoughts.
In short, the film is, indeed, “a personal epic. ” It's not about Cleo but the auteur behind the camera — his gratitude toward the nanny shown taking the future director to the cinema, his guilt about her subordinate position, his everything.
Why did so many critics laud “Roma”? Aside from waxing eloquent about its photography — “dynamically shot in a pellucid black and white,” Bradshaw writes, fairly enough — they seem to buy its conceit, holding up the indigenous in the abstract while merely glancing over indigenous peoples in concrete. It's an attitude not unlike that of the global upper middle-class toward poor immigrants.
When he won awards for best foreign-language film and best director at the Golden Globes, Cuarón said fine cinema “tears down walls and builds bridges” to other cultures: “We begin to understand exactly how much we have in common. ” But “Roma” does not build bridges to Cleo or tear down walls that separate her. It uses her to broadcast a story about upper-class Mexico.

Response to child abuse: Too little, too late?

Resumen: The Catholic and Southern Baptist churches are among the happiest at President Donald Trump’s nominations of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court because — you guessed it — both oppose abortion in all cases. (A large majority of Baptist churches around here are not Southern Baptist but American Baptist.) Southern Baptists ministers may marry. Serene Jones, president of the Union Theological Seminary in New York City, told Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times, “Both the Catholic and Southern Baptist churches have very masculine understandings of God and have a structure where men are considered the closest representatives of God.”

Texto completo: The power of religion, despite the decline in the number of practitioners, must be strong if there are still people today who believe and practice in spite of the scandals within major religions. Especially sexual scandals.
In the past week, Pope Francis has convened a Vatican summit to address the issue of priests and bishops sexually assaulting children and of others covering up the crimes.
We have known for years that priests and bishops were doing this and little has been done to stop it or to punish the criminals. The Boston Globe won a Pulitzer Prize in 2002 for uncovering the abuse of children by scores of Catholic priests in the Archdiocese of Boston. In 1989, the Catholic Church in Newfoundland was called out for permitting widespread abuse of children in an orphanage. The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops called on the larger church to take steps to curb child abuse. Nothing happened.
As archbishop of Buenos Aires, Pope Francis was accused of wini-wink-nudge-nudge when priests were accused of sexually abusing children. His first few years as pope weren’t much better. He even pushed through canonization of John Paul II, under whom priestly crimes in Boston and Washington were committed and ignored or denied. But Francis may have seen the light. On Feb. 16, he booted from the priesthood Theodore McCarrick, who had committed sexual abuse and covered up the abuse by others before and during his tenure as Archbishop of Washington, D.C.
On Feb. 12, the Houston Chronicle published an investigation that showed the Catholics aren’t alone. The Chronicle documented more than 380 cases of ministers and volunteers in the Southern Baptist Convention sexually misbehaving, including child abuse.
The victims were often ostracized by their churches or were told to forgive their abusers or told to get abortions. This all sounded too familiar. On Thursday, an African woman told Pope Francis’s summit on child abuse that she had been repeatedly raped by her pastor, who three times ordered her to have an abortion after he had impregnated her.
The Catholic and Southern Baptist churches are among the happiest at President Donald Trump’s nominations of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court because — you guessed it — both oppose abortion in all cases. Can you say hypocrisy?
Many early commentators attributed the abuse of children to the celibacy required of Catholic priests. Then along came the Southern Baptists. (A large majority of Baptist churches around here are not Southern Baptist but American Baptist.)
Southern Baptists ministers may marry. So, clearly, the problem of men of the cloth sexually abusing children and others doesn’t trace solely to celibacy. There has to be another source or sources to explain the depth and breadth of the abuse.
Let me suggest that there are two sources of the sexual abuse by men of the cloth
The first part is sex itself. When an institution focuses so sharply on sexual behavior, should it surprise us that those who rebel against or within the institution would choose sexual behavior for their rebellion? Or even fail to see their behavior as troubling? If you saw the movie “Spotlight,” you were likely staggered when a serial-abusing priest told Sacha Pfeiffer of the Globe that his abuse was not a sin because he didn’t enjoy it.
At a seminar of the Maine Conference of the United Church of Christ (Congregational) in 2011, Catholic theologian John Dominic Crossan told us that we Christians for centuries have obsessed over sexual behavior. Better, he said, we should obsess over violence. Who is doing what and to whom is a far deeper theological and philosophical question, Crossan told our meeting in Falmouth, than who is sleeping with whom.
Yes, the Bible lays out prescriptions and proscriptions about sexual behavior. But the Bible also implores us: “So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the prophets.” That’s Matthew 7:12, a dictate to us from the Prince of Peace, speaking in the Sermon on the Mount.
The second source I see is that so many churches, including Catholics and Southern Baptists, allow only men to be pastors. The view of God passed down through centuries has been passed almost exclusively by male clerics. It should not surprise us that men interpreting God to the rest of us see God in their own image. As a male.
Serene Jones, president of the Union Theological Seminary in New York City, told Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times, “Both the Catholic and Southern Baptist churches have very masculine understandings of God and have a structure where men are considered the closest representatives of God.”
Jonathan Walton, a professor of Christian morals at Harvard, said, “Prohibiting women from the highest ranks of formal leadership fosters a fundamentally toxic masculinity.”
It wasn’t always thus. As Kristof wrote, “The paradox is that Jesus and the early Christian church seem to have been very open to women. The only person in the New Testament who wins an argument with Jesus is an unnamed woman who begs him to heal her daughter (Mark 7:24-30 and Matthew 15:21-28).”
Further, Kristof cites a second-century Gnostic text suggesting that Jesus trusted Mary Magdalene to instruct his disciples in religion. But male hierarchies took over early in Christianity, and women were mostly barred from religious leadership.
Even though other religions, including my own, have struggled with issues of sexual abuse of children, it seems to happen a lot less among those denominations whose ministers are both women and men.

'Merchants' casts grim eye on news business

Texto completo: One of the facts bemoaned by traditional journalists in the current state of the news business is that, with a growing banquet of news to offer on any given day, in any given hour, consumers are opting for boiled down listicles and scannable reads.
It's the antithesis in style to what The New York Times used to embody, particularly by its former senior editorial leader, Jill Abramson, the first woman to serve as the paper's Washington bureau chief, managing editor and executive editor – the top job in American print journalism.
But as everyone knows , Abramson didn't last long at the top; just three years. In May 2014, she was fired for allegedly poor management and being too "difficult" for even hard-boiled Times journalists to handle.
Her account of what happened as laid out in her new book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," is absorbing and fair – and it's likely the first section many journalists will turn to.
"There was no simple reason I was fired. I was a less than stellar manager, but I also had been judged by an unfair double standard applied to many women leaders. Most of all, I became the first woman editor at a very bad time in journalism," she writes.
Now comes "Merchants," published Tuesday (Simon & Schuster, ).
Reviews have been generally positive, mixed with sharp criticism. There already has been a contretemps over whether she accused the Times of being biased against President Donald Trump in its coverage. She batted that away as an exaggeration of something taken out of context. A fair reading backs her up.
Now she and her publisher are dealing with more serious charges of factual errors and plagiarism lodged late Wednesday in a series of tweets on Twitter by a reporter for one of the four news organizations she examines in the book, Vice – which under her gaze does not come off as a journalistic paragon.
Simon & Schuster issued a statement Thursday promising revisions if warranted in the 534-page book. Abramson also issued a statement to USA TODAY that the passages in question involve facts that were imperfectly cited in her 70 pages of footnotes. "I wouldn't want even a misplaced comma so I will promptly fix these footnotes and quotations as I have corrected other material that Vice contested," she said.
Meanwhile, the book as published documents the crisis: Journalism may have not yet been annihilated but the barbarians are at the gate and banging hard. More news than ever is out there and more people than ever are in need of reliable information in order for democracy to function, Abramson observes.
At the same time, she reports, the journalism business model is stuttering and a steadier replacement is not yet obvious. Every news company struggles to produce a product for the digital age amid sharp staff cuts, while more consumers, marinated in "the internet is free!" assumptions, are unwilling to pay for it, Abramson says.
The author explores this grim state through the experiences of two legacy media titans, her former employer, the Times, and the Washington Post, fighting to retain their "values" in a maelstrom, and two digital titans, BuzzFeed and Vice, "improbable players" in an arena where social media drives large numbers of consumers to news.
"I was determined to capture this moment of wrenching transition – and to do it as a reporter, my first calling," Abramson writes.
She has her pet peeves: The sometimes dishonest nature of clickbait headlines, designed to capture attention but promising more than they deliver. Tedious business meetings watching PowerPoint presentations of eye-glazing data charts. The "ridiculously" few women in senior editing jobs at the Times, a deficit she is most proud of improving during her tenure.
She is alarmed about the chipping away of the traditional wall between the news side and the business side. When the new CEO of the Times told her he expected new "revenue-producing products" to come from the newsroom, she snapped, "If that's what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor ... The truth had flown out of my mouth before I could edit either its substance or tone."
Abramson doesn't see an entirely trouble-free future for any of her examined news organizations, despite their various successes. "All four are endangered," she warns. That even goes for the Post, which was rescued in 2013 by its "white knight," Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who bought the family-owned paper for $250 million with the idea that "restoring its glory would be a contribution to democracy."
For legacy media survivors, following the trials and tribulations of two newspapers may involve equal measures of envy, dread and schadenfreude. BuzzFeed and Vice may seem like alien entities.
Abramson traces how BuzzFeed began with a steady diet viral cat videos, but founder and "virality" genius Jonah Peretti and his team figured out how to connect with a mostly disaffected young audience through their emotions – at the "beating heart of the internet." They pioneered a new business model – native advertising – and by the end of 2011, BuzzFeed had "pivoted" to original news reporting, beefing up its reporting staff with a goal of being taken seriously.
Vice started out as a print lads mag constantly pushing the bounds of bad taste in the quest to be "edgy," which led to such outrages as "The Racist Issue." In 2017, Vice's 18 hours of footage of the deadly Charlottesville, Va., Unite the Right rally garnered a total of 50 million views and became the "defining image" of the violence, Abramson says.
Non-journalists may find "Merchants" dense and complicated, with something surprising or infuriating on every page. Journalists working today already know in their guts most of what Abramson is reporting, if not in the depressing detail she presents.
Abramson earns three stars for her thoroughness and insights, but this is not a beach read, and certainly not a happy read. Unless, of course, you believe journalists are the enemy of the people.
Jill Abramson and "Merchants of Truth" are facing charges plagiarism.

Texto completo: Few suspected criminals volunteer to be considered for placement in a maximum-security prison. But that is what a former Alabama resident has done. Hoda Muthana, who joined the Islamic State group in 2014, is offering herself up to the virtual certainty of a long stay in the Graybar Hotel. The Trump administration, however, has rejected the offer.
Muthana, 24, now resides in a refugee camp in Syria with her toddler son after escaping from the terrorists she once embraced. After traveling to Syria to help the group wage war, she married an Islamic State fighter -- under compulsion, she says. Her Twitter account urged the killing of President Barack Obama and other Americans, though her family's lawyer says others controlled the account.
She now says she was "ignorant" and "brainwashed" and expresses deep regret for what she did. Muthana wants to return to the United States to face justice, however stern. John Walker Lindh, who joined the Taliban and fought against U.S. allies in Afghanistan, got a 20-year sentence, some of which he has spent in the notorious supermax facility in Colorado.
But Donald Trump prefers permanent banishment. "I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!" he tweeted. Pompeo affirmed that she "is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States."
Muthana was born in New Jersey, and birth on American soil automatically confers U.S. citizenship -- as Trump knows, because he wants to abolish that policy. The administration, however, claims that she falls into the sole exception provided in the 14th Amendment.
Children of foreign diplomats don't qualify, because the amendment excludes them as not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the U.S. government. Muthana's father was a Yemeni diplomat who originally came here to serve at the United Nations
But that doesn't necessarily matter. Her lawyer has produced documentation that her father left the diplomatic corps nearly two months before she was born and became a permanent resident, making her eligible for birthright citizenship. (The family later moved to Hoover, Ala., where she grew up.)
This should not come as news to the State Department. New York Times correspondent Rukmini Callimachi reported that "when Muthana first received her U.S. passport when she was a child, her father was asked to produce proof that he had been discharged from his diplomatic post. Authorities reviewed her case, says her family lawyer, and handed her not just her first passport but also her second."
The State Department is contradicting a judgment it reached on two previous occasions -- occasions when, unlike today, it had no ulterior motive to rule against her. The clear presumption is that Muthana is an American, deserving of the same protections as any other citizen. Those include the freedom to return to her native country, even if she may have committed crimes against it.
It's possible the administration can demonstrate she wasn't entitled to citizenship in the first place. But that determination should be made only after impartial consideration of the evidence, which is not what anyone would expect from this administration. Given Trump's mode of operation, it's fair to assume that the decision to exclude Muthana was reached first and the pretext devised later.
If she has committed crimes and remains dangerous, you would think the administration would be eager to repatriate her to face prosecution and imprisonment. If neither is true, you would think the administration would not be so adamant about rejecting her right to return.
People are sometimes recognized as U.S. citizens by mistake. But when mistakes are discovered, the usual practice of the government is to grant permanent resident status to those involved, not to expel them.
Yes, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is a terrorist group that Muthana voluntarily joined. But Lindh did the same with the Taliban -- and he was an active fighter, not the spouse of one. Like him, Muthana can be criminally charged for her activities on behalf of an enemy. All she wants is to submit to the decisions of our criminal justice system.
Interviewed on NPR, her family's lawyer, Hassan Shibly, was asked whether she is ready to go to prison for decades. "Absolutely," he replied. "That's what she's asking for."
Muthana is willing to trust our courts to decide her fate. The administration is not. That's because both sides know who stands to gain from the law and the truth -- and who stands to lose.

Texto completo: Paul Manafort "repeatedly and brazenly violated the law" and shows a "hardened adherence to committing crimes," prosecutors told a federal judge in Washington in their sentencing memo for President Trump's former campaign chairman.
But they recommended no specific punishment for the crimes detailed in his Washington case, saying that is the practice of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, whose office brought the case.
Prosecutors noted that federal guidelines call for a sentence of 17 to 22 years, although under Manafort's guilty plea in his Washington case, the maximum he faces behind bars is 10 years. The special counsel team said it may ask Judge Amy Berman Jackson to impose a sentence that runs after any prison time Manafort is given for related crimes in Virginia federal court.

"Manafort chose repeatedly and knowingly to violate the law," prosecutors said, from "garden-variety crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and bank fraud" to "more esoteric laws" involving foreign lobbying.
He lied, they said, "to tax preparers, bookkeepers, banks, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice National Security Division, the FBI, the Special Counsel's Office, the grand jury, his own legal counsel, members of Congress, and members of the executive branch of the United States government."
He committed crimes while leading a presidential campaign and while out on bail before trial, and then lied to investigators after pleading guilty, prosecutors said, revealing "a hardened adherence to committing crimes and lack of remorse."
The charges in both cases flow from Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The filing helps pave the way for Manafort's sentencings in Washington and Virginia scheduled for next month, as Mueller is thought to be beginning to wrap up his inquiry.
But the redacted public document gives no details about Manafort's campaign interactions with Russians. Prosecutors had previously asked the judge for permission to seal material either because it related to "ongoing law enforcement investigations" or "uncharged individuals."
As part of a plea deal in September, Manafort, 69, acknowledged he was guilty of everything he was accused of in Washington and Virginia: making millions as an unregistered lobbyist for Ukrainian politicians, hiding that money to avoid paying taxes, defrauding banks to pay his debts when his oligarch patrons fell out of power, and lying to cover up his crimes while trying to persuade witnesses to do the same.
When he appears in front of Jackson on March 13, he will already have been sentenced March 8 for related crimes in federal court in Alexandria, Va., barring any change in the scheduling for those hearings. Jackson could make the sentence she imposes run during or after his Virginia prison term. In Virginia, where Manafort was found guilty of bank and tax fraud at trial, there is no upper limit to his sentence.
In Alexandria, prosecutors have asked only for a "serious" sentence. Federal guidelines in that case call for him to spend 19 to 24 years in prison.
Mueller's prosecutors have been handing off other pending matters to the U.S. attorney's office for D.C., and the Department of Justice is readying for Mueller to formally conclude his work.
In New York, the Manhattan district attorney is preparing to charge Manafort with violating state tax laws and committing other financial crimes, a move designed to ensure Trump's former campaign chief spends time in prison if the president pardons him for the convictions stemming from Mueller's investigation, Bloomberg News and the New York Times reported Friday.
Trump has not indicated whether he intends to pardon Manafort, though he repeatedly expressed support for him as his trial played out last year. New York's double-jeopardy law, which protects defendants from being prosecuted twice for the same crimes, could pose a challenge for the district attorney's office, however.
Attorneys for Manafort are not due to file their sentencing recommendation in Washington until Monday. Jackson granted them a delay after they said a snowstorm last week made it harder to meet with their client in the Alexandria jail where he has been held.
Under Manafort's plea agreement in Washington, federal prosecutors had agreed to ask Jackson to give him credit at sentencing for cooperation. But because she found he lied to investigators and breached that agreement, they are no longer bound by it.
Jackson found Manafort lied about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime aide who the FBI assessed to have ties to Russian intelligence. Those contacts, prosecutors said in court, go "very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating."
Manafort gave inconsistent accounts of an August 2016 meeting in New York City at which he and Kilimnik discussed a "peace plan" for Ukraine, a top foreign policy priority for Russia. At the time, Manafort was still leading Trump's campaign. He also lied about sharing polling data with Kilimnik in 2016, prosecutors said in describing how he broke his deal to cooperate truthfully.
The judge also concluded that Manafort lied about a payment that he claimed was a loan, and as part of another Justice Department investigation whose focus has not been described publicly.
Defense attorneys have maintained that Manafort did not intentionally give false information and that any inconsistencies were honest mistakes.
In 2017, Kilimnik denied to the Washington Post having connections to Russian intelligence. He was indicted with Manafort on charges of conspiring to obstruct justice through witness tampering.
Kilimnik is believed to be in Moscow and therefore probably safe from arrest because Russia does not extradite its citizens.

THE OSCARS / THE ACADEMY; Let's set things aright again; Criticism of the academy is fast and loud, but the Oscar group could help itself

Texto completo: I come not to bury the academy but not necessarily to praise it either. Rather I come, with a nod to Jonathan Swift, with a modest proposal for people to cut it a little slack.
I know, I know, mistakes, as the saying goes, have been made. But exactly what were they? What circumstances influenced the decisions? And more to the point, did the severity of the punishment fit the crime?
Or does the savageness of the anti-academy response, the waves of rabid protesters attacking the institution like it was a Taliban stronghold and they were tireless "World War Z" zombies have more to do with the piling-on culture we live in than whatever infractions were actually committed?

By this time everyone who even remotely cares already knows, or at least thinks they know, what happened. First the academy announced that, in the service of brevity, the Oscars in four categories -- cinematography, editing, live-action short, and makeup and hairstyling -- would be presented during commercial breaks, with acceptance speeches taped and broadcast later in the program.
Then, after the aforementioned outraged attacks were mounted by a slew of celebrity filmmakers (even Seth Rogen, the inciting of North Korea with "The Interview" under his belt, got into the act), the academy gave ground and went back to business as usual.
Given that the raison d'etre of the awards ceremony is, not surprisingly, to present awards, why did the academy announce those measures in the first place? The answer, at the end of the day, is money.
It is generally conceded that the show's length, which regularly exceeds three hours, is gradually eroding ratings: an estimated 26.5 million watched last year compared to 43.7 million in 2015.
And, as the New York Times' Brooks Barnes concisely pointed out, "the Oscars telecast is a big business, generating 83 percent of the academy's $148 million in annual revenue. ABC controls broadcast rights until 2028 at a cost of roughly $75 million per year."
Understandably concerned with its own fiscal stability, especially with big-ticket items like its new film museum on the horizon, the academy was also facing fierce pressure from ABC -- an entity that doesn't care about reputation, tradition or anything outside of financial returns.
So, likely taking into account as well the perennial generic gripes about the show's length, the academy came up with a carefully worked out, nuanced plan, approved by its 50-plus-member Board of Governors.
Though you would never know it from the rabid tweets that resulted, the plan was never to banish those four categories, simply to postpone their presence on the show. Also, even that postponement was not permanent: The categories affected would rotate, with a different four (or more) selected every year in consultation with the various academy branches.
In the interest of full disclosure, I have to say that I didn't feel that plan was the best one possible. (More about that later.) But a board of the academy's size is inevitably prone to factions, and this must have been as good a plan as could be worked out under the circumstances.
However, there were several things the academy didn't count on, starting with its own nature.
For though journalists tend to describe it in monolithic terms, the academy is nothing of the sort. It's not Google, Apple or Amazon; it's more like Germany's medieval Hanseatic League, a group of separate entities joined to protect and promote their individual interests.
So when the cinematographers and editors came to very publicly feel that what was good for the academy as an institution was not good for them as individual crafts, the wheels started to fall off the carefully constructed deal.
A second thing the academy didn't take into account was the scorched-earth nature of the online world in general and Twitter specifically. An entity that does not do well with nuance and is happiest when people are unhappy, Twitter made mincemeat of the academy's delicately worked-out plan -- so distorting its qualities that I had people come up to me on the street and ask why the Oscars were eliminating the cinematography and editing Oscars. Really.
Finally, unlikely as it seems, the academy may not have counted on the complexity of both the public and the membership's love-hate attitudes toward it as an institution. Just as adult children can occasionally be heard blaming all their ills on their parents, movie fans as well as industry types are emotionally attached to the institution but enjoy grumbling about it, which leads to the academy being whipsawed into "damned if they do, damned if they don't" situations. Yes, people have been complaining for forever about the length of the Oscar program, but no one so much as paused to give the group credit for making an attempt -- however flawed -- when the since-discarded plan surfaced.
Similarly, when the academy took steps to address the diversity issue a few years ago, those upset with what happened -- "they went too far"; "they didn't go far enough" -- all but drowned out any positive thoughts. People, in sum, are more invested in giving the academy a hard time than in having it improve, more invested in getting angry at the organization above all else, no matter what it does.
So, taking all this into account, what should be done to shorten the show? There are logical steps to take, but there are reasons the academy hasn't gone there.
As proposed many times, most recently by Kristopher Tapley in Variety and seconded by the New York Times' Kyle Buchanan, the trio of short film awards could be given their own program, an echo of the very popular Governors Awards, and Tapley adds, the two sound categories could be combined as well.
Though the world has changed mightily since shorts were a feature of every theatrical program, the shorts branch has retained its ability to negotiate effectively within the academy -- two of the categories were nearly eliminated outright in 1992 until high-profile supporters including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg stepped in -- and the idea of any changes has gone nowhere.
No matter what the academy does next, it has to make its peace with the fact that people are invested in slamming their actions out of all proportion to reality. As far as the eternal complainers, they should understand that, with institutions as well as individuals, it's intelligent encouragement and not snark that creates the atmosphere for change.
Do the stakeholders actually want the best show possible? Or do they want to play politics and complain? We shall see.

Texto completo: In The Edit, a New York Times newsletter for college students and recent graduates, we asked for stories about mental health on campus. The responses below have been edited and condensed.
Amanda Lutz, 32
Winona State University
I am divorced, and I live with my parents. I moved home to Minnesota from Texas and decided to continue pursuing my bachelor's in psychology that I had abandoned after having started school in the fall of 2005. I have been attending classes part time while working full time to keep my health insurance since the summer of 2016.
I am on track to graduate next fall. All the while, I have been fighting with chronic pain from a horseback-riding accident and managing depression. Some days I have purpose and a drive to succeed, and other days I just want to give up. If you really want something in this life, you have to find that resilience to pursue it and just keep going. Kyrah Altman, 22
George Washington University
As a result of growing up in a broken and traumatic home, I began experiencing severe anxiety and depression in middle school. While it followed me throughout high school and college, I channeled my struggle with mental illness into the founding of a social enterprise, LEAD (Let's Empower, Advocate and Do), that provides mental health training and curriculum to schools, camps and youth-serving organizations across the country.
I am a senior undergraduate student and was recently named the third-best student entrepreneur in the country in the Entrepreneurs' Organization Global Student Entrepreneurship Awards. Anna Shutley, 19
Wake Forest University
I have struggled with clinical depression and anxiety since my sophomore year of high school. I am a sophomore in college, and I am very passionate about mental health and working to improve it.
I read a lot of self-help books in high school, but most were written by a 50-year-old psychologist who knows what they're talking about in a clinical sense, but not how it actually feels to be 16 and struggling with suicidal thoughts and panic attacks. Because of this, I decided to write a short book with practical advice for improving your outlook on the world and how to incorporate caring for your mental health into your routine through mindfulness, exercise, limited phone time and leaving room for what brings you joy in life.
I have conducted a workshop at my high school on improving mental health and also do my best to bring that conversation to Wake Forest.
My main philosophy is about learning how to make Tuesday your favorite day of the week, because if you're always waiting for the weekend or Christmas or your graduation, you are deciding that your happiness is circumstantial, and that therefore you don't control it, your environment does. However, if you decide that amid the boring, mundane, stressful and sometimes heartbreaking realities of life, that you are going to focus on what is good and build your life around that instead, you are taking back the control that you deserve over your own happiness.
Rachael Cohen Hamilton, 22
University of Colorado Denver
I am in my second semester of graduate school, studying for my master's in public administration, with a focus in gender-based violence. Within my first weeks of being here I witnessed a homeless woman being raped outside of my apartment and obviously called 911.
This in many ways was triggering to me, and I went into my first semester of grad school suffering from pretty severe post-traumatic stress disorder, from both this and a previous incident. This is all happening as the Kavanaugh hearings are happening, and I am taking my first gender-based violence class of my program. As I was taking the bus to and from work every day, I was entirely dissociative.
I likely could not tell you what happened my entire first month of grad school, that's how detached I was from reality at that time. Luckily, I took the day off for Rosh Hashana and went to the market, and I was able to snap back into reality in a lot of ways. That day I made an appointment with my campus's sexual assault resource center. It was able to get me extensions on assignments, set me up with a therapist and wrote a letter of support for my department allowing me to drop the gender-based violence class and receive a full refund.
I also saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed beta blockers, which have helped bring down my heightened sense of danger wherever I go. This semester, having had time to help heal, I've been able to restart my concentration in gender-based violence, which is more important to me now than ever, and I was still able to complete my other two graduate courses last semester and remain a full-time student.
It was so important for me to write you, to emphasize the importance of institutional support. I still struggle sometimes, but I think that without them helping me, I likely would have had no choice but to drop out and move back home. Fiona P. Pham, 21
Johns Hopkins University
I always knew that coming to study at another university in a foreign country is tough. You sleep and breathe in English, you learn to embrace flip flops in the classroom. You adapt. And that was part of my plan.
I embrace new opportunities, learn as much as I can, make mistakes, make friends, have first drinks, pull all-nighters. But depression was never part of my plan. I didn't even know it had a name until everything felt empty.
So, here I was, FaceTiming my mother without the video because I could not let her see my face. My voice sounds fine, telling her I was fine, schoolwork is challenging but manageable -- I am applying to summer internships, competition is rough, but it's fine. And everything was fine. Except me.
The first time I had a counseling session was weird. It felt weird that I was living my dream, studying in the United States, having supportive family and friends, and yet I was sitting in that chair. I learned that sometimes there was no definite reason for the way I felt. But at least, when I acknowledged that I was not mentally healthy, it was the beginning of my healing process.
Every day I try to make healthier choices and balance all aspects of my life. I go to counseling. I practice mindfulness. I talk to my support network. The chemicals in my brain sometimes act up, but I know I just need to be extra patient that day.
If there is a mental health group on your campus that could provide support, definitely check it out. Every single time you feel that you are trapped in your head, remember that every little step to make yourself feel better is a step, as long as you don't stop.

Texto completo: It’s soup weather for all, but especially for yours truly, who is trying to shake his “touch of pneumonia,” in the doctor’s phrase.
Soup has become a frequent meal, whether it’s out of a can or bag or served in a restaurant. In the past three weeks I’ve had chicken and wild rice, chicken and vegetables, tomato rice, Italian wedding, cioppino, spinach, consommé, ramen and, by the time you read this, birria.
Last weekend, I had home-cooked chicken noodle soup courtesy of reader Trudi Blair.
Blair, who figured into a 2017 column on St. George’s Church in Ontario, told me then: “Although I have nothing to prove it, I believe I am your No. 1 fan.”
She sent me a get-well card recently and included this note: “I’d love to make my chicken soup because it heals everyone and also it’s delicious.”
Chicken soup for the columnist’s soul? I’ll take it.
I phoned her that Friday. She had fresh soup for me. “I made it yesterday when it was raining and raining,” she said. It has, she said, “lots of vegetables,” chicken and baby pasta.
Describing her well-rounded concoction, Blair said: “This will give you vegetables, starch, protein and vegetables.” I guess it does have a lot of vegetables.
“Do you need crackers?” she asked.
She gave me directions to her Ontario residence and I stopped by on my way home.
Blair had made up a take-home bag for me with a plastic container of soup, a bag of low-salt crackers, a carton of Goldfish crackers, a bag of Pink Lady apples, a bag of cookies and a container of chocolates.
Worthy of note: She is 90.
As I write this, I’ve finished the soup, the crackers, the cookies and the apples, with about half the Goldfish and all the chocolates left. I can’t say I’m healed, but I’m full.
While it’s not for me to decide whether or not Trudi Blair is my No. 1 fan, especially when there’s a reader who delivered Vince’s Spaghetti to my doorstep, let me say this: I’m a fan of Trudi Blair.
Legends in Pomona
When they were in high school, future baseball greats Jackie Robinson (of Muir Tech in Pasadena) and Ted Williams (of Hoover High in San Diego) played in the 1935 and 1936 Pomona High School Baseball Tournament, sponsored by the 20-30 Club.
“At the time, this was one of the largest sporting events in the area, attracting thousands of spectators,” said Scott Schroeder, a baseball enthusiast who’s been researching the tournament.
“It’s pretty amazing that Jackie Robinson and Ted Williams were both in this high school tournament, with no idea what the future had in store for them,” Schroeder added. “They were just high school kids.”
He’s been trying to track down copies of the 1935 and 1936 programs and reputed panoramic photos of the teams. I don’t know that a mention here will help, but it can’t hurt. Schroeder can be contacted at scott.schroeder@iaml.com or at 949-278-2648.

It’s been a while since I’ve mentioned recent posts to my blog at insidesocal.com/davidallen.
Let’s see, I named my favorite films and records of 2018, shared my reading for the month of January (as did several readers), reminded you of the day in 1990 when Ronald Reagan and Bob Hope visited Chaffey College, and ate meals at Vita Italian Bar and Grill and Slummin’ Gourmet, both in Pomona, Old World Deli in Upland and Pola’s Mariscos in Montclair.
Old World is a great place for soup, by the way.

The New York Times ran an obituary for Tom Cade, leader of an effort that re-established the peregrine falcon on the East Coast after it had been wiped out by DDT. As reader Larry Wineinger brought to my attention, Cade, who died Feb. 6 at 91, saw his first falcon in the 1940s when hiking with a friend at the San Dimas Reservoir. “It whistled over our heads. It sounded like an artillery shell passing over us,” he said in 2008. “It caught our attention.”

Backlog of Repairs and Grounded Aircraft Plague Coast Guard After the Shutdown

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown that ended last month has taken a lasting hit on the Coast Guard, which has grounded aircraft, stopped major ship repairs and will leave parts of an air station in Puerto Rico without emergency generators for the start of hurricane season because of a backlog that will take months to process.
Internal documents obtained by The New York Times show that the Coast Guard's ship maintenance command lost at least 7,456 productive workdays -- or 28.5 years' worth of workdays -- as a direct result of the partial shutdown, which furloughed 6,400 civilian employees.
"This reality poses significant risk to operational availability of cutters and boats," the documents concluded.
The service also noted a "domino effect" that has caused delays in repairs and maintenance on its roughly 200 aircraft, which, in turn, could keep them from being immediately available.
There are "tremendous backlogs of contractor work," the documents said.
[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]
The delays are expected to significantly limit the number of ships and aircraft available for Coast Guard operations, which generally include drug interdiction as well as search-and-rescue and maritime safety missions. They will also affect the training of the uniformed and civilian Coast Guard force.
"You can get the money, but you can never get the time," said Mark F. Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It's going to hurt them for quite a while."
The shutdown ended on Jan. 25. But over 35 days, as President Trump held out for $5.7 billion in congressional funding for a border wall, most federal agencies were unable to pay their employees or contractors. That included the Coast Guard, the only branch of the military that is not part of the Pentagon.
As a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, the Coast Guard went without pay until the shutdown ended. According to the documents, the Coast Guard finance center in Virginia processed about $46,000 in mutual assistance loans -- funds often reserved for dire personal hardships -- and at least one special request for a service member who sought approval for outside employment.
During the shutdown, Coast Guard members "continued activities authorized by law that provided for national security and protected life and property," Chief Warrant Officer Barry Lane, a Coast Guard spokesman in Washington said in a statement to The Times on Friday. "The Coast Guard stopped or curtailed some specific mission activities that did not fall into those categories."
The documents, dated the day before the shutdown ended, outlined a grim forecast for the small service of 55,000 active duty, reserve and civilian employees.
Over the last decade, the Coast Guard has struggled to secure steady funding levels from Congress. It did receive a $600 million lift this month after a spending bill funded a replacement for the Polar Star, the Coast Guard's only heavy icebreaker.
But the shutdown hobbled the vessel, which the documents described as one of the Coast Guard's "highest priority" ships. The spare parts inventory for the 400-foot Polar Star's three Pratt and Whitney gas turbine engines were "below safety stock levels," the documents said, and an employee was taken off furlough to work on a maintenance contract issue for the vessel.
Other examples of the shutdown's effects on the Coast Guard included:
■ Roughly 600 employees at the Aviation Logistics Center in Elizabeth City, N.C., potentially would have to work overtime for five to seven months to make up for production lost during the impasse.
■ The number of aircraft across the Coast Guard deemed "not mission capable" doubled to 10 percent of the aircraft, from 5 percent. Twenty-five aircraft -- roughly 12 percent of the Coast Guard fleet -- that are under maintenance have had their completion dates pushed back a total of 277 days.
In the short term, that has created a weekslong delay of delivering a training helicopter to Mobile, Ala., and a surveillance aircraft to Miami. The surveillance aircraft are often used for maritime patrols and spotting drug runners.
■ In Alaska, a dry dock needed for repairs to the 110-foot cutter Liberty was closed as a result of the shutdown. The Liberty patrols some of the world's most dangerous waters, and was preparing to go to sea from its home port in Auke Bay in mid-January when one of its diesel engines seized.
■ An engine replacement in one Legend-class cutter and modifications to the small boat launching equipment in the rest of the fleet were delayed. The Legend cutters were built specifically to support Pentagon operations; the ships already were plagued by cost overruns and delays.
■ Crucial maintenance was pushed back for two "buoy tenders" -- smaller boats meant to ensure the position of navigational markers on internal waterways and rivers. One was based in Keokuk, Iowa, on the upper Mississippi River, where thousands of tons of cargo pass through annually. The other, in Chattanooga, Tenn., maintains markers in the Tennessee River and seven other rivers, as well as two creeks and one other waterway.
■ At Coast Guard Air Station Borniquen in Puerto Rico, where Hurricane Maria tore through in 2017, a project to install emergency generators for base housing "will not be in place before the start of hurricane season," which begins June 1.

Simple funny things

Texto completo: Nestle touts its Hot Pockets frozen food as "delicious," "satisfying" and "fast."
Visit www.hotpockets.com and you can read for yourself how the company has declared the microwaveable items to have "More than three decades of hearty satisfaction!" behind it.
"Our satisfying snacks," the website reads, "have been a premiere choice since 1983."
Comedian Jim Gaffigan doesn't have quite the same perspective on this snack. He likes to poke fun at the whole thing.
"You never really see that on a menu when you go out to dinner; let's see, I'll have the Caesar salad and the Hot Pocket," Gaffigan jokes during a stand-up routine posted to YouTube. "Tonight's special, we have a sea bass which is broiled and we have a Hot Pocket."
You may be able to learn more about Gaffigan's feelings regarding Hot Pockets and other things when he performs in Poughkeepsie on March 1. Gaffigan will be at the Majed J. Nesheiwat Convention Center, which was formerly known as the Mid-Hudson Civic Center, for two shows, at 7 p.m. and 9:30 p.m.
Gaffigan, who was not available for an interview, is likely to receive a warm response when he arrives in Poughkeepsie.
"He's kind of got a dry sense of humor and he talks a lot about his family life, which I can sort of relate to," said Geoff Dumas of Poughquag, who has three kids and will be attending Gaffigan's early show. "He's got a wife and kids that a lot of his comedy is centered around."
Added Dumas, "He takes simple things in life and makes them funny."
And that includes Hot Pockets. From that same video on YouTube, Gaffigan riffs hard on the snack, which features a variety of flavors, from pepperoni pizza to Philly steak and cheese, each wrapped in an enclosed crust:
"Recently they introduced the breakfast Hot Pocket . Finally. I can't think of a better way to start the day."
"I saw a commercial for a chicken pot pie Hot Pocket. Now they're just messing with us. It's just a matter of time: Have you tried the Hot Pocket Hot Pocket? It's a Hot Pocket filled with a Hot Pocket. It tastes just like a Hot Pocket."
You get the idea.
"He's not off the wall," said Scott VanZandt of East Fishkill, who is also going to the early show. "He's very laid back. He's very self-deprecating. He talks about his laziness, his attraction to food. There's a lot of humor around his weight and his affinity toward food... Its real. It's situational. It's family. It's poking fun at yourself."
A four-time Grammy nominee, two-time New York Times best-selling author, Emmy winner and multi-platinum-selling recording artist, Gaffigan and his wife, Jeannie, live in Manhattan, "with their five loud and expensive children," according to his publicist.
His motion picture credits include two "Super Troopers" films and he is scheduled to appear in 10 new films in 2019.
In addition to two seasons of the semi-autobiographical "The Jim Gaffigan Show," which the comedian wrote and produced with his wife, Gaffigan has appeared in his own stand-up comedy specials. In 2015, he performed for Pope Francis in Philadelphia.
As for the manner in which Gaffigan makes people laugh, VanZandt said, "Everything you might think is wrong with a person, he take the approach that it's OK to be that way and he can find humor in it. I very much believe that those in the audience find truth in their own lives, that aligns with what he's saying."

Texto completo: Como de si de una telenovela se tratara, Emily Zamora está demandando al padre de su hijo, el magnate Mark Gorton, quien la abandonó al descubrir que había mentido sobre sus orígenes humildes.
Ahora Zamora está solicitando $37,500 dólares mensuales para la manutención de su hijo de 4 meses, incluyendo $9 mil para la niñera.
Gorton (52) es el creador del servicio de intercambio de música LimeWire y ha invertido millones de dólares en el grupo de ciclismo profesional Transportation Alternatives.
Los abogados de Zamora (23) dicen que su ex-amante millonario, que le dobla la edad y es educado en las prestigiosas universidades Harvard, Yale y Stanford, la abandonó después de enterarse de que proviene de una familia trabajadora.
“Emily es una niña joven e ingenua y estaba avergonzada de sus orígenes”, reconoció su abogado Raoul Felder a New York Post después de una comparecencia ayer ante el tribunal en Manhattan.
Allí Zamora exigió que los pagos de manutención infantil de Gorton se incrementaran de $6 mil a $37,500 dólares al mes.
Después de conocerse a través de un sitio de citas en línea, Zamora afirmó falsamente a Gorton que su madre había asistido a Harvard, pero en realidad es una cocinera en un restaurante italiano en Texas, mientras que su padre es un empleado de correos.
Gorton contrató a alguien para investigar a la joven y descubrió que le había mentido.
En la corte, los abogados de Gorton pintaron a Zamora como a una cazafortunas. Su abogado admitió que “es una mentirosa. No se trata de ser pobre. Es sólo que una mentirosa no llega a ser recompensada por las mentiras que dijo y exige millones de dólares en manutención infantil”, dijo Eric Wrubel al juez Michael Katz.
Mientras tanto, el juez regañó a Zamora por haber llevado al bebé de la pareja a la corte. “Estás utilizando al niño (…) En el futuro, no puedes traerlo para desfilar frente a la prensa”.
La joven madre afirmó que no había podido encontrar a nadie que vigilara al bebé.
Además de LimeWire, Gorton posee la firma de servicios financieros Tower Research Capital LLC. Y a “Transportation Alternatives” le ha regalado más de $10 millones de dólares desde 2002, según The New York Times.
Katz no emitió un fallo en el caso ayer y prometió hacerlo en una fecha posterior.

Texto completo: Unlike citizens of most every other nation, Americans are not required by law to carry identification when they are simply walking around. Just as there is no national religion, there is no official language here, and we are free to gab in any tongue we choose.
So what possessed a United States Customs and Border Protection officer who last spring stopped two American women in a small Montana city and asked for their identification because, he said, he heard them speaking Spanish?
Well, there’s an easy answer to that rhetorical question: It was the false color of law, the un-American pretense that a uniform creates the right to invade others’ privacy without probable cause, that led the officer to pretend he could ask for something he had no right to.
Because, plain and simple, there is no national ID card here, and there is no need to carry anything with you as you go about your daily business — or to show even a driver’s license to law enforcement if there is no real reason to do so. But the undeniable truth is that police officers around the country quite often act as if this is not the case. It simply makes life easier for them if they can figure out who you are and run your name through the system when they have any suspicions at all.
In some small way, the fact that we can stroll ID-free helps keep the fully bureaucratic state at bay.
And that’s why we are glad that the two women in Montana, Ana Suda and Martha Hernandez, are suing the government agency in a symbolically important case brought by the ACLU.
They were in a convenience store in Havre, Montana, on May 16, 2018 when, the lawsuit alleges, Agent Paul A. O’Neal commented on Hernandez’s accent, calling it “very strong.” He then asked where they were born. Hernandez was born in California and Suda in Texas.
When the women expressed shock at the agent’s question, The New York Times reports, he said he was “dead serious” and asked to see their identification.
The pair were in possession of their valid Montana driver’s licenses, and, probably smartly, deciding to produce them, maintain as we might that they didn’t have to.
The officer briefly detained them in the store’s parking lot, the suit alleges. The women filmed the encounter on their phones, and asked on camera why they were being stopped.
“Ma’am the reason I asked you for your ID is I came in here and I saw you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here,” the agent said. The town is 35 miles from the Canadian border.
The agency has lots of real work to do. Frivolous lawsuits would only make that harder. But this kind of fighting back against false authority is so very important for Americans to continue to do in an increasingly un-private age. It is not against the law to speak Spanish — or Klingon, for that matter.
Government intrusion on individual liberty, whatever its rationale or purported justification, must be kept within reasonable limits.
In a society that values liberty, it is untenable for government agents to use accents or choice of language as a starting point for infringing on individual liberty.

Texto completo: he third announced show in the 2019 Lowell Summer Music Series lineup features a trio of musicians who have come together to form an Americana supergroup.

I'm With Her -- featuring singer-songwriters and multi-instrumentalists Sara Watkins (formerly of Nickel Creek), Sarah Jarosz and Newton's own Aoife O'Donovan -- come to Boarding House Park on Friday, July 19 at 7:30 p.m.

Tickets are $37 in advance, $137 for premium seating right in front of the stage, and go on sale Tuesday, Feb. 19, at 10 a.m., at www.lowellsummermusic.org.

I'm With Her features three musicians who met each other individually, moved on to successful solo careers and then came together a few years ago.

Jarosz was 9 when she met Watkins, who is about a decade older, at a festival. O'Donovan, who is almost the same age as Watkins, began noticing Jarosz when the latter was 15, according to an article in The New York Times last November.

"You were this amazing young person," she said. "You just had so much confidence and skill, but you were never, like, 'Look at me, I'm so good and I'm so young, heh heh heh.' You always seemed like a peer."

The trio began collaborating at the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival, when they were asked to sing together at a workshop. They performed together for the first time at the January 2015 Celtic Connections festival in Scotland, and toured Europe. Later that year, they wrote songs together in Los Angeles and again in a separate writing session at a Vermont farmhouse.

They released singles in 2015 and 2017 before releasing their debut album, "See You Around," on Rounder Records last year. They earned a nomination for Duo/Group of the Year last year in the Americana Music Association Awards.

Watkins is no stranger to the area, having played a solo show at The Bull Run Restaurant in Shirley in 2016.

Resumen: Disney unveiled Will Smith's very blue Genie from 'Aladdin' at the Grammy Awards. Now that the howling has subsided, how bad is the situation?

Texto completo: If Walt Disney Studios and director Guy Ritchie were granted three wishes, one of them would surely be that Will Smith's Genie in the live-action "Aladdin" would find a little love.
So far, there's been overwhelming vocal consternation over the pivotal character in the remake that flies into theaters May 24.
It was always going to be a bumpy ride for anyone stepping into the curled genie shoes after Robin Williams voiced his iconic, exhilarating role in 1992's animated "Aladdin. "
Fans rejoiced when the Genie-less first teaser arrived last October. "I fangirled so hard . . . It looks so good!" one tweeted. "I'm legit over here sobbing," another wrote. But the very blue unveiling of Smith's Genie in a Grammy Awards telecast "special look" was skewered on social media.
The New York Times' Kyle Buchanan feverishly led the tweeted criticism, including, "They premiered this image at night??? We are supposed to sleep after this???"
We could go on about the chorus of social media barbs, which became such a thing that John Oliver used the blue Genie image as a punchline on "Last Week Tonight," comparing it to the looming "disaster" when Britain leaves the European Union.
"You know how Twitter is. There’s a pitchfork army out there and they all join in. And right now, Will Smith’s blue Genie is out in front of this army, in a negative way," says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. "The Genie just looked odd. And while it's called 'Aladdin,' all the attention since Robin Williams' role is focused on the Genie. "
First photo: The Internet is fixated on Will Smith's Genie, and not in a good way
The backlash: Twitter rips Will Smith's 'too blue' Genie after 'Aladdin' trailer airs
Disney wouldn't comment on the marketing aspects of the film, which has stoked excitement with fans who made 2016's live-action "The Jungle Book" a major hit. The studio stood behind its Genie in a statement to USA TODAY: “We have one of the most anticipated films of the year and are confident that audiences will fall in love with the Genie and all of the characters when it hits the big screen this May. ”
Bringing out the Will Smith Genie, and the blue, has been a slow, deliberate rollout for Disney after two teaser trailers – as if to ease fans into the full live-action blueness against the formidable history of Williams' cartoon creation.
In December, a smiling Smith was unveiled on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, minus his CGI blue coloring. After fans reacted badly, the star assured them on Instagram, "I’m gonna be BLUE! :-) This is how the Genie is in Human / Disguise Form. "
They didn't know how blue.
However awkward the first look, the negative reaction shouldn't be a surprise, according to director Raja Gosnell, who unveiled his own bright blue update of beloved animated characters in 2011's live-action "The Smurfs. "
"We didn’t have the Twitter world back then that we have now, thank God. But that unveiling was met with levels of horror and gnashing of teeth by the online community," says Gosnell. "There is always going to be some sort of outcry by the keyboard warriors. It was going to be the same thing with the blue Genie from 'Aladdin. ' "
"The Smurfs" went on to find its audience, make $563. 7 million in the worldwide box office, and Gosnell brought the live-action creations brought back for a 2013 sequel, "The Smurfs 2. "
But there are many voices who contend Disney missed the vital opportunity to make a strong first impression that Smith's Genie could hold his own against Williams' legacy.
Paul Michael Glaser conceptualized and directed 1996's "Kazaam" around 7-foot-1 superstar center Shaquille O'Neal. While the fantasy musical was disparaged by critics, visualizing Shaq as a genie was spot-on casting.
Glaser says the decision to depict Smith as blue and physically pumped up, like a live-action version of Williams' character, wasn't "a smart thing to do. "
"Making him blue was a bit of cop-out. But even more than that was the big, muscular look makes this Genie more comparable to the animated version. Why does a Genie have to be all of that?" says Glaser.
He would have preferred seeing more of what the superstar leading man could bring. "They missed the boat in terms of trying to really explore what it would be like to rub a bottle and have Will Smith come out of it," says Glaser.
Smith has made clear he will make the part his own in the final film, which EW described in the first look story as “part Fresh Prince, part Hitch. " Smith, who acknowledged he was "terrified" to go up against Williams' "iconic" role, said in the piece his character was "different enough and unique enough that it would be in a different lane. "
There's still time for the formidable Disney marketing machine, with the powers of charismatic PR power player Smith, to right the spilled bottle.
"Disney has its own magic lamps," says Bock. "And 'Aladdin' is fortunate to pretty much own Memorial Day weekend for family entertainment. So it's in good shape there. "
Part of the marketing blitz will include a full trailer, which still hasn't been released yet. Perri Nemiroff, senior producer of movie site Collider. com, suggests "scaling back on Genie in the marketing, that might be the smartest move after what we've seen. "
The emphasis could focus on other "Aladdin" aspects such as Mena Massoud as Aladdin, Naomi Scott as Jasmine and their adventure story.
Then Smith will have an entire movie to unfurl his full Genie.
"I just want to see Will Smith own that look and make that role his own," says Nemiroff. "I'm hoping my optimism will not be misplaced. "
Randall Jaynes, who has made a career as a deep-hued member of Blue Man Group and is now its artistic director, believes people will come to love this Genie and his vibrant coloring.
"You could already hear this Genie is Will Smith. It had his jingle and pizzazz, but the color is so evocative, it changed the look. Of course, people are going to get used to it," says Jaynes. "Welcome, Will Smith: Blue is a wonderful world to be in. "

Justices fortify rights to fight police seizures

Texto completo: The Supreme Court on Wednesday strengthened the rights of Americans to fight police seizures of vehicles and other property, ruling the 8th Amendment's ban on "excessive fines" applies to states and localities, not just the federal government.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in her second day back from cancer surgery, delivered the opinion for a unanimous court.
The ruling is a victory for Tyson Timbs, an Indiana man and a former heroin addict whose $42,000 Land Rover was seized by police after he was convicted of two drug sales that amounted to about $300.

Since the "war on drugs" of the 1980s, some law enforcement agencies have routinely used their so-called forfeiture power to seize vehicles, boats, homes and businesses that had been used in crimes, including drug trafficking. The Supreme Court has refused to halt these seizures.
But in Wednesday's ruling, the justices gave owners the right to challenge forfeitures that are "grossly disproportionate" to their crime.
The case of Timbs vs. Indiana also revisited a nearly forgotten era in constitutional law.
Before the mid-20th century, most parts of the Bill of Rights were seen as limiting only the federal government, not states. For example, the 1st Amendment begins by specifically barring "Congress" from making certain kinds of laws.
But in a series of rulings, the high court decided that rights such as freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, right to a jury trial and protection against cruel and unusual punishments were fundamental and therefore must be honored by states and localities as well as the federal government.
The court did so by saying these rights were included, or "incorporated," into the 14th Amendment, which applied to the states.
But none of those decisions dealt specifically with the 8th Amendment's ban on excessive fines.
When Timbs tried to challenge the seizure of his Land Rover as an excessive fine, he lost when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled the U.S. Constitution did not protect him against an excessive fine.
The libertarian Institute of Justice appealed his case to the high court. And there, he had the support of a broad ideological coalition including the American Civil Liberties Union and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
When the case was argued in November, the court's newest appointees, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, chided Indiana's state attorney for defending a hopelessly outdated view of the law.
"Here we are in 2018 still litigating incorporation of the Bill of Rights. Really?" Gorsuch said to Indiana state Solicitor Thomas Fisher.
"Isn't it just too late in the day to argue that any of the Bill of Rights is not incorporated?" Kavanaugh asked.
During her recovery in her Watergate apartment, Ginsburg reported that she was busy working on opinions.
And speaking in the courtroom Wednesday, she said the protection against unjust and excessive fines imposed by the government is a fundamental right and is not limited in its scope.
"The protection against excessive fines guards against abuses of government's punitive or criminal law enforcement authority. This safeguard, we hold, is 'fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,' with 'dee[p] root[s] in [our] history and tradition,'" she wrote. "The Excessive Fines Clause is therefore incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment."
The decision is not a final victory for Timbs. His case now goes back to Indiana, where he can argue that the seizure of his Land Rover was "grossly disproportionate" to his crime and is therefore unconstitutional.
As Ginsburg noted, Timbs was sentenced to one year of home detention for his drug crimes and was ordered to pay $1,203 in fees and court costs. The maximum fine under state law for his conviction was $10,000.
And for the second time this week, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion to fault the court for past rulings that he vehemently opposes.
In a concurring opinion Wednesday, he compared the Roe vs. Wade ruling on abortion to the Dred Scott decision that upheld slavery prior to the Civil War.
On the one hand, Thomas said he agreed excessive fines were unconstitutional, but he said he disagreed with the court's view that these rights are part of the "due process" of law protected under the 14th Amendment.
"And because the court's substantive due process precedents allow the court to fashion fundamental rights without any textual constraints, it is equally unsurprising that among these precedents are some of the court's most notoriously incorrect decisions. E.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393, 450 (1857)," he wrote.
Since shortly after joining the court in 1992, Thomas has called for overturning Roe vs. Wade.
In a separate opinion on Tuesday, he said the court should overturn the landmark 1964 decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan, which extended the "freedom of the press" to protect news organizations from state libel verdicts.

Texto completo: The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical is the electrifying musical adaption of the New York Times best-selling novel written by Rick Riordan. If you are not familiar with the book, Percy Jackson, a son of Poseidon, has newly discovered powers he can't control, monsters on his trail, and is on a quest to find Zeus' lightning bolt to prevent a war between the Greek gods. The show has a great message about what makes us different makes us stronger.
Jalynn Steele (Fosse, Mamma Mia!, Beehive) who plays Sally chopped it up with City. Life.Style, about the upcoming production:
City.Life.Style: This is an interesting musical, how does this differ from other productions you've performed in?
Jalynn Steele: It's different because this is the first musical I've been a part of that started as a book with a huge fan base and a magical fantasy storyline. Also, this is the first time I've had to do this much stage combat in a musical. Usually, it's singing, dancing and acting, I've never done this much fighting in my life. It's a challenge and a joy to do.
CLS: How do you prepare to play multiple roles?
Steele: My preparation is a process. Some of my characters are described briefly in the books and some have a little more description, I wanted to stay true to them but add a little bit of who I am as a performer. With each time I do the show, I learn and grow with each of these characters, making them more distinct and come to life in my world. Also, sometimes I think to myself "where was this person just coming from?" right before I go onstage.
CLS: What can the audience expect from this production?
Steele: The audience can expect a wonderful story, great performances, and amazing effects. And though it was a book first, you don't have to know anything about it to enjoy it. Its wonderful story is told and the music helps you understand just what's happening. It's fun for all ages and takes you on an amazing adventure from start to finish.
Tickets start at $49 and are now on sale. Tickets can be purchased online at www.broadwayindetroit.com or www.ticketmaster.com, and by phone at 800-982-2787.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is considering four people to be his next United Nations ambassador: Goldman Sachs Group partner Dina Powell; the current ambassadors to Canada and Germany, Kelly Craft and Richard Grenell, respectively; and John James, a former Republican Senate candidate from Michigan, according to people familiar with the matter.
The people asked not to be identified because Trump hasn't made a decision. Top White House aides have also discussed nominating Trump's daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump if no front-runner emerges.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert withdrew her nomination to replace Nikki Haley in the job, partly due to issues that arose around a nanny Nauert once employed. The nanny was a legal U.S. immigrant but wasn't authorized to work, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Powell is a veteran of the Trump administration who served as a deputy national security adviser before returning to Goldman Sachs last year. Craft was deeply involved in Trump's renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and is married to Joe Craft, a billionaire Republican fundraiser and executive at coal producer Alliance Resource Partners.
Grenell manages the U.S. relationship with the German government, which has grown tense because of a variety of conflicts, including the president's consideration of tariffs on imported cars.
James fell short in an attempt to unseat Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow last year.
No plan for Smollett to do follow-up police interview
CHICAGO - Attorneys for "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans Monday for him to meet with Chicago detectives for a follow-up interview that police have requested about his reported assault.
Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers. She said in an emailed statement that his lawyers "will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."
Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in "MAGA Country."
Police said Saturday that the investigation had "shifted" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.
Smollett's lawyers said the actor feels "victimized" by reports that he played a role in the assault.
New York City guidelines take aim at hairstyle discrimination
NEW YORK - New York City doesn't want people to have their hairstyles held against them, and it unveiled novel guidelines Monday against hairdo discrimination.
The new legal guidance says the city's existing human rights law protects New Yorkers' right to "maintain natural hair or hairstyles that are closely associated with their racial, ethnic or cultural identities."
The New York Times reported that they are believed to be the first such measure nationwide.
In effect, the guidance enables people to seek fines and other remedies if they've been harassed or punished in workplaces, schools or public spaces because of their hair texture or style. Hair nets, ties and the like can still be required for health and safety reasons.
Roger Stone posts photo of judge with cross-hairs symbol
NEW YORK - Roger Stone criticized the federal judge overseeing his criminal case on Monday, blasting her as a partisan appointee of President Barack Obama and posting a photo of her face featuring what appeared to be a cross-hairs symbol.
The embattled confidant to President Donald Trump posted the picture of Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Instagram but quickly deleted it after the New York Daily News asked him about the apparent rifle scope symbol in the left hand corner.
Stone, who was indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation last month, claimed he "didn't notice the symbol" on the photo that he said he got off the Internet.
Stone deleted the photo and replaced it with one cropping out the cross-hairs.
Mexico to close infamous island penal colony
MEXICO CITY - Mexico will close a famed island penal colony off the country's Pacific coast and convert it into a cultural and environmental education center, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Monday.
The federal prison on the largest of the Islas Marias will release about 200 of its approximately 600 inmates and the rest will be relocated to other prisons.
The prison founded in 1905 on Maria Madre passed through periods of infamous brutality. When Panama closed its Isla Coiba penal colony in 2004, Isla Marias was the last one remaining in the Americas.
He noted that the last riot there occurred in 2003 because it was over capacity. At that time there were 8,000 prisoners there, he said.
The island is about 70 miles off the coast of Nayarit state.
Oakland Diocese names 45 accused of sexual abuse
OAKLAND, Calif. - The Catholic Diocese of Oakland has released the names of 45 priests, deacons and religious brothers who officials say are "credibly accused" of sexually abusing minors.
The San Francisco Chronicle said Monday that Oakland's list goes back to 1962 - when the diocese was founded. None of the men are currently in the ministry. Of the 45 people named, 20 were priests.
Oakland is the latest in a series of dioceses across the country to release names amid a scandal involving pedophile priests and decades of church cover-ups.
Most of the listed abuse dates from the 1960s into the 1980s. Diocese officials say there have been no credible accusations of abuse since 1988, but acknowledge that the list may grow in the coming months.
In Bolivia: A passenger bus crashed head-on with a dump truck in southern Bolivia on Monday, killing at least 24 people and injuring 12 more, police said.
The accident occurred in a dense fog about 135 miles south of the capital, La Paz. Two buses collided on the same highway in January, killing 22 people.
In Britain: British border officials have picked up 34 people thought to be migrants who were trying to cross the English Channel in a small boat. The Home Office said their nationalities were unknown, but they were taken ashore for interviews Monday while three men were arrested for suspected immigration offenses.

A Priest With Progeny? Church Has Guidelines for That

Texto completo: ROME -- Vincent Doyle, a psychotherapist in Ireland, was 28 when he learned from his mother that the Roman Catholic priest he had always known as his godfather was in truth his biological father.
The discovery led him to create a global support group to help other children of priests, like him, suffering from the internalized shame that comes with being born from church scandal. When he pressed bishops to acknowledge these children, some church leaders told him that he was the product of the rarest of transgressions.
But one archbishop finally showed him what he was looking for: a document of Vatican guidelines for how to deal with priests who father children, proof that he was hardly alone.
"Oh my God. This is the answer," Mr. Doyle recalled having said as he held the document. He asked if he could have a copy, but the archbishop said no -- it was secret.
Now, the Vatican has confirmed, apparently for the first time, that its department overseeing the world's priests has general guidelines for what to do when clerics break celibacy vows and father children.
"I can confirm that these guidelines exist," the Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti wrote in response to a query from The New York Times. "It is an internal document."
The issue is becoming harder to ignore. "It's the next scandal," Mr. Doyle said. "There are kids everywhere."
As the Vatican prepares for an unprecedented meeting with the world's bishops this week on the devastating child sexual abuse crisis, many people who feel they have been wronged by the church's culture of secrecy and aversion to scandal will descend on Rome to press their cause.
There will be the victims of clerical child abuse. There will be nuns sexually assaulted by priests. And there will be children of priests, including Mr. Doyle, who is scheduled to meet privately in Rome with several prominent prelates.
For the church, stories like Mr. Doyle's draw uncomfortable attention to the violation of celibacy by priests and, for some former clerics and liberals inside the church, raise the issue of whether it is time to make the requirement optional, as it is in other Christian churches.
The children are sometimes the result of affairs involving priests and laywomen or nuns -- others of abuse or rape. There are some, exceedingly rare, high-profile cases, but the overwhelming majority remain out of the public eye.
The tradition of celibacy among Roman Catholic clergy was broadly codified in the 12th century, but not necessarily adhered to, even in the highest places. Rodrigo Borgia, while a priest, had four children with his mistress before he became Pope Alexander VI, an excess that helped spur Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation. Luther wrote mockingly that the pope had as much command over celibacy as "the natural movement of the bowels."
There are no estimates of how many such children exist. But Mr. Doyle said his support group website, Coping International, has 50,000 users in 175 countries.
He said he was first shown the Vatican guidelines in October 2017 by Archbishop Ivan Jurkovic, the Vatican's envoy to the United Nations in Geneva.
"You're actually called 'children of the ordained,"' Mr. Doyle recalled Archbishop Jurkovic having said. "I was shocked they had a term for it."
Archbishop Jurkovic declined a request for an interview.
Mr. Gisotti, the Vatican spokesman, said that the internal 2017 document synthesized a decade's worth of procedures, and that its "fundamental principle" was the "protection of the child." He said the guideline "requests" that the father leave the priesthood to "assume his responsibilities as a parent by devoting himself exclusively to the child."
But another Vatican official said that the "request" was a mere formality. Monsignor Andrea Ripa, the under secretary in the Congregation for the Clergy, which oversees more than 400,000 priests, said in a brief interview that "it is impossible to impose" the dismissal of the priest, and that it "can only be asked" for by the priest.
But he added that the failure to ask to be relieved of priestly obligations was reason for the church to take action: "If you don't ask, you will be dismissed."
The Irish bishops have their own guidelines, and made them public in 2017. Mr. Doyle, who once studied for the priesthood and has sought to cooperate with church leaders, played a role in developing them, said Martin Long, a spokesman for the Irish Bishops' Conference.
The Irish church's principles do not explicitly require clerics to leave the priesthood but state: "A priest as any new father, should face up to his responsibilities -- personal, legal, moral and financial."
Pope Francis' remarks on the issue are limited. In his 2010 book, "On Heaven and Earth," which he co-wrote when he was the archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis argues that a priest who in a moment of passion violates a vow of celibacy could potentially stay in the ministry, but one who fathers a child could not.
"Natural law comes before his right as a priest," he writes, adding that a priest's first responsibility would be to his child, and that "he must leave his priestly ministry and take care of his child."
Canon lawyers say that there is nothing in church law that forces priests to leave the priesthood for fathering children. "There is zero, zero, zero," on the matter, said Laura Sgro, a canon lawyer in Rome. "As it is not a canonical crime, there are no grounds for dismissal."
Mr. Doyle, along with some other children of priests and some former priests themselves, say they do not believe that dismissal from the priesthood is always in the child's best interests, and that sometimes it potentially deprives a family of a livelihood.
"I don't believe unemployment is a response to paternity," Mr. Doyle said.
Some children of priests, however, wish their fathers were forced out of the ministry.
Rev. Pietro Tosi was 54 when he raped Erik Zattoni's mother, who was 14, Mr. Zattoni said. Her family tried to force the priest to recognize their son, but he refused. The family was evicted from their parish-owned home in a tiny town outside Ferrara, Italy, where they often bumped into each other.
"He never said anything," said Mr. Zattoni, now 37.
In 2010, Mr. Zattoni sued Father Tosi, demanding to be recognized. A court-ordered DNA test demonstrated that he was in fact the priest's son. The Vatican eventually instructed Father Tosi's bishop to admonish him and remind him of his responsibilities as a father, but did not demand his removal from the priesthood.
After a national news program highlighted his case, hundreds of Italians filled a Ferrara piazza in 2013 to show support for Mr. Zattoni and press Francis to take up his case.
Father Tosi died in 2014, still a priest.
"The justice I got," Mr. Zattoni said, "came through a court sentence based on DNA."
The children of priests are increasingly turning to DNA tests to prove that their parents are either priests or nuns.
"It's a breakthrough, and anybody can do it," said Linda Lawless, 56, an amateur genealogist in Australia, and herself the daughter of a priest, who has helped members of Coping International.
Her mother kept her paternity secret, but Ms. Lawless remembered noticing as a child that her mother was "absolutely terrified" whenever priests visited the house. Last year, she used a DNA test and the increasingly comprehensive databases and family trees of the genealogical website Ancestry.com to confirm that her biological father was a priest.
"That's when the secret came out," she said.

Welcome to Crossing the Border, a new limited-run weekly newsletter from The New York Times. Like what you see? Send this newsletter to a friend. If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.
Crossing the border can be done in a rental car, inching northward from, say, the tumult of Tijuana. It can be done on foot, over the walkway that runs in a southern direction from Laredo, Tex., to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. I spent four years as a reporter based in Mexico and two in Arizona, and I've stood on stretches of the border with one boot in one country and the companion in the other.
With the border so much in the news these days, and with New York Times correspondents spending so much of their time crisscrossing back and forth, we figured we'd offer readers the chance to spend some time there, too.
Follow along and you'll get a more nuanced sense of the long line between Mexico and the United States. It's neither as terrifying nor as trouble free as it's portrayed.
-- MARC LACEY, National editor
Heading to Mexico in a hurry
There are no one-way signs at the border. Surging north are migrants, truck drivers, shoppers, smugglers and numerous others. Going the other way last week were two men in an old tan pickup truck.
Following in a long tradition of Americans heading to Mexico in a hurry, the men, driving south out of Nogales, Ariz., made a swift and sudden run across the border. A Customs and Border Protection agent opened fire. The truck roared about 20 feet into Mexico and plowed into a concrete barrier.
"He's alive, he's alive!" somebody screamed as Mexican police officers rushed forward.
A few yards away, a tamale vendor named Francisco said he was pretty sure that the driver had tried to run over one of the agents. Then "they shot him in the head," said Francisco, who is known by other vendors as "El Toro," but declined to give his last name.
The U.S. authorities did not give a detailed account of the shooting, but the Mexican police told the newspaper Nogales International that the driver had indeed been shot in the head.
A mistaken step on the accelerator? Or a 21st-century outlaw, the latest in a long line of Americans who have found what seemed to be a good reason to head for Mexico?
So far, the authorities aren't saying. Customs and Border Protection agents said investigators with the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility and others were examining the shooting, which left the 21-year-old driver, still officially unidentified, in critical condition. After being taken to a hospital in the Mexican town of Nogales, the agency said, he was transferred to a facility in Southern Arizona for advanced medical care. The passenger was released after questioning by the Mexican authorities.
"No further details are expected to be immediately released," C.B.P. said in a statement.
We asked the nurses who the injured driver was and what happened to him. "No comment," they said. We asked the local sheriff what he knew. "Nothing," he replied.
Like so much these days at the border, which is often seen as a bright line between Mexico and the United States, exactly what took place is blurry.
-- JOSE A. DEL REAL, reporting from Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales, Mexico
Jose is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently deployed along the border. Each week they'll be sharing a slice of their reporting about the border and the people who spend time on both sides of it .

Number of the week: 4
That's how many times the president has visited the border region since taking office in 2017.
Monday's rally in El Paso, Tex., was the president's second visit this year, after a trip to McAllen, Tex., in January. Mr. Trump also visited the border in March 2018, when he inspected prototypes for a border wall in San Diego. In August 2017, he visited a border post in Yuma, Ariz.
This year's visits, coming amid a congressional showdown over the border wall, were meant to help the president shore up support for what he has called a "crisis" of illegal immigration. Both times -- here in McAllen and here in El Paso -- local residents complained that the president misstated the level of crime in their towns.
Learn more about: the wall
This week, as the country inched closer to a Friday deadline to avert another government shutdown, congressional leaders announced a possible compromise to avoid it. On Thursday, the House and the Senate passed legislation to fund the government, and on Friday, the president announced he would declare a national emergency in order to build the wall.
Here are five great ways to dive into the debate:
"In pursuit of a wall, President Trump ran into one." This analysis of the expected deal lays out how the president came to accept a defeat, over the objections of some of his supporters.
There are nearly 2,000 miles of border between the United States and Mexico. Here's a look at the barriers that already exist, including 700 miles of fencing built by the United States government since 2006.
Representative Will Hurd of Texas is the only Republican congressman who represents a border district. On a recent episode of The Daily, he spoke about why he disagrees with the president about a border wall. Listen to it here.
When Mr. Trump visited El Paso this week to make a pitch for the border wall, he repeated some frequent false claims about immigration. The Times fact-checked his speech here.
People in El Paso told us what they thought about the president's view of their city.

Texto completo: We crave a lot of things.
Food, if we're hungry. Safety, if we're scared. Normality, if we're a little different. Love, always.
So which is it, Christine O'Brien?
"All of the above," O'Brien said simply, with a wry grin.
The Walnut Creek author's newly published "Crave: A Memoir of Food and Longing" (St. Martin's Press, $28.99, 260 pages) details in poignant prose a childhood both shuttered from normality, yet in the spotlight. She grew up in New York City's most iconic celebrity-laden apartment building, the Dakota, on Central Park West. Her famous neighbors included Leonard Bernstein and Lauren Bacall, who gave out Tootsie-Pops at Halloween.
O'Brien's father was Ed Scherick, a producer of television (including "Bewitched," "Batman" and "That Girl") and films such as "The Stepford Wives" and "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three." Her mother, Carol, was a former beauty queen from Illinois. Parties at her home included guests such as Alan Alda and Marlo Thomas.
"But my parents were isolationists," O'Brien said. "I only remember them throwing two parties while we lived at the Dakota. My dad schmoozed and my mom felt uncomfortable."
As a child, she had lots of fears; New York in the '70s was scarier than it is now.
"Muggings right and left. You never just walked down the street," O'Brien said.
One of her fears was connected with the smell of Joy perfume, Carol's "going out" perfume; it meant her mom was leaving her, going out into the frightening city. Carol was a nervous mother, constantly hovering, warning them of everything such as small waves lapping at the shore when O'Brien's father fished, because you never know.
After Carol collapsed in their apartment one day and spent the next year in bed despite there being no physical illness, she began a regime of bizarre diets, such as raw liver, raw eggs, fresh yeast and at one point, coffee enemas. Then she forced the family to adhere to "The Program," which was mostly celery juice and blended salads. Boxes of vegetables crowded the kitchen counters and her mother spent most of everyday mixing up her concoctions. Her father raged. O'Brien and her three younger brothers cowered.
But they stuck with the program out of loyalty to their mother, who at times demanded they do water fasts in the summer, when they stayed in bed for five days at a time.
"It was like solitary confinement," O'Brien said. "But once you're released from all those food sensitivities, you'd get into this high. So after that, I was always looking for that high."
There was a high when she was 16, and the family took a house in Point Lookout on Barrier Island, New York. Boys noticed her for the first time, and she found a true girlfriend. But after she finished writing "Crave," O'Brien found diaries written during that time, expressing her hunger, her shame at being different, her parents being elitist and not mingling with the other summer families.
"My next memoir will cover just that summer," O'Brien said.
Will it be called "Shame?" She grins.
"No, but maybe it should be," she said.
The family eventually moved to Los Angeles, and her parents divorced. O'Brien went to UC Berkeley, met her husband, Tim, and started eating steak, which sent her into a guilt spiral.
"I always believed what my mother was doing with The Program was right which was hard, because I believed I wasn't pure if I craved steak," she said. "I still believe she was right, she was just 30 years ahead of her time. And the thing she didn't understand was no one diet fits all. She was unhealthy because she was so rigid. I don't think you can be healthy if your mind is always looking for the way everyone else is wrong."
O'Brien still adheres to a version of The Program. Meals are vegetable-heavy, with blended salad drinks that are way easier to make nowadays. She still craves steak and chocolate. "I have to have chocolate with me all the time," she said, rummaging in her purse and bringing out a plastic bag with the remnants of bars of dark chocolate with raspberries and offering some.
O'Brien raised her two children, now in their 20s, to have a healthy relationship with food, but it wasn't easy at first. "It was hard for me to watch them eat meat at first. I felt like I was ruining their innocence."
Now a part-time instructor in English composition at St. Mary's College, O'Brien is now riding a high that comes from relief that the book has been so well-received. The New York Times reported she presents her parents with "loving generosity." She's been compared to memoirist Mary Karr ("Liar's Club"), and her father's still living contemporaries have told her he'd be proud. She feels her mom's spirit is still with her, encouraging her, and describes what she thinks is a little sign of it she encountered while she was feeling most vulnerable while writing the book. "Look," she says, pointing to a photo on her cell phone. "This is the tree outside my bedroom window. I woke up one morning, and this was the last leaf on it." The remaining leaf was a large, perfect, blood-red heart.
"It's her saying It's all right. I love you," O'Brien said.

HSAs are a triple tax break that can help fast track retirement savings

Texto completo: Are you among the millions missing out on one of health care’s best financial fixes?
Health savings accounts (HSAs) let folks save tax-free for medical needs. If you have a high-deductible health insurance plan (over $1,350 for individuals or $2,700 for families), you’re eligible. Harness HSAs to help fast track your retirement.
They have three great features: Contributions are tax deferred and you can invest the funds; their growth isn’t taxed; withdrawals used for qualified medical expenses aren’t taxed either. A triple tax break! Huge.
Some confuse HSAs with flexible spending accounts (FSAs), which are also tax-free and cover costs like copayments and prescription drugs. But FSAs are more restricted. The most crucial limitation is FSA contributions are typically use-it-or-lose-it. If you don’t use them within the plan year (plus a short grace period, perhaps), they expire.
HSAs are simpler and more flexible. And, critically important, they aren’t use-it-or-lose-it. That means growth can compound over time.
“Longer-term advantages, after the age of 65, may include the payment of Medicare premiums and other long-term care expenses," explains David Musto, president of Ascensus, a financial services firm that focuses on retirement, education and health care. "The HSA becomes an important aspect of both solving near-term medical expenses, but also for larger expenses well into retirement with those accumulated earnings. ”
As Musto explains, “HSAs are under your control. You decide when and how the dollars are taken from the HSA. In 2017, 87 percent of HSA distributions were completed using the associated debit card versus needing any sort of employer administrative approval. ”
By determining when to use the funds, or not, you allow them to grow tax-free. That’s what spikes HSAs’ value to you later on in life. Even if you have big 401(k) savings, withdrawals are taxable unless you have a Roth plan. Paying Medicare premiums and other expenses with tax-free HSA money gives you much more flexibility.
Is Philadelphia for cash lovers? For retailers who say "no cash,'' Philadelphia says no dice: bill bans cards only
Job loss doesn't have to be a nightmare: Losing a job in your 50s is especially tough. Here are 3 steps to take when layoffs happen
Even before retirement, HSAs are super handy. Unexpected medical needs can happen any time. Many folks aren’t ready. One survey found 46 percent of consumers wouldn’t be able to pay an unexpected $1,000 medical bill within 30 days. The average bill for an emergency room visit is nearly double that, $1,917. These events can quickly derail your budget, especially if you have a high-deductible plan. Tax-free savings won’t heal you if you lop off your finger tip with a power saw (which I did 50 years ago), but they will make it easier to endure.
HSAs make retirement easier – and cheaper – too. Health care expenses dominate many retirees’ budgets. Having an HSA means a tax-free lifeline to cover nursing home stays, prescription drugs, medical supplies and so much more. This is a key reason many employers offer them: to complement retirement plans, including 401(k)s. Even if you have an easy time paying for medical needs today and have a comfortable buffer for unexpected expenses, saving in an HSA for the future is important.
What's the future for the middle class? Can the middle-class revival under Trump last?
While 81 percent of eligible employees have enrolled in an HSA, about 61 percent of Americans aren’t yet eligible. If that includes you, ask your employer to consider offering one during their next benefits review. The added savings power gives you greater confidence during health emergencies while helping you save for later retirement medical needs.

McCabe clarifies role in 25th Amendment talk in '60 Minutes' interview

Texto completo: He did not take part in 'extended discussions' on using it with Trump, spokeswoman says
Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, in a "60 Minutes" interview set to air Sunday night, said that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein broached using the 25th Amendment to oust President Trump in a wide-ranging discussion that suggested he was concerned about Trump's "capacity," according to a transcript released Friday.
McCabe said Rosenstein "raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort," adding that Rosenstein was "definitely very concerned about the president, about his capacity and about his intent at that point in time," according to the transcript.
"Rosenstein was actually openly talking about whether there was a majority of the cabinet who would vote to remove the president?" CBS News journalist Scott Pelley asked, according to the transcript.
"That's correct. Counting votes or possible votes," McCabe responded.
The 25th Amendment spells out a process for the president's Cabinet to force his removal from office if he is unable to perform his duties.
CBS released the transcript after a spokeswoman for McCabe sought to downplay the idea that McCabe knew of a substantive effort to oust Trump using the 25th Amendment, saying in a statement that he never participated in "any extended discussions" about the matter, nor was he aware of such talks.
According to the transcript, McCabe told Pelley he did not remember how Rosenstein brought up the idea. "It was just another kinda topic that he jumped to in the midst of-- of-- of a wide-ranging conversation," McCabe said.
Melissa Schwartz, McCabe's spokeswoman, said in the statement that McCabe only "was present and participated in a discussion that included a comment by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein regarding the 25th Amendment."
"To clarify, at no time did Mr. McCabe participate in any extended discussions about the use of the 25th Amendment, nor is he aware of any such discussions," Schwartz said.
Schwartz's statement came after CBS on Thursday offered a preview of Pelley's interview with McCabe. The preview did not show any of McCabe's own words, but Pelley said the former acting FBI director told him using the 25th Amendment was discussed and that officials were "counting noses" - or speculating on who might support such an endeavor.
"I just want to put a finer point on that, because there has been reporting, but I don't believe there has been a source that went on the record to confirm that the 25th Amendment was discussed about removing the president. So McCabe is saying that that was discussed?" CBS's Norah O'Donnell asked Pelley.
"Absolutely," Pelley responded. "McCabe, Norah, as you point out, is the very first person involved in these meetings who has come out and spoken publicly."
"But there was a discussion, underway, about removing the president of the United States?" O'Donnell followed up.
"They were counting noses," Pelley said. "They were not asking Cabinet members whether they would vote for or against removing the president, but they were speculating, 'This person would be with us. That person would not be.' And they were counting noses in that effort."
The New York Times first reported last year that McCabe alleged in memos that Rosenstein had talked about using the 25th Amendment to oust Trump - or wearing a wire to surreptitiously monitor the president - in the hectic days in May 2017 after Trump fired James B. Comey as FBI director. At the time, Rosenstein disputed the reporting.
The issue caused significant consternation at the White House and the Justice Department, and nearly led to Rosenstein leaving his job. When CBS previewed its McCabe interview Thursday, old tensions were reignited. The Justice Department again disputed McCabe's allegations, saying, "As the Deputy Attorney General previously has stated, based on his personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment, nor was the DAG in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment."
The president and his defenders seized on the notion that there was a sinister plot afoot among law enforcement to oust the elected commander in chief.
" 'Trying to use the 25th Amendment to try and circumvent the Election is a despicable act of unconstitutional power grabbing . . . which happens in third world countries. You have to obey the law. This is an attack on our system & Constitution,' " the president wrote on Twitter on Thursday , apparently quoting lawyer Alan Dershowitz from an appearance on Fox News.
McCabe in the coming week is scheduled to sit for interviews to promote his upcoming book, "The Threat," and it is likely that he will be asked more about his interactions with Rosenstein. Schwartz said in the statement that his book does not contain the anecdote about Rosenstein talking about the 25th Amendment and that McCabe "has merely confirmed a discussion that was initially reported elsewhere."

Women on Money &amp; Mindset: Who’s in your personal brain trust?

Texto completo: The term “brain trust” is a term that was used by James Kieran, a New York Times reporter, to describe the group of leaders assembled by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his presidential administration. President Roosevelt brought these “brains” together to advise him, decode problems and design new solutions for America.
When you think about it, having your own personal brain trust is a wise thing, no matter what our title or position. Life is complex, and those with whom we surround ourselves can make a difference in the way we look at life, contribute and enjoy the ride.
Who’s in your brain trust? And can the people in it support and challenge you in the following five ways?
Perspective
Living in the 21st century requires complex decision-making, being able to see and understand a problem or challenge from all angles.
Albert Einstein told us that we can’t solve problems with the same mindset that created them. However, it’s often difficult to step outside oneself to see other angles. Having a brain trust made up of people who come from various industries and backgrounds means you can tap into a vast pool of experience for greater perspective and creative solutions.
President Roosevelt’s brain trust helped him enact 19 laws to meet America’s challenges in just his first 100 days in office. He freely admitted this was due to having an intellectual powerhouse to bring ideas and perspective that he could not bring to the table alone.
Powerful support
It can get lonely as you carry out big responsibilities. Carrying this alone can cause isolation and stress. Unburdening and processing with family members or coworkers often creates greater stress on these relationships and can’t always provide the kind of support you need to meet life and work demands effectively.
It’s important for you to create a safe and powerful support system that is trustworthy, confidential and helpful in processing the complexity of your challenges.
Challenge
If you want to continue to grow so you lead both your life and work solidly into the future, you need input. What are you not seeing that you need to examine? How is not leading at a higher level affecting your life and work?
With great responsibilities, you can operate from “stress mode” as you address the immediate and urgent. This can develop tunnel vision and you will lean on familiar approaches that cannot meet more complex problems. This dynamic will prevent you from solving these problems, and meeting the important goals that will truly make a difference for you and the others around you.
A brain trust will challenge you where you might be playing small with limited thinking or approaches. It will provide that safe space for you to confront where you are holding yourself back and decide how you want to move forward.
Accountability
Change is hard. Growth is hard. Without an accountability mechanism, the biggest goals and commitments are seldom met successfully. As you process and make the necessary decisions to move forward, a brain trust will keep you accountable to yourself and your personal and professional commitments.
And because a brain trust’s only agenda is your agenda, you can count on your brain trust as an unbiased and supportive group that has your best interests in mind. This will help you to stay on track and to focus where you need in order to meet goals.
Community
How edifying and uplifting is your community? If you are like most, you have little time to enjoy the nurturing benefits of connection and community. In fact, your responsibilities and pace can limit your ability to form a meaningful community and to enjoy the gifts and benefits of bonds and belonging.
Your community can feel fragmented and might be made up solely of some of these:
* frantic seasonal socializing to reconnect with old friends during holidays
* etworking and brainstorming with peers
* industry- or business-specific meetings with colleagues
* connections with families of your kids and grandkids during sports season
* a weekly (if even that!) church experience
An intentionally focused community that encourages intellectual improvement, supports personal and professional growth, and genuinely cares about you is invaluable and rejuvenating. What’s more, being able to connect with this kind of community in a time of crisis or celebration is priceless.
How effective is your own brain trust? Here’s to taking charge to make yours exceptional, so that you can enjoy a more meaningful and rewarding journey in your life and work.

And because a brain trust’s only agenda is your agenda, you can count on your brain trust as an unbiased and supportive group that has your best interests in mind. This will help you to stay on track and to focus where you need in order to meet goals.
Community
How edifying and uplifting is your community? If you are like most, you have little time to enjoy the nurturing benefits of connection and community. In fact, your responsibilities and pace can limit your ability to form a meaningful community and to enjoy the gifts and benefits of bonds and belonging.
Your community can feel fragmented and might be made up solely of some of these:
* frantic seasonal socializing to reconnect with old friends during holidays
* etworking and brainstorming with peers
* industry- or business-specific meetings with colleagues
* connections with families of your kids and grandkids during sports season
* a weekly (if even that!) church experience
An intentionally focused community that encourages intellectual improvement, supports personal and professional growth, and genuinely cares about you is invaluable and rejuvenating. What’s more, being able to connect with this kind of community in a time of crisis or celebration is priceless.
How effective is your own brain trust? Here’s to taking charge to make yours exceptional, so that you can enjoy a more meaningful and rewarding journey in your life and work.

Texto completo: Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
President Donald Trump likes to say that he hires only the best people and that his White House operates like a well-oiled machine.
But a steady stream of insider accounts flowing out of the West Wing suggests that there's more madness than method to this administration.
The most recent entries are two books that just hit best-seller lists, one by former White House aide Cliff Sims, the other by ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a onetime Trump adviser.
Sims dishes about Oval Office back-stabbing in his explicitly titled "Team of Vipers." Christie's "Let Me Finish" laments Trump's choice of "amateurs, grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons ... hustled into jobs they were never suited for."
The authors join a pantheon of disgruntled leakers or tattling ex-staffers telling tales of incompetence at the highest executive levels. Last week, someone handed Axios three months of Trump's daily schedule, revealing in mortifying detail how the president spends more than half of his workday in vague "executive time" activities.
The consistent, mounting evidence of internal dysfunction is growing increasingly difficult to ignore or to explain away. Remember, these accounts aren't coming from Democrats or anti-Trump pundits:
A senior Trump administration official, writing an anonymous column in The New York Times, characterized the president as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," with decisions that are "half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless."
Bob Woodward, in his best-selling book "Fear," diagnosed a White House suffering a "nervous breakdown," with aides stealing papers off Trump's desk to deter bad policy. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly was quoted as saying: "We're in Crazytown."
"Fire and Fury" by Michael Wolff and "Unhinged" by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the ex-White House aide and former reality TV star, questioned the president's mental well-being.
Sprinkled throughout these tell-all tomes are unflattering assessments by top aides. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to Woodward, said Trump comprehends like a "fifth- or sixth-grader." And former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has never denied reports that he labeled Trump a "moron."
Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
With more books in the pipeline, the Trump campaign is eager to try to enforce nondisclosure agreements signed by ex-staffers. What doesn't the White House want the public to know?
Trump administration insiders keep trying to warn the world that something is terribly awry. Americans ignore them at their peril.

Texto completo: Rocker Ryan Adams' immediate response to The New York Times reporting on his allegedly abusive relationships with multiple women was to say he was "taking you down" with a lawsuit -- which he quickly deleted and replaced with a more temperate series of tweets.
"I know you got lawyers," he wrote before the piece was published. "But do you have the truth on your side. No. I do. Run your smear piece. But the legal eagles see you. Rats." That tweet quickly was taken down, as the gravity of his position seemed to kick in.
"I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes," he wrote in the first of three new tweets after the Times' story appeared. "To anyone I have ever hurt, I apologize deeply. But the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage. As someone who has always tried to spread joy through my music and my life, hearing that some people believe I caused them pain saddens me greatly," he wrote in the final tweet for the time being.
Adams was responding to a detailed New York Times piece that alleged that Adams' manipulative relationships with women were laid out by seven women and more than a dozen associates in their reporting.

What People Are Saying About the Breakup

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
The news on Thursday that Amazon had decided not to build a second headquarters in New York City was an equal-opportunity stunner, to the politicians and activists who had fought against it, and to the business leaders and elected officials who had eagerly awaited it.
Within minutes of the company's announcement, reactions spilled out on social media and in the streets of Long Island City, Queens, the site of the now-abandoned plans for expansion.
Amazon
The company released a long statement on its blog at noon, a few minutes after The New York Times broke the story.
"After much thought and deliberation, we've decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for Amazon in Long Island City, Queens," the statement said. "For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term."
It continued: "A number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned."
Read the full statement.
Mayor Bill de Blasio
Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo were the deal's strongest proponents, having negotiated it together and presented it as a major triumph. For opponents of the plan, the mayor's efforts suggested that he was not the progressive he had always claimed to be. His statement seemed aimed at walking back his support.
"We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world. Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity," Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.
"If Amazon can't recognize what that's worth, its competitors will."
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo
Mr. Cuomo had spent much of the previous week attacking State Senate Democrats for their opposition to the deal, even though the ruling conference was not unanimous in its stance.
On Thursday, he doubled down on that blame.
"A small group politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community -- which poll after poll showed overwhelmingly supported bringing Amazon to Long Island City -- the state's economic future and the best interests of the people of this state," he said in a statement.
"The New York State Senate has done tremendous damage. They should be held accountable for this lost economic opportunity."
State Senator Michael Gianaris
Mr. Gianaris, of Queens, was one of the loudest opponents of the deal, which would have brought Amazon to his district. Earlier this month, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the leader of the Senate Democratic majority, recommended Mr. Gianaris to sit on a little-known state board that could have granted him veto power over the plan.
Mr. Gianaris was triumphant on Thursday. He cited Amazon's statement that it would still expand in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island.
"Even by their own words, Amazon admits they will grow their presence in New York without their promised subsidies," he said in an interview. "So, what was all this really about?"
Ms. Stewart-Cousins said Amazon officials told her that her recommendation of Mr. Gianaris was not the tipping point in their decision. She criticized the secret negotiations that had created the deal to begin with.
"In speaking to Amazon, they don't lay the blame on any single entity. They realize that there was political opposition on every front," she said in an interview. "And that is because this is a flawed process. The process should not get two years down the road, practically, before you actually bring in the community."
City Council Speaker Corey Johnson
Mr. Johnson had applauded Mr. Gianaris's efforts to block Amazon, and he affirmed his criticisms of the company on Thursday.
"I hope this is the start of a conversation about vulture capitalism and where our tax dollars are best spent," he said in a statement.
Unions
Opponents to the deal constantly pointed to Amazon's anti-union reputation. Amazon officials said at a recent hearing that they would not remain neutral if their employees tried to unionize.
But the city's unions were divided on the deal, and their reaction to its collapse was equally split.
The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which had vehemently opposed the deal -- Amazon presents a direct threat to retail workers -- said the company had taken an unacceptable, uncompromising approach.
"Rather than addressing the legitimate concerns that have been raised by many New Yorkers, Amazon says you do it our way or not at all, we will not even consider the concerns of New Yorkers," Chelsea Connor, a spokeswoman for the union, said.
But Hector Figueroa, the president of the 32BJ Service Employees International Union, called the deal's demise "a lost opportunity" for labor to "actually organize and improve working conditions at Amazon."
Mr. Figueroa's union represents workers, including office cleaners and security officers, who would have benefited from the influx of jobs.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the superstar first-year congresswoman who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, was one of the first politicians to attack the deal.
"Anything is possible," she wrote on Twitter on Thursday. "Today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world."
Gianna Cerbone
Owner of Manducatis Rustica, a restaurant in Long Island City
Ms. Cerbone strongly supported having Amazon come to the neighborhood.
"I'm really upset, because I don't think they realized what they did," she said of the politicians who opposed the deal. "And they're proud of it? They think they did something lovely? They wanted the political gain, they should have done it in a different way. They get put into office for us, not to work for themselves."
Referring to a local public housing complex, she said: "I know people who live in Queensbridge. I know the people who actually needed these jobs. And I know the businesses who are going to suffer because of this."
Business and tech communities
Kathryn Wylde, the head of the Partnership for New York City, a powerful business association, said the city should have seen the company's exit coming.
"How can anyone be surprised?" she said. "We competed successfully, made a deal and spent the last three months trashing our new partner."
The reception Amazon received, she added, sent a "pretty bad message to the job creators of the city and the world."
Thomas J. Grech, the president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, said that no words could convey "the sadness and dismay at the loss of this historic opportunity."
He added: "An entire generation will look back at the these last few months and ask us why. I hope those that opposed this Amazon deal have the answers to what we lost today."
Julie Samuels, the executive director of Tech:NYC, a coalition of technology companies that includes Facebook and Google, said Amazon's decision could hurt New York's ability to attract talent in the field.
"New York City is today one of the most dynamic tech hubs in the world, but there is no guarantee we will maintain this status in the future," she said in a statement.
Senator Elizabeth Warren
Ms. Warren, a presidential candidate from Massachusetts who has made fighting income inequality and corporate influence a central plank of her campaign, wrote on Twitter that giant corporations were holding democracy "hostage."
"Amazon -- one of the wealthiest companies on the planet -- just walked away from billions in taxpayer bribes, all because some elected officials in New York aren't sucking up to them enough," she said.
Progressive activists
Grass-roots groups had rallied against the deal since it was announced. They spent last weekend canvassing to build opposition.
New York City's chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America said its members had been part of an "unprecedented mobilization" against a company that wanted to "crack down on unions and workers' rights, increase deportations of our immigrant neighbors, and fuel gentrification and rising rents."
Make the Road New York, an immigrants' rights group, said the decision was proof that "people power wins, even against the world's richest man," referring to Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos.
CAAAV Organizing Asian Communities was blunt about the Valentine's Day breakup.
"It's not us, Amazon," the group wrote on Twitter. "It's you."
Patrick McGeehan, Willie Neuman, Corey Kilgannon and Jesse McKinley contributed reporting.

A Facebook Settlement With the F.T.C. Could Run Into the Billions

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission are discussing a settlement over privacy violations that could amount to a record, multibillion-dollar fine, according to three people with knowledge of the talks.
The company and the F.T.C.'s consumer protection and enforcement staff have been in negotiations over a financial penalty for claims that Facebook violated a 2011 privacy consent decree with the agency, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is private.
In 2011, Facebook promised a series of measures to protect user privacy after an investigation found it had harmed consumers with its handling of user data.
The current talks have not yet reached the F.T.C.'s five commissioners for a vote and it is unclear how close the two sides are to wrapping up the nearly 11-month investigation. The commissioners met in mid-December and were updated by staff members that they had at that point found considerable evidence of violations of the 2011 consent decree.
The F.T.C. began its investigation into Facebook's mishandling of data after The New York Times reported in March 2018 that the information of 87 million users had been harvested by a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, without their permission.
Facebook confirmed the negotiations with the F.T.C., which could still break down and lead to litigation. The discussions were first reported by The Washington Post.
Facebook's 2011 consent decree requires the company to seek permission from users for plans to share their data with third parties. The trade commission also requires Facebook to notify it when third parties misuse this data.
Some F.T.C. officials have pressed for maximum penalties because of several new reports of potential privacy breaches since the start of the investigation. The agency can seek up to $41,000 for each violation found by the agency. In the case of Cambridge Analytica, 87 million people were affected.
The highest financial penalty imposed by the F.T.C. so far was a $22.5 million fine on Google for violating an agreement to protect consumer data.
Continued news reports of data violations, including a Times report about data sharing between Facebook and partner tech companies in December, have raised concerns among F.T.C. officials of setting the fine too low, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
The agency is under pressure to show teeth in its Facebook investigation, and the company's missteps over the past two years have made it a target for lawmakers. Members of Congress have complained that the F.T.C. is lagging behind European regulators that have taken a tougher stand with internet companies.

Texto completo: (TriceEdneyWire.com)-Women, especially women of color and poor women, tend to suffer disproportionately in our health care system. The problem is growing worse now that there's a group of trial lawyers eager to exploit female victims, under the guise of offering help.
Take for instance that roughly one-quarter of U.S. women suffer from pelvic floor disorders, and according to The Washington Post, about 3-4 million of them have been treated with transvaginal mesh. The vast majority of these women receive repairs using transvaginal mesh without complications, but a significant minority experienced serious problems.
After the publicity surrounding this issue hit the fan, the lawyers pounced. It has come to light that some law firms, doctors and finance companies are pressuring women into unnecessary surgeries to remove the mesh. Giving new meaning to the term "insult to injury," this phenomenon, according to The New York Times, is leading unsuspecting women to the operating table-even in cases when the removal could worsen the symptoms.
If that's not enough, some unscrupulous hedge funds are financing companies connected with law firms specializing in suing manufacturers of the mesh. These law firms often use overseas telemarketing callers in countries such as India and the Philippines to contact women who are known to have had the mesh surgery, with offers to join in lawsuits to sue the mesh manufacturers.
The New York Times highlighted this growing problem that tends to target women: it is an industry grown out of medical device settlements. There is, for example, a court-ordered, charitable fund called the Common Benefit Trust, which was established out of the Dow Corning breast implant settlement fund from 1998, which also resulted from a faulty medical device. The Common Benefit Trust appears to have used some of its money to fund policy centers, advocacy groups. And a conference on litigation.
Pelvic organ prolapse, a medical issue sought to be treated by the transvaginal mesh, is one of the most common reasons for women to have surgery. It is ranked among the top three reasons that women have hysterectomies.
Then there are racial disparities. Compared with African-American women, Latina and white women had a four to five times higher risk of symptomatic prolapse, thought to be in large part due to the lower rates of African-American women reporting the condition as a problem to doctors. Researchers see this pattern as part of a culture where African-American and/or poor women will not typically see the condition as a problem requiring them to consider surgery.
The revelation that issues like the transvaginal mesh point to disparate treatment of women is not new. All patients-but especially women patients and minority patients who have traditionally been marginalized-deserve better than to be exploited in some of their most vulnerable times.
Those vulnerable times include childbirth and other areas of maternal health. Dr. Niva Lubin-Johnson, president of the National Medical Association, which represents more than 50,000 African-American physicians on issues of health disparities and justice, says, "There is a crisis for AfricanAmerican women that is related to maternal mortality-and that's across any economic level and educational level for African-American women. We are losing in that area," she says.
As for the transvaginal mesh, LubinJohnson says women must take extreme precaution when contacted by anyone about removals of that or any other device. "No, you go talk to your own physician about that and not to someone who is doing a cold call because of some possibility of joining a law suit... Talk to your own physician first; even if they were not the one who put the mesh in."
Since The New York Times began shining a light on these bad behaviors, federal prosecutors from the eastern district of New York have begun investigating the allegations of unnecessary and unneeded vaginal mesh removal surgeries. According to reports, doctors, lawyers, financiers and others who may have been involved in the sham have been subpoenaed.
So, if you're considering medical treatment, be an informed consumer. Be sure to have your health care provider explain all of your options, as well as their possible risks and benefits. Though if these risks are not avoided, by all means, beware of financial lures to have surgeries that you do not need and that could leave you in a condition far worse than before.

Texto completo: Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said in a spring 2017 memo that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein believed then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly could be recruited in an effort to remove President Trump from office.

In an explosive interview with CBS, an excerpt of which was aired Thursday, McCabe asserted Rosenstein did tell Justice Department officials about wearing a “wire” to record conversations with Trump and that he was recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office in the day after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.

The New York Times reports that it obtained an excerpt from one of McCabe's contemporaneous memos on his interactions DOJ officials. He wrote "we discussed the president’s capacity and the possibility he could be removed from office under the 25th Amendment." He further noted that Rosenstein examined the issue and decided that a “majority or 8 of the 15 cabinet officials" would be needed to follow through.

McCabe also said Rosenstein suggested that sympathetic Cabinet members who might join their cause included Sessions and Kelly.

Rosenstein has previously denied the reporting on talk of removing Trump and using a hidden wire, while sources told NBC News that he was only joking about secretly recording the president.

Sessions served as attorney general until November 2018 after more than a year of public scoldings from the president for recusing himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Kelly went on to be Trump's White House chief of staff and retired at the end of last year.

McCabe, a 21-year veteran of the FBI who briefly served as acting FBI director after Comey was fired, has a book due out next week titled "The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump."

In his memoir, he writes Rosenstein spiraled into rage and paranoia after Trump ordered him to write the memo he cited as justification to fire Comey. In a private meeting at the Justice Department days after Comey was pushed out on May 12, McCabe writes Rosenstein was "glassy-eyed" and said he was sleep deprived after he came to the conclusion that the White House had used him. “He said it wasn’t his idea. The president had ordered him to write the memo justifying the firing,” McCabe writes. Rosenstein also said, “There’s no one here that I can trust."

McCabe was fired on March 16, 2018, two days before he planned to retire on his 50th birthday and collect a full pension, after the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General determined that he misled investigators about the role he had in leaking information to the Wall Street Journal in October 2016 about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

He “lacked candor” on four occasions when interviewing with internal investigators, the IG report said. In April, it was revealed that the Justice Department IG had referred its findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Federal prosecutors used a grand jury to investigate McCabe.

McCabe told CBS he ordered an obstruction of justice investigation into Trump after he fired Comey in the spring of 2017.

In a pair of tweets Thursday, Trump tore into McCabe.

"Disgraced FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe pretends to be a 'poor little Angel' when in fact he was a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal & the Russia Hoax - a puppet for Leakin’ James Comey. I.G. report on McCabe was devastating. Part of 'insurance policy' in case I won," Trump said. "Many of the top FBI brass were fired, forced to leave, or left. McCabe’s wife received BIG DOLLARS from Clinton people for her campaign - he gave Hillary a pass. McCabe is a disgrace to the FBI and a disgrace to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

Texto completo: Aaron Feis, 37
Aaron Feis, a security guard and assistant football coach, known for helping his students.
“He selflessly shielded students from the shooter when he was shot. He died a hero and he will forever be in our hearts and memories,” a Twitter account from the school’s football team said.
Meadow Pollack, 18
The day of the shooting, Meadow’s father, Andrew, dialed her number over and over because he couldn’t find her. As he stood outside a Broward hospital, he told a Palm Beach Post reporter all about Meadow, how she wanted to go to Lynn University and become a lawyer. He showed the reporter a picture of Meadow with her cousin, wearing a dark, strapless dress and a smile.
In the wee hours of the morning, Andrew Pollack got his answer. She was gone. Turns out, she had already been shot several times when she crawled over to a freshman girl and wrapped her arms around her to protect her. They both died.
Jaime Guttenberg, 14
Jaime was known for her smarts and her spunk.
On Facebook, her aunt wrote that Jaime was also kind.
“She was a pretty girl with the world’s best smile and her soul was sensitive and compassionate,” Abbie Youkilis said. “She always looked out for the underdog and the bullied and she probably had been kind to the student who shot her.”
Alyssa Alhadeff, 14
Alyssa Alhadeff’s mother asked that people do something fabulous in the name of her daughter, who’d been a competitive soccer player since she was 3.
“Alyssa was a talented soccer player, so smart, an amazing personality, incredible creative writer, and all she had to offer the world was love. She believed in people for being so honest,” Lori Alhadeff wrote.
Scott Beigel, 35
Beigel, a geography teacher, was shot trying to put a locked door between fleeing students and the gunman.
Kelcey Friend, 16, said Beigel “is the strongest person I will ever know. He will never leave my memory.” Friend said if not for Beigel, “I wouldn’t be here. I would be in a hospital or dead.”
Nicholas Dworet, 17
Nicholas, a senior, earned an academic scholarship to the University of Indianapolis and planned to join the school’s swim team in the fall, the Indianapolis Star reported.
As a 12-year-old, Dworet was named swimmer of the month for his performances in the 50-meter freestyle at Coral Springs Swim Club, according to the club’s website.
Alaina Petty, 14
“She just wanted to be your friend,” Alaina’s father, Ryan, told the Sun Sentinel of his youngest child. “It’s impossible to sum up all that Alaina is and all that she means to her family and friends.” She helped people in need, volunteering to clean up after Hurricane Irma and she loved JROTC.
“You could not escape her innate sense right and wrong, but you never felt that she was judging you,” he said. “She just wanted to be your friend.”
Martin Duque Anguiano, 14
“He was a very funny kid, outgoing and sometimes really quiet,” his brother, Miguel, wrote. “He was sweet and caring and loved by all his family. Most of all, he was my baby brother. My family and I have no words to describe the event that has happened.”
Carmen Schentrup, 16
Carmen was a stellar student and a piano player. She was one of 10 Douglas students named finalists in the National Merit Scholarship Program, the school newspaper reported in September.
Alex Schachter, 14
Alex played trombone in the Douglas marching band, his father told The New York Times. The boy’s older brother was also a student at the school and survived the shooting. Their mother had died when Alex was 5.
Luke Hoyer, 15
An avid basketball player, Luke had sprouted to 6-foot-2, his grandmother told The Washington Post. He was a devoted fan of Clemson University and hoped to join Douglas High’s football team in the fall.
“This has devastated our family and we’re all in shock and disbelief. Our hearts are broken. Luke was a beautiful human being and greatly loved,” Luke Hoyer’s uncle, Toni Brownlee, wrote on Facebook. “Also, pray for the other families whose loved were also murdered so cruelly.”
Joaquín Oliver, 17
The death of Joaquín Oliver, a Venezuelan student know as “Guac,” was reported by Univision’s Maria Alesia Sosa, who said it was one of the most painful stories she had ever worked on.
An old friend, Alejandro Marin, told The Palm Beach Post that Joaquín was a great kid who loved family and friends, putting them first. “He was just a super funny kid who always lightened up the mood for everyone,” he said.
Cara Loughran, 14
Cara was remembered by a cousin, Vanessa Allen, on Facebook: “She was the sweetest little girl in the entire world and we are completely devastated.”
She was a member of the Drake School of Irish Dance, according to IrishCentral.com.
Chris Hixon, 49
Hixon was the school’s athletic director and wrestling coach. A dear friend told The Miami Herald why he wasn’t surprised to hear that Hixon speeded in his golf car toward the shooter, not away from it.
“We heard he tried to disarm the shooter,” said Dan Jacob, athletic director and wrestling coach at Coral Springs High and a friend of Hixon’s for 20 years. “He always put others ahead of himself. He was the first to help people out. He just loved teaching and coaching kids and watching them grow up. Many tears have been shed; that’s what he meant to everybody. I’m going to try to be more like Chris.”
Helena Ramsay, 17
Helena, a voracious reader and crafter, was a scholar who spoke quietly. She also loved to rescue cats.
Helena “was dilgent and passionate about school and always worked hard and strived for the best,” her obituary read. “She was quiet in nature; however, Helena’s loving heart spoke.”
Peter Wang, 15
Peter wanted to be a soldier. Standing in his JROTC uniform, he held the door open to allow dozens at Douglas to flee the gunman. But Peter didn’t make it out the door with the others.
Days after he was killed, West Point gave him posthumous letters of admission. He would have been in the class of 2025. Instead, he was buried in his uniform.
Gina Montalto, 14
Gina was a member of the winter guard in the school’s state champion marching band. She also worked very hard at her schoolwork and loved to cook, an aunt who lives in Boca Raton, told the Boca Raton Tribune.
“Gina was one of the kindest, caring, and sweetest people you will probably ever meet. She put others first before herself,” said Shawn Sherlock.
Staff researcher Melanie Mena and staff writers Jorge Milian, Lulu Ramadan, Alexandra Seltzer, Eliot Kleinberg and Jodie Wagner contributed to this story.

Texto completo: Before the 2009 release of "One Second After," which would go on to hold a spot on "The New York Times" Best Seller list for 12 weeks on its way to selling over a million copies, few people were aware of what life might look like in the aftermath of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack.
Author and Montreat College history professor and faculty fellow William Forstchen painted a detailed portrait, set in his hometown of Black Mountain, depicting the struggles modern society would face moving forward in a world devoid of electricity.
In his newest novel, "48 Hours," Forstchen examines humanity in the hours before an eminent extinction level event.
"A CME, or a coronal mass ejection, is a solar storm," Forstchen said. "When I wrote 'One Second After' I didn't even know about it. Hardly anyone did."
Forstchen began reading about the solar storm of 1859, also known as the Carrington Event. The powerful geomagnetic storm produced a CME that interacted with Earth's magnetosphere.
In modern times, such an event would likely disrupt the electric grid. As Forstchen researched the phenomenon, he was drawn to another naturally occurring product of the sun — coronal proton ejections (CPE). Known commonly as solar flares, severe versions of these disruptions can send high levels of radiation toward Earth.
In normal circumstances, he continued, the earth's magnetosphere would protect it from a coronal proton ejection. In "48 Hours," Forstchen conceives a scenario in which a CME peels away the planet's magnetic field before the sun releases a massive solar flare.
"I came across articles where those events happened in reverse," he said. "I just postulated they happen the other way around."
It was easy to imagine a world where "bureaucrats mess everything up and you have your heroes running around and your bad people and cities burning," the author said. "But then I thought, 'that sucks, it's derivative.'"
In "One Second After" and the subsequent books in the trilogy, Forstchen spins a tale of humanity facing an uncertain future in an unforgiving new dark age. The story is a cautionary tale of society's dependence on modern technology and "One Second After" was cited on the floor of U.S. Congress as a "fact-based scenario" of life after an EMP attack.
Its effectiveness as a harbinger of potential disaster was enhanced by the author's use of relatable characters in a real-life setting. While Forstchen intended to ring an alarm about the threat of an EMP, the story itself crystallized once he began thinking about how the loss of electricity might impact the daily lives of everyone.
"I was wrestling with the book and it was going nowhere, and I was at a (Montreat College) graduation ceremony," he recalled. "This is before Anderson Auditorium was updated and it was unbelievably hot in there."
Forstchen had just scratched the idea of building a narrative around a heroic, Jack Ryan-like character as he sweat through the ceremony.
"I'm sitting there, and I'm looking at the audience and looking at my (students) and I had what I call a 'God moment,'" he said. "The entire idea formed that quickly and I'm wondering what happens to everyone in here if this nightmare happens?"
As Forstchen struggled to find the story that would properly relay the threat of a solar-related extinction level event, it was another real setting that prompted his epiphany for "48 Hours."
While lamenting his struggles to develop the story for his latest novel to a friend, he learned of the Springfield Underground in Missouri. The warehouse facility provides 2.5 million square feet of space in a former limestone mine. It contains over three miles of roadway and rail service.
Forstchen realized "we could survive down there."
"I was in a green room waiting to do a television interview and I had another 'God moment,'" he said. "I got home and immediately starting writing this book."
The conflict in the book, however, revolves around just who would have access to the limited space. It pits citizens against government officials in the final hours of the world as we know it.
"Suppose you only have 48 hours, then why do some people survive and some don't?" he said. "Why should senator so-and-so have an assistant who survives while the Nobel Prize laureate guy who lives down the street gets left there?"
Forstchen admits that writing about such a bleak topic is taxing, but as he did with "One Second After," he felt an obligation.
"It's a message," he said. "We all face our mortality individually, but suppose all of humanity was facing its mortality simultaneously. What would you do?"
The book, Forstchen hopes, will make readers ask themselves what's important.
"It's all so fragile," he said of society. "We live in the most technologically advanced civilization in the history of humanity and the sword of Damocles hangs by the slimmest of threads."

Texto completo: Sherman Joseph Katz, 95, of West Hartford died February 11 surrounded by his loving family. He was predeceased by his beloved wife of 65 years, Phyllis (Sachs) Katz. He is survived by his two daughters and their spouses, Marjorie Katz and William Nicholson, of Sudbury, MA and Nancy and Donald Rossler of West Hartford; four grandchildren, Lindsey Nicholson and husband Andrew Beaton, Sara Nicholson and husband Benjamin Gammerman, Michael Rossler, Drew Rossler; and great-grandchildren Patrick and Robert Beaton. He was the son of the late Nathan and Elizabeth (Becker) Katz and brother of Jerome D. Katz.
Sherman attended Mount Hermon School for Boys. He served in the armed forces in World War II, where he received a purple heart. Upon returning from the war, he earned his MBA from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. He then joined his father and brother in the scrap metal business at Jacob A. Katz and Sons, founded by his great-grandfather. Later, he joined Suisman and Blumenthal, during which time he served as President of the Scrap Metal Institute.
He thoroughly enjoyed life, whether it be reading his New York Times daily, traveling the world, singing in the temple choir or starring in the PTA elementary school plays. In later years, when he and Phyllis were not attending opera, theater, symphonies, taking classes, participating in film club, golfing or playing bridge, he relished lounging by the pool in the Florida sun.
Sherman also made giving back to his community a priority. He helped Russian immigrants settle in the Hartford area, and volunteered at the Hebrew Home coffee shop and Saint Joseph's School for Young Children, where he was simply adored.
A service will be held Friday, February 15, 2019 at 10:30 AM at Congregation Beth Israel, 701 Farmington Ave., West Hartford with Rabbi Michael Pincus officiating. Calling hours will be Friday following the funeral service and Saturday evening 4-7 PM at the family home on Cliffmore Road.

Texto completo: Pedro Morales, 76, won three major wrestling titles
Pedro Morales, a Hall of Fame professional wrestler who in the 1970s and '80s became the first to win all three of what were then wrestling's premier championships, died on Monday in Perth Amboy, N.J. He was 76.
His wife, Karen Morales, said the cause was complications from Parkinson's disease.
Mr. Morales, who wrestled professionally for nearly three decades, became a star in the early 1970s. He was known as a vigorous puncher and a master of the Boston crab, a debilitating hold in which he grabbed his opponent's legs, turned him facedown to the mat and pulled the legs back toward his opponent's head.
Mr. Morales tangled with wrestlers such as Mr. Fuji, Bruno Sammartino and Ivan Koloff, whom he beat in Madison Square Garden to win the World Wide Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment) title in 1970.
According to an article in The New York Times in 1972 about one of Mr. Morales' matches, "The biggest problem is not how or if he will win, but how he will get past his adoring fans to his dressing room after the victory."
Mr. Morales held the title for 1,027 days, one of the longest reigns ever, before losing it to Stan Stasiak in 1973.
Mr. Morales retired in 1987 and for a time was a Spanish-language commentator for WWE and World Championship Wrestling. He was inducted into what is now the WWE Hall of Fame in 1995.
In one of Mr. Morales' best-remembered matches, he faced Pittsburgh's Mr. Sammartino, who was often his ally, in front of more than 20,000 people at Shea Stadium in 1972. A curfew ordinance forced the marathon 75-minute match to end in a draw.
In addition to his wife, with whom he lived in Woodbridge, N.J., he is survived by a sister, Aida Morales.

Brie Larson doesn’t want you reviewing her superhero movie, white males

Texto completo: As the actress embarks on a publicity tour for the first female-led Marvel movie, Brie Larson has a message for white males: Move to the back of the line.

The Oscar winner said she picked Keah Brown to interview her for a recent Marie Claire profile because the journalist has cerebral palsy and is a woman of color. That’s commendable. Less so is Larson’s posturing.

“About a year ago,” Larson explains in the interview, “I started paying attention to what my press days looked like and the critics reviewing movies, and noticed it appeared to be overwhelmingly white male.”

Shifting that dynamic and elevating an obscure journalist by asking her to profile you is a kind thing to do but also, and I want to add this without cynicism, it's a great way to get good press.

Here’s what Brown says about Larson in her Marie Claire story:

"Meeting Larson in person for the first time, it’s immediately clear why she was chosen for this role. Passionate, funny, genuine and kind, she’s eager to see the diverse and inclusive world she lives in reflected back on the big screen. She might not be a superhero in real life, but she’s ready to fight like one to make the world better."

Would a white male have said that? Well, we’ll never know.

Despite Larson’s fixation on gender, Manohla Dargis, a female movie reviewer at the New York Times, was not in love with “Room,” the movie that gave Larson her Oscar for Best Actress.

White males from Rolling Stone and New York magazine liked her performance much more. To Dargis, Larson was an "overly muted supporting player." But Rolling Stone’s Peter Traverse called her "magnificent," and New York magazine’s David Edelstein said he didn’t "know how to do [her] justice."

Nevertheless, the “Captain Marvel” star still wants dudes to put down their pens and tape recorders. She made a noninclusive point about inclusion last summer when she argued that male movie reviewers should shut up about “A Wrinkle in Time” because it wasn’t made for them.

“I don’t want to hear what a white man has to say about ‘A Wrinkle in Time.’ I want to hear what a woman of color, a biracial woman has to say about the film,” Larson said during an acceptance speech. Never mind that “A Wrinkle in Time” was a film that everyone desperately wanted to like but was about as close to the book as Earth is to Madeleine L'Engle’s planet Camazotz. Even a white man could see that.

Larson does have a point, however. If you want a positive interview experience, choose a journalist who is more likely to understand your background. If you want a positive movie review, choose a reviewer who will empathize with the directorial decisions behind the film, even if the execution falls short. If “Captain Marvel” flops, at least it has diversity for sympathetic movie reviewers to acclaim.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that Minnesota U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar should resign from Congress or not be allowed to serve on committees following her tweet about Israel, which politicians from both parties decried as anti-Semitic.
"Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress," Trump said to reporters at a White House Cabinet meeting. He also called her apology "lame."
It was the latest fallout for Omar, whose apology came Monday afternoon following an unusual public rebuke from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other House Democratic leaders. Omar's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's remarks.
In a tweet on Sunday, Omar posted a song lyric, "It's all about the Benjamins, baby" -- which she later clarified to say was meant to suggest that money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) drove U.S. politicians to support Israel. It was not the first time that Omar has tweeted criticism of Israel, and before the latest tweet she had already had to work to allay concerns among Twin Cities Jewish groups about past online remarks.
"Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes. My intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole," Omar wrote in her apology. She added that she continues to be concerned by the power of lobbyists in Washington, not just AIPAC but others like the National Rifle Association and the fossil fuel industry.
The White House doubled down on its criticism, with Vice President Mike Pence calling her tweets a disgrace and her apology inadequate. "Those who engage in anti-Semitic tropes should not just be denounced, they should face consequences for their words," his tweet Tuesday night said.
Several other U.S. House Democrats were critical of Omar's tweet, including her fellow Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who is Jewish. Omar has met with several of those members, including Phillips, following the public blowup.
"I spoke privately with Rep. Ilhan Omar today before issuing a statement in the hopes of converting a painful experience into a learning opportunity and a mutual commitment to pursue understanding," Phillips said in a statement Monday night. "We agreed to move forward with a shared goal of working collaboratively to combat hatred and intolerance towards all persecuted communities, and commit to respectful debate of the issues important to each of us."
Another critic was Rep. Eliot Engel, the New York Democrat who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Omar, who took office at the beginning of January, won a coveted spot on that panel, as did Phillips. Republicans have called for her removal, but Democratic leaders have not done so.
"Anti-Semitism in any form is unacceptable, and it's shocking to hear a Member of Congress invoke the anti-Semitic trope of 'Jewish money,' " Engel said in a statement in response to Omar's tweet.
Trump's response on Tuesday to a question from a reporter about Omar was not the first time he talked about her latest controversy. He also commented Monday night in El Paso, Texas: "I think it was a terrible statement and I don't think her apology was adequate."
Trump himself has been the subject of frequent criticism from Democrats and some Republicans for tweets and public statements about various groups of people. In one notable example, Trump said there were "some very fine people on both sides" at a public clash between white nationalists and protesters in Virginia. He has also repeatedly referred to Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who once claimed American Indian heritage, as "Pocahontas."
Omar, who has been a vociferous critic of Trump, did not respond on Twitter to his remarks about her. Another freshman House Democrat with a large Twitter following, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, on Tuesday contrasted Omar's reaction to the fallout from her tweet with that of Trump himself.
"Unlike this President, [Omar] demonstrated a capacity to acknowledge pain & apologize, use the opportunity to learn history of antisemitism, [and] grow from it while clarifying her stance," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who preceded Omar as Minnesota's Fifth District U.S. representative, also faced allegations of anti-Semitism for past associations with the Nation of Islam. He said that Omar did the right thing by apologizing.
In arguing for Omar to be stripped of committee assignments, some Republicans cited the recent case of Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King. House GOP leaders condemned King and removed him from his committees following a New York Times interview in which he said, among other things: "White nationalist, white supremacist, western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?"
King later said in a House floor speech that "I regret the heartburn that has poured forth upon this Congress and this country and especially in my state and in my congressional district."
In her own statement, Omar wrote: "I unequivocally apologize."

Trump to sign order pushing artificial intelligence

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order meant to spur the development and regulation of artificial intelligence, technology that many experts believe will define the future of everything from consumer products to health care to warfare.
AI experts across industry, academia and government have long called on the Trump administration to make the development of artificial intelligence a major priority. Last spring, worried that the United States was not keeping pace with China and other countries, Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, sent a memo to the White House imploring the president to create a national strategy on AI.
Now, Trump is about to take that step, though this "American AI Initiative" may not be as bold as some had hoped.
The executive order aims to better educate workers in the field, improve access to the cloud computing services and data needed to build AI systems, and promote cooperation with foreign powers, a senior administration official said on a conference call with reporters Sunday. But the order does not set aside funds for AI research and development, and the administration provided few details on how it will put its new policies into effect.
The United States is engaged in an increasingly bitter trade war with China. And while American companies like Google and Amazon are leaders in the field, AI experts are concerned that China could surpass the United States in the development of technologies that will power surveillance systems and autonomous weapons as well as driverless cars and a wide range of internet services.
In July 2017, China unveiled a plan to become the world leader in AI, aiming to create an industry worth $150 billion to its economy by 2030, and two Chinese cities promised to invest $7 billion in the effort. Other governments, too, began making large investments, including South Korea, Britain, France and Canada.
In the United States, the Defense Department has accelerated efforts to embrace AI, shifting $75 million of its annual budget to a new office that will develop these technologies. Other government agencies also have major projects in the works. But many AI experts have worried that the top talent in the United States is moving to companies like Google and Amazon and away from government agencies.
Last year, these concerns increased when Google pulled out of a project to build AI for the Pentagon after employees protested that the technology they were working on could be used for lethal purposes. Companies like Google are also expanding their operations in countries like China, France and Canada, as the AI talent in those countries continues to expand.
In its briefing with reporters, the administration said it would increase efforts to educate American workers in the field. It plans to work with the National Council for the American Worker to create educational efforts through industry and academia, and it will call on government agencies to develop fellowships related to AI.
But the senior official did not provide specifics on how the United States will track the progress of these efforts.

'Green New Deal' reeks of communism

Texto completo: Kermit the Frog was wrong. It is now easy to be "green." The evidence is the "Green New Deal," which CNN describes as a "… 10-year 'economic mobilization' that would phase out fossil fuel use and overhaul the nation's infrastructure while building whole new layers into the existing social safety net." The 14-page resolution was proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.).
Conservatives mock her for proposing, among other things, the complete transformation of every building in the U.S. and trains that would span the oceans as airplanes are phased out. Ocasio-Cortez doesn't appear to know how any of this will be paid for, but when one is liberal it doesn't matter. It's the thought that counts, not the outcome.
It is helpful to remember how what once seemed extreme has now become accepted. Think of abortion, which most of the country opposed in the late 19th century. Now our elected officials advocate for it. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently wrote a scathing op-ed in The New York Times supporting late-term abortions in his state.
Same-sex marriage, the outlawing of prayer and Bible reading in public schools and ending the Pledge of Allegiance in some schools was once thought extreme and fantastical.
Now we have the extreme Green New Deal, which even addresses flatulent cows and the methane they emit. CNBC reports the plan "aimed to have the U.S. creating 'net-zero' greenhouse gases in 10 years," lawmakers explaining: "We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast."
Question. Since there are more humans than cows, shouldn't the deal have included human flatulence, along with information on how they intend to control that?
Ocasio-Cortez was quick to backtrack.
"At the time this story was published, writes CNBC, the FAQ page with the phrase 'farting cows' appeared to have been removed from Ocasio-Cortez's website. Fox News' John Roberts reported that the language was tweaked to 'emissions from cows' in an update, which also appears to have been deleted."
In separate interviews, Ocasio-Cortez first admitted her proposal would require "massive government intervention," but later reversed herself, claiming it is the right wing that is mischaracterizing her proposal about more government intrusion into our lives.
The left is completely transparent now. In the words of Barack Obama, they do plan to "fundamentally transform the United States of America." Millennials, especially, are fine with this because they have had such nonsense fed to them in public schools and by university professors. No evidence that contradicts their doctrines can persuade them. They accept what they have been told as a cult member accepts what its leader tells them.
Need proof? Read a report by the National Association of Scholars on the state of civics education in U.S. public schools. An analysis of the 525-page document on thefederalist.com found that even in places where civics education remains, it is being "transformed into a political machine to push left-wing causes, undermine American government and incite civil unrest. … The "New Civics" uses attractive, bipartisan-sounding works like 'civics' and 'service learning' to trick Americans and their representatives into allowing progressive political machinery to hijack public funds and young minds."
The left used to mask their agenda for fear of backlash. Now they are open about their views. The response should go beyond ridicule. What we need is pushback that contains scientific, economic and political arguments and supplants feelings with facts.
Want more proof that failed liberal policies never produce a change of direction, but a doubling down on discredited ideas? A task force created by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel proposes giving some Chicago families $1,000 per month with no strings attached. The idea is to break the cycle of poverty, but that assumes recipients use taxpayer money wisely. I'm sure a guaranteed check for doing nothing will be all the incentive some need to liberate themselves from an addiction to government. It has worked so well at the federal level, hasn't it?
Several Democratic presidential candidates support the "Green New Deal, though it reeks of communism. After the ridicule, opponents had better find a way to communicate the truth, or we risk becoming another Venezuela.

Texto completo: A class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday by three women who attend Yale University seeks to ban the school's all-male fraternities from considering gender in admission decisions.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Connecticut against Yale University and nine fraternities, is brought by students who allege sexual assault, harassment and discrimination plague the fraternities. The plaintiffs' lawyers say they believe it is the first time students have sued a university to "gender integrate" fraternities.
The three students say they have been groped at fraternity parties and know other students who were either sexually assaulted or harassed at the parties. They also allege that fraternities unfairly provide male students greater networking opportunities than sororities provide to female students.
"Yale is a microcosm of the ongoing epidemic of sexual harassment and assault at all-male fraternities," the lawsuit, as published by the New York Times, reads. It criticizes "Separate but equal" Greek life — fraternities for males and sororities for females — for reinforcing "gender norms, stereotypes, and prejudices. "
Jan. 29: TV stars say #MeToo movement has opened male eyes at work
Voices: Why fraternities are struggling to break free from elitist roots
One of the plaintiffs said the fraternities are "breeding a very toxic sexual culture. " Ry Walker also said the organizations give "undue economic and professional benefits to the male fraternity members. "
Walker, like the other plaintiffs, said she has been denied membership to all-male fraternities at the school.
Rikki Klieman, a CBS News legal analyst, told the network that the lawsuit was "enormously complicated" and appeared to have contradictory goals: integrating women into an environment while alleging that environment is plagued of sexual assault. Klieman questioned why the plaintiffs weren't seeking to ban the fraternities.
Plaintiff Anna McNeil told the network that the students believe seeking gender integration is "more feasible. " Plaintiff Ellie Singer said the lawsuit aims to create a "paradigm shift. "
A Yale spokesman, Tom Conroy, said he did not have a comment on the lawsuit. But he pointed to a previous message about the school's efforts to bring about more social opportunities for students on campus following allegations of a sexually hostile climate at the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Joan Gilbride, an attorney for the fraternities, said the lawsuit's accusations are baseless.

Texto completo: Corey Maggette, a former Clipper who has been part of team broadcasts this season as an analyst for FS West, has been accused of raping a woman during his time at Duke 20 years ago.
The New York Times reported the allegation, citing an interview with a friend of the woman, Meredith Watson, and Facebook messages she sent a friend about the alleged incident. Watson also has accused Justin Fairfax, Virginia's lieutenant governor, of raping her.
Maggette denied the accusation through a spokesman, referring to a statement released to the New York Times: "It has only been through media accounts and a statement from Meredith Watson's lawyer that I first learned or heard of anything about these sexual assault allegations. I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge."

Maggette played at Duke in the 1998-99 season before beginning a 14-year NBA career. He has covered the Clippers this season as a pregame and postgame analyst and color commentator.
He did not work during the Clippers game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday.
"FOX Sports takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and we are looking into the matter," a network spokeswoman wrote in an email. "We have no further comment at this time."
Duke is investigating the allegation, per multiple reports.
'Surreal' experience
NBA coaches talk often, but the conversations Doc Rivers shared during the 2012-13 season were unlike any before in his career.
It was his son Austin's rookie season in the NBA and coaches who'd known Austin as a child called the elder Rivers to express their wonderment about where the time had gone.
"They would call like, 'I'm coaching against Austin?' " Rivers said.
Oh, how he would have loved to have expressed a similar sentiment Monday to Flip Saunders.
The Clippers' game Monday marked Rivers' first time facing Saunders' 32-year-old son, Ryan, who last month was selected interim coach of the Timberwolves.
Rivers, who has known Ryan Saunders since he was in elementary school, called it "surreal."
"I really wish Flip was here tonight," he said. "It'd be pretty cool, the fact I'm coaching against his son."
Flip Saunders, a longtime Timberwolves coach who died in 2015 from Hodgkin's lymphoma, was "as close as I can be with a guy," Rivers said. When the Washington Wizards fired Saunders in 2012, Saunders became a de facto Boston Celtics assistant during that year's playoffs at Rivers' invitation.
The two were "very close," Ryan Saunders said. "When we'd go to L.A. and play, my dad and I wouldn't be able to get dinner because he'd be going to have dinner with Doc."
Saunders is younger than three of the Timberwolves' players but has more NBA experience than many coaches in the league after joining the Wizards out of college in 2009. He was promoted upon the January firing of Tom Thibodeau, another of Rivers' close friends in coaching. It wasn't a unique situation in Rivers' career -- friends have succeeded friends before, he said -- but he called it nonetheless a "tough one."
"I called Ryan right away and wished him luck," Rivers said, "and made sure he reached out to Thibs and did all the right things coming in. He did all those things."
Mates laud Harrell
Montrezl Harrell, the Clippers' reserve center, received a standing ovation Monday from his teammates as they reviewed Saturday's victory at Boston.
The reason? Not his rim-rattling dunks, nor his energy, but his passing.
Rivers believed that two assists by Harrell in the third quarter kick-started a rally that erased a 28-point deficit and resulted in a Clippers victory.
In his fourth NBA season, Harrell is averaging a career-high 1.7 assists a game, and while he'll never lead the Clippers in assists, his improvement has been necessary as defenses focus more on stopping Harrell whether in the post or running to the rim off pick-and-rolls.
He matched a career high for one half Thursday with four assists against the Indiana Pacers.
"Trez has come from not being an offensive player in his career ... to now being one getting a lot of support as far as helps and digs and traps," Rivers said. "His next stage is now seeing open guys and he did it over and over."

Texto completo: The 1992 Winter Olympics silver medalist in men's figure skating likes to encourage people competing in ice skating.
So when Paul Wylie of Dallas elected to come to Santa Fe to conduct several private and public clinics and seminars at Genoveva Chavez Community Center on Friday and Saturday, he let it be known to organizers that he welcomed all levels of skaters.
"I said, 'Don't shy away from putting me in front of the basic [level] twos and threes and fours," Wylie said. "I love to teach that. I like to teach [kids at] that very beginner level. I don't get to do it as often because I feel like, a lot of times, clubs comes in and say, 'We want you to work with our elite skaters.' This way, you can really have an impact with people."
Tammy Berendzen, president of the Santa Fe Skating Club, brought Wylie in to oversee some of the state's elite skaters Friday.
He also will do three classes Saturday with lower-level skaters, most of whom are with the club's "Learn to Skate" program. Wylie will also give a keynote address in the Chavez Center's community room Saturday afternoon.
Wylie held a similar seminar two years ago, and enjoyed it so much that he decided to put on another series this weekend. It also gave him a chance to scratch another itch of his.
"I bought the Mountain Collective Pass, which had days at Taos [Ski Valley]," Wylie said with a smirk, referring to the ski promotion that allows pass members access to 17 resorts.
"He just wanted to ski New Mexico," Berendzen said with a laugh.
Wylie was a constant presence Friday at the Chavez Center. He had private sessions in the morning and afternoon before conducting an on-ice seminar with about 30 skaters Friday evening. Berendzen said Wylie will float from group to group as about 99 skaters from the "Learn to Skate" program will meet Saturday.
"This is huge," Berendzen said of Wylie's appearance at the Chavez Center. "We put a lot of time and energy, the whole club does, into the 'Learn to Skate' program. The ability to give back to the kids -- what they don't quite know what they are going to get until [Saturday] -- but being able to interact with an Olympian.
"And there is nothing like watching Paul do his edging, and it's a great thing to be able to give back to the Santa Fe skating community and inspire the kids."
Wylie's career is a case study in rising above adversity. Wylie started skating at the age of 3, then he and his family moved to Colorado when he was 11 so he could work with skating coach Carlos Fassi.
He developed into one of the top skaters in the country, finishing second in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 1988, 1990 and 1992.
Even though he earned a spot on the 1992 U.S. team, controversy swirled around him because of his past poor performances at the world championships and a less-than-stellar effort at the 1992 U.S. Championships.
"I sometimes will talk about the New York Times reporter who called me out," Wylie said. "When I was named to the Olympic team, he said I was a 'pathetic figure in the sport.' I made the Olympic team by one-tenth of a point, and people were of the opinion that I shouldn't even be going."
Wylie said he focused on staying in a positive mindset during the 35 days between the U.S. Championships and the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. It worked, and he won the silver medal. He is one of three U.S. men's singles skaters to earn an Olympic medal in the past
27 years. That was despite the voice that lingered in his head.
"You wake up the day of the short program, and you're still concerned that you're the loser," Wylie said. "That you're never going to overcome this issue you have of messing up the program. You have to put the chips down, because it's life. You have to put the chips down and take a risk, otherwise you never find out what you're capable of."
Wylie also competed at the time when figure skating was viewed as one of the premier Olympic events in the United States, and television ratings were consistently high. However, he noted that the changing culture of sports in the country, in which specialization of a particular sport has become more the norm, plus the explosion of networks to cater to a wide variety of tastes has led to a lessened interest in skating.
"With proliferation of cable networks, things became more niche," Wylie said. "So skating has had the balloon pop over the last few years. It was going to be hard to keep up with that kind of exposure."
That coupled with the recent struggles for the U.S. figure skating program, which has brought home just four Olympic gold medals since 1992 and no singles medals in the last two Games, has led to a rebuilding phase. Wylie, though, has high hopes for recent U.S champions Nathan Chen and 13-year-old Alysa Liu.
"I am very impressed with some of the top-level skaters, including Nathan Chen," Wylie said. "He has had a perfect season so far, even though he's a freshman at Yale. ... I feel like skating has become popular with the serious athlete, and it is a less of a recreational thing that kids do today.
"If we get a couple of serious athletes who turn into stars, we'll see people say, 'Oh, that's a real cool sport, that's fun to do.' "
Wylie said all is takes is one person to make the breakthrough. "It takes a little vision from folks like Tammy and Joel [Berendzen's husband], and also from coaches, to see you can build a program," Wylie said. "Then, those athletes wind up going to nationals, then internationals and the Olympics. So, who knows?
"What I see is there is a very serious athlete, that one in a 100, and they stick around. And it's fun to see it."

AMID SANCTIONS CALLS, SAUDIS DENY PRINCE HAD ROLE IN JOURNALIST’S SLAYING

Texto completo: WASHINGTON  Saudi Arabia is denying that the kingdoms crown prince had a role in the killing of a Washington Post columnist amid calls from members of Congress for U.S. sanctions on the kingdom.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir told reporters Friday in Washington that people should await the results of the trial of the suspects in the October killing of Jamal Khashoggi as well as the end of an ongoing investigation before drawing any conclusions.

Al-Jubeir was meeting with members of Congress as some lawmakers seek to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of what they believe is involvement by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the slaying of Khashoggi, who wrote columns critical of the Saudi government while living in self-imposed exile in Virginia.

His meetings came as the New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted a 2017 conversation in which the crown prince told a top aide that he would use a bullet on Khashoggi if the columnist did not return to Saudi Arabia.

Al-Jubeir dismissed the report along with the possibility that the crown prince had any role in the death of Khashoggi, who was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

We know that the crown prince did not order this. We know that this was a rogue operation, he said. The killing, he said repeatedly, was a terrible crime and those responsible will be held accountable.

Lawmakers, including Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduced legislation Friday that would prohibit certain arms sales to Saudi Arabia in response to the killing and its role in Yemen.

Fees? Online referrals? Here are some tips to find the right lawyer

Texto completo: Lawyers don’t know everything.
Wait, what? Sure, we pretend to at family dinners, but that’s different.
The truth is in modern times no one lawyer can know every area of law. Think about it — the tax code alone is a gaztrillion pages long (that’s a legal term). How could we know and understand that along with the California Family Law code, which is a modzillion pages (legalese again, sorry)? That’s why we specialize in one, maybe two or three related areas of law. And that’s why you should be careful and methodical in choosing your attorney.
So how do you choose?
First, be clear about what kind of lawyer you need. Is this a real estate transaction? Do you need a will or trust? Are you being sued in a business transaction? Were you injured and contemplating a lawsuit? Is a divorce looming? Those are matters for different types of attorneys. (If you find one attorney who claims to do all of that, please run far away. They can’t possibly do it all well.)
Next, find a referral.
Talk to friends, neighbors, and, most importantly, other professionals to find out what lawyers practice in the area where you need help and who are the good ones. Lawyers are like other business folks (except when arguing with one, or so I’m told) — there are great ones, mediocre ones and bad ones. Talking to someone who has worked with a specific attorney can tell you a lot you need to know. Was the attorney responsive? Reasonable? Knowledgeable? You want those things.
Check the lawyer’s standing
The California state bar website calbar.ca.gov will let you know if the attorney is licensed, what their practice area is, and whether they’ve had any disciplinary proceedings.
I recently had a client bring me their estate planning documents which were so poorly prepared I looked up the attorney who drafted them. He’d been disbarred years before he prepared their documents. I’m sure the client would not have hired him if they had known that, which would have saved them time and money.
I’m less fond of consumer review sites, as there is no neutral party administering what gets posted, as there is with the State Bar, but go ahead and check. If you find a pattern of complaints (as opposed to one or two outliers) you may learn that’s not the right attorney for you.
Meet and talk to the attorney
Most attorneys offer free consultations. You should feel free to ask questions about their experience, their fees, their areas of practice and what you can expect if they handle your matter.
I’ll be honest, we’re rarely asked these questions, but I like it when someone does ask. I know that’s going to be an engaged and sharp client. The point of the conversation is to understand what it will be like to work with that particular attorney. And an important part of that is learning whether you’ll be comfortable and happy working with him.
If your matter involves estate planning or a divorce, you will be sharing a lot of personal information about your family and finances. You should feel comfortable doing that. If your matter involves a lawsuit, you’re likely to be stressed and emotional at times — again, you need to be comfortable with the attorney and confident in her abilities.
My dog can help you out here. Years ago I had a beagle battling cancer. His oncologist was cold and pessimistic and made our appointments much more difficult to bear.
Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and asked to be assigned to a different doctor. The clinic’s owner said, “that’s why we have several doctors on staff, we want you to be comfortable.” The next doctor was fabulous and made the whole experience easier. I’m guessing that’s why California has so many lawyers — so you can find the right one.
One last thought: Though it’s tempting and an important factor, don’t let fees make the decision for you. After all, you can get a car for $500. That doesn’t mean it will get you where you need to be.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Trump administration was set to ignore a Friday deadline for giving the Senate a full accounting of the role of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in the brutal slaying of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi four months ago.
The administration, which has consistently sought to shield Saudi rulers from blame, had until midnight Friday to answer senators' questions about whether Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, as U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded, and what additional sanctions should be placed on the government in Riyadh.
The deadline was set by Democratic and Republican senators, who wrote the president on Oct. 10 - slightly more than a week after Khashoggi's disappearance - calling for an investigation.
Senators said Trump was obliged by law to answer within 120 days. Administration officials contended, however, that the law was not binding and that the president could ignore the senators' demands.
A top Saudi official, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir, on Friday insisted the crown prince had no role in Khashoggi's slaying, saying the trial of the suspects and the ongoing investigation would show it was a "rogue operation" with no official backing.
The New York Times reported Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted a 2017 conversation in which Mohamed told a top aide that he would use "a bullet" on Khashoggi, a regime critic, if he did not return home to Saudi Arabia.
Fire at Brazilian soccer academy kills 10, injures 3
RIO DE JANEIRO - Fire tore through the sleeping quarters of an academy for one of Brazil's most popular professional soccer clubs Friday, killing 10 people and injuring three, most likely teenage players, authorities said.
Firefighters were called just after 5 a.m. local time to the sprawling Ninho de Urubu training grounds of the Flamengo soccer club in Rio de Janeiro.
The cause of the fire was not known.
Those killed were not immediately identified by the club but they were athletes, a health official said.
Two of the injured youths were hospitalized in stable condition and one was in critical condition. The ages of the injured were 14, 15 and 16, according to a fire official.
Several people who appeared to be relatives entered the complex without speaking to reporters.
Stone says he should be free
to speak in Russia probe case
WASHINGTON - A federal judge shouldn't bar longtime Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone from making public statements about his criminal case in the Russia investigation, his attorneys said Friday.
Defense lawyers say in a court filing that any limits on Stone's public comments would infringe on his right to free speech.
They made the argument as U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is considering a gag order preventing both sides in the case from making public statements that could prejudice potential jurors.
Jackson raised the issue last week as she told Stone not to treat his criminal case like a "book tour," referring to post-indictment talk show appearances Stone made in which he attacked the investigation as politically motivated.
Iran's top leader defends chants of 'Death to America' by crowds
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is defending "Death to America" chants that are standard fare at anti-U.S. rallies across Iran but says the chanting is aimed at America's leaders and not its people.
Khamenei's website on Friday quoted him as saying the chant means "death to U.S. leaders, death to (President Donald) Trump and John Bolton and (Mike) Pompeo."
He says the Iranian people "will not stop saying 'Death to America' as long as the U.S. acts malicious" toward Iran.
Khamenei was referring to Trump's State of the Union address this week in which the American president, among other things, said: "We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants 'Death to America.' "
France presses Italy in historic EU dispute
PARIS - France's pro-EU government and Italy's populist leaders sparred anew Friday amid the neighbors' biggest diplomatic spat since World War II.
French officials said Friday that this week's recall of French Ambassador Christian Masset was prompted by months of "unfounded attacks" from Italian government members Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, who have criticized French President Emmanuel Macron's economic and migration policies.
But the main trigger for the crisis appeared to be Di Maio's meeting in a Paris suburb this week with members of the yellow vests - a French anti-government movement seeking seats in the European Parliament - without informing French leaders, who considered it an unwarranted intrusion into the nation's internal affairs.
Steep fall in enforcement by EPA seen since 2016
WASHINGTON - Civil and criminal crackdowns on polluters dropped sharply in the second year of the Trump administration, according to 2018 enforcement figures released Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Trump administration EPA says the agency is taking a new tack with polluters, giving states more of a role in regulation and enforcement and stressing education and voluntary compliance with offenders as well as fines and criminal prosecution.
The EPA has been one of the most active agencies overall in carrying out the deregulatory goals of President Donald Trump.
Declines include civil investigations carried out by the agency, which fell to 22 last year, down from 40 in 2017 and 125 in 2016, the last year of the Obama administration.
Health exam: President Donald Trump is "in very good health" and expected to remain healthy for "the duration of his Presidency, and beyond," the president's doctor said Friday after a physical exam by 11 specialists. The White House did not release more details and did not say whether any would be released.
In Washington: Amid a measles outbreak that has sickened more than 50 people in the Pacific Northwest, Washington lawmakers heard testimony Friday on a bill that would remove parents' ability to claim a personal or philosophical exemption to opt school-age kids out of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

Texto completo: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman once discussed using "a bullet" on Jamal Khashoggi, despite the royal family trying to distance itself from the dissident Saudi journalist's murder, according to a report.

Crown Prince Mohammed made the comment in a 2017 conversation intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies, the New York Times reported Thursday. It was uncovered as the National Security Agency and other agencies examine the crown prince's voice and text communications as part of an investigation into Khashoggi's death.

Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government who wrote for the Washington Post, was killed on Oct. 2 during a visit to the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul, where he had an appointment to collect paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee. Once inside the building, he was reportedly greeted by a 15-person team, described as an assassination squad, who strangled him and dismembered his body.

The intercepted discussion between Crown Prince Mohammed and adviser Turki Aldakhil, a former Saudi TV executive, hinged on whether they could lure Khashoggi back to the kingdom with a job. The crown prince, who expressed skepticism that their plan would work, said he would resort to "a bullet" if need be. The official analysis concluded that Crown Prince Mohammed may not have employed the phrase literally, but it indicted the seriousness with which he viewed the threat Khashoggi posed to his reputation. The analysts emphasized that there was no evidence that Aldakhil knew about any plot to capture or kill Khashoggi.

The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to the Times' request for comment, while the NSA and the CIA declined to provide a statement. Aldakhil denied the allegations as "categorically false."

"They appear to be a continuation of various efforts by different parties to connect His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to this horrific crime. These efforts will prove futile," Aldakhil told the paper.

President Trump has repeatedly downplayed Crown Prince Mohammed's involvement in Khashoggi's murder, citing the close financial ties between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. The CIA, however, found last year with "high confidence" that the crown prince was implicated in the plan. The Saudi royal court, for its part, has claimed the columnist was killed in a rogue rendition operation gone wrong.

The Trump administration, which also has a cosy personal relationship with Crown Prince Mohammed through Jared Kushner, has sanctioned 17 Saudis believed to be responsible for Khashoggi's death; 11 people have also been charged by Saudi prosecutors over his killing, five of whom face the death penalty.

The Grammys head into the great wide open

Texto completo: Even in the age of Peak TV and Netflix-documentary glut, music is the popular art form on which it's most difficult to get a complete handle — the weekly new-release reserves topped the 100-album mark last year quite a few times, and that's not even counting the myriad reissues released by catalog-stuffed labels. So the Grammy Awards, in theory meant to represent the “best" popular music, will always have more naysayers than satisfied observers when they announce their nominees, let alone their winners.
This year's ceremony — the 61st, which airs Sunday night at 8 on CBS — is a culmination of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences' first attempt to change that. Following the lead of the Academy Awards, which widened the best picture nomination field from five nominees to 10 in 2009, the Grammys have welcomed more members into the running for certain categories, including the four awards with cross-genre nomination slates: album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, and best new artist. In addition, the recording academy added more than 900 women and people of color to the Grammys' voting ranks last October.
This widening is welcome, long overdue, and, given the slate of nominees for those categories in particular this year, probably not dramatic enough. This year's top-four categories all boast critical favorites like Brandi Carlile and Janelle Monáe, commercial leviathans like Drake and Cardi B, and head-scratchers like Greta Van Fleet and Post Malone. But they also feel somewhat incomplete, and only partially representative of what music looked like between Oct. 1, 2017, and Sept. 30, 2018.
This year, Pulitzer-winning MC Kendrick Lamar and cross-continental mogul Drake led the nominations, with eight and seven respectively. Lamar's nominations stem mostly from the soundtrack for “Black Panther"; he co-executive produced “Black Panther the Album," and rapped on the brooding SZA collaboration “All the Stars," which is nominated for song and record of the year. Drake's nominations come from his lengthy, sensitive “Scorpion," which broke streaming records and spawned a slew of singles, including the watery, determined “God's Plan," also nominated for song and record of the year. This tracks with the way hip-hop in general — and Drake, specifically — dominated music in 2018.
Hip-hop is well-represented in this year's Big Four categories thanks to Drake and Lamar, as well as Bronx-born supernova Cardi B, chill-bro exemplar Post Malone, and multi-hyphenate Childish Gambino (a.k.a. “Atlanta" creator and former “Community" star Donald Glover). Dropping below those four categories, though, shows that the recording academy's push for greater representation has had ripple effects, although they're not all evenly spread out.
Hip-hop and R&B are at the nexus of energy for pop music right now, and the nominees in those genres' respective categories are probably the best-realized of this year. Take the competition for best urban contemporary album: Jay-Z and Beyoncé's joint effort as the Carters, “Everything Is Love," leads the pack in Q rating, but its competitors are varied and great. Chloe x Halle's 21st-century update of the blood-harmonies ideal, Chris Dave & the Drumhedz' multi-headed soul music hydra, Miguel's sun-baked dystopia, and Meshell Ndegeocello's reimagination of the late 20th-century's soul-pop smashes are all worthy of winning, but more importantly, they're worthy of being elevated to “important album" status.
If only the winner of that category was able to appear on TV. The producers of the Grammy telecast have a problem similar to the academy's voting members: Too much to include in a 24-hour telecast, let alone a three-hours-and-change one. This year's Grammys have 84 categories; last year's telecast showed nine presentations, with the rest shunted off to the afternoon-long Grammy Awards Premiere Ceremony. Online video has, at least, made that ceremony more accessible to viewers. (It streams live at www.grammy.com on Sunday beginning at 3:30 p.m.)
The rest of the show is made up of performances, which, if years past and the current trickle of announcements are anything to go by, will consist largely of sometimes-understandable, sometimes yikes-inducing pairings of artists from past and present generations — country titan Dolly Parton with spiritual descendants Kacey Musgraves and Maren Morris, moany alt-rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers with moany sorta-rapper Post Malone. A few big names will be missing — Lamar, Drake, and Glover all turned down offers to perform, according to a New York Times interview with producer Ken Ehrlich, while the music trade pub Hits reported that Ariana Grande, whose new album “thank u, next" comes out Friday, dropped out after clashing with the show's producers over song choice.
But even with those absences, there's enough talent in music right now that there will probably be at least one performance that wows observers in the moment. My money's on Carlile, whose starkly felt songs got “Grey's Anatomy" and Olympic-ad pickup, and who has enough in-the-biz fans to inspire a tribute album featuring Parton, Pearl Jam, and Adele — but who has yet to win a Grammy. A sweeter comeback story couldn't be told.

What Trump Got Wrong In Remarks On Abortion

Texto completo: President Trump on Tuesday evening asked Congress to ban a type of abortion often referred to as "late-term abortion."
He said he wanted to protect "children who can feel pain in the mother's womb." He scorned New York's recently passed Reproductive Health Act, saying that lawmakers had "cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth." It was an image he has used before, including in a campaign debate with Hillary Clinton.
There are inaccuracies and gray areas in Mr. Trump's assertions. Here's an explanation of the terms and the science.
What is late-term abortion and what does federal law allow?
Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, said that abortion should be allowed until the time a fetus could survive outside the womb, a point (known as viability) that medical science generally considers to be at about 24 weeks of pregnancy. The Court has also specified that abortion should be legal after viability in certain cases -- if continuing the pregnancy would seriously threaten the woman's life or health.
Late-term abortion is a phrase used by abortion opponents to refer to abortions performed after about 21 weeks of pregnancy. It is not the same as the medical definition obstetricians use for "late-term," which refers to pregnancies that extend past a woman's due date, meaning about 41 or 42 weeks. Contrary to Mr. Trump's claim, late-term abortions do not allow "a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth."
How common is it?
Very rare. The most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that about 1.3 percent of abortions performed in the United States in 2015 occurred in or after the 21st week of pregnancy. Abortions after 24 weeks comprise less than one percent of all abortions. When they occur, it is usually because the fetus has been found to have a fatal condition that could not be detected earlier, such as a severe malformation of the brain, or because the mother's life or health is at serious risk.
Can fetuses feel pain?
This is a complex issue. Most scientists who have examined the question say fetuses do not develop the neurological wiring that would give them the ability to feel pain until at least 24 weeks -- in other words after nearly all abortions occur.
An analysis of research in this area published in JAMA in 2005 found that pain sensation requires neural connections into the cortex, and the cortex is not functionally developed until the 26th week or later.
In 2010, a panel appointed by Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, published another large review of the research concluding that "most neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception" so "the fetus cannot experience pain in any sense prior" to 24 weeks.
What do state laws say about late-term abortion?
State laws vary. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, 43 states ban some abortions after a certain point in pregnancy.
What does the new New York law allow?
New York's Reproductive Health Act was passed to make sure the state would continue to ensure the right to an abortion if the Supreme Court were to overturn all or part of Roe v. Wade. Some lawmakers in New York's Democratic-controlled legislature said they were concerned that President Trump's appointments of two conservative justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, might put federal abortion protections at risk.
The new state law says a health provider may perform an abortion in the state before 24 weeks -- and later if the fetus is not considered viable or if the procedure is considered necessary to protect the woman's life or health. Those are all similar to stipulations made by the Supreme Court.
In an opinion piece in The New York Times on Wednesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, sharply disputed Mr. Trump's characterization of the law. "Contrary to what its detractors claim, the Reproductive Health Act does not allow abortions minutes before birth, nor does it allow third-trimester abortions 'for any reason,"' Mr. Cuomo wrote.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Warren can't shake off question of her identity

Texto completo: Newly disclosed form shows her claiming Native American heritage
Elizabeth Warren was a law professor at the University of Texas when she filled out a form from the state bar that asked her to list her race. Her answer, printed in careful block letters: "American Indian."
Thirty-three years later - and days before the official launch of her presidential run - that newly disclosed document has emerged as a political flash point, forcing Warren to reckon with a question that has been dogging her for years and that she has never put to rest: why, through much of her life and legal career, she claimed to be Native American despite being white.
By Wednesday, after the bar registration card was published by The Washington Post, Warren faced new doubts about her viability in the presidential race, as activists and strategists evaluated how much damage the issue might do - especially given Democrats' focus on finding a candidate who can defeat President Trump - and what she might do to move past it.
Liberal activists have long described cultural appropriation as hurtful, since someone is assuming the identity of a group without having faced the suffering or discrimination that group endured. The question is whether Democratic primary voters will punish Warren for actions for which she has apologized.
"This was about 30 years ago," said Warren, when asked Wednesday why she filled out the bar form. She explained that as a girl in Oklahoma she'd learned stories about her family history from her parents and siblings, leading her to believe the family was Native American. "But that said, there really is an important distinction of tribal citizenship,"
For Democrats, the issue was long eclipsed by anger at Trump's ridicule of Warren, especially his use of the nickname "Pocahontas." But Warren's presidential run, coming as she has struggled to explain her past claims of Native American identity, has prompted some Democrats to take a harder look at her own actions.
The matter now threatens to overshadow the image Warren has sought to foster of a truth- telling consumer advocate who would campaign for the White House as a champion for the working class. Instead, she is now seeking to combat the portrait of someone who for years was insufficiently sensitive to a long- oppressed minority. The matter also is arising at a time when issues of racial and cultural identity are increasingly sensitive in the Democratic Party.
Adding to Warren's troubles are her fumbling efforts in recent months to get ahead of the issue. Many activists complained when she released the results of a DNA test showing she had a distant ancestor who was Native American. Warren apologized by phone last week to Bill John Baker, principal chief of the Cherokee tribe, though members of the tribe had mixed reactions.
"I'm not a member of a tribe," she told reporters Wednesday. "I have apologized for not being more sensitive to that distinction."
Republicans have sought to take advantage. Trump last week told the New York Times, "I do think Elizabeth Warren's been hurt very badly with the Pocahontas trap," noting that the controversy had undermined her credibility.
The Republican National Committee on Wednesday filed a grievance with the State Bar of Texas asking for "disciplinary action" against Warren for "lying and failing to correct a misrepresentation."
The more immediate problem Warren faces is within her own party.
"To claim native identity - clearly it wasn't the appropriate thing to do," said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a group focused on electing women of color. "Was she trying to indicate her solidarity with the group? Why was it like that for her in the 1980s? I think she has more to say on that."
There's a long history in America of people making unsubstantiated claims to Native American heritage, a practice objected to strongly by tribal members as diluting their culture and shared experience.
"Everyone who cares about us as natives are welcome, but at critical moments those who have legal and cultural standing have a unique place with specific rights and responsibilities," Chuck Hoskin Jr., secretary of state for the Cherokee Nation, wrote last week in the Tulsa World. "That is why it offends us when some of our national leaders seek to ascribe inappropriately membership or citizenship to themselves."
The first known instance of Warren being identified as having Native American ancestry was in 1984, when her name appeared in a cookbook called "Pow Wow Chow," compiled by a cousin to be sold at a fundraiser.
Warren listed herself as a "minority" in the Association of American Law Schools directory starting in 1986, and presented herself that way in the directory for nine years. That same year, she filled out the bar card, which The Post obtained via an open- records request to the State Bar of Texas.
There's no indication that Warren gained professionally by reporting herself as Native American on the card. Above the lines for race, national origin and handicap status, the card says, "The following information is for statistical purposes only and will not be disclosed to any person or organization without the express written consent of the attorney."
The AALS directories were used by law schools when searching for new professors, prompting some Republicans to charge that she was claiming Native identity to get ahead.
Warren moved from the University of Texas to the University of Pennsylvania in 1987. After she worked at Penn for about two years, the university changed her recorded race from white to Native American, school records show. Warren has told the Boston Globe that she requested the change, saying it was important for her to reflect what she believed to be her family heritage.
Several months after Warren started working at Harvard Law School in late 1995, Harvard recorded her ethnicity as Native American, according to university records reported by the Globe. The records include a memo showing that Warren signed off on the change.
Harvard continued reporting Warren as a Native American until 2004, the records show. Warren has never explained what happened that year to prompt the change.
Warren declined to say Wednesday whether there might be other documents that could surface in which she identified herself as Native American.
"All I know is during this time period, this is consistent with what I did because it was based on my understanding from my family stories," Warren said. "But family stories are not the same as tribal citizens, and that is why I have apologized."
Warren has previously acknowledged that she claimed Cherokee and Delaware heritage despite having only a distant ancestor who was Native American. But the Texas bar registration card provides the first visual evidence that she, rather than a staffer or other associate, claimed that ethnicity in a formal, professional context.
As she prepared for a seven-state presidential announcement blitz, it was not clear that Warren had a significant plan to confront the issue beyond continuing to apologize.
"There is no visible strategy for this," said Joel Benenson, a leading Democratic pollster who advised the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. "When you're in the eye of the storm, you don't want things to drip, drip, drip."
He added, "There is probably time for them to develop a better, more coherent and powerful story to deal with this. But they have to do it in short order."
Warren, referring to her recent apology to the Cherokee chief, said it was deeply felt.
"This is from the heart," she said. "This is about my family, my brothers, and it is about an apology from the heart, and apology for not being more sensitive to tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty and for harm caused."
Warren's apology has been met with mixed reactions. "This closes the matter," tweeted Keith Harper, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council. "Onward."
But not all were pleased.
"I want to see it in writing," said David Cornsilk, a historian and genealogist who is also a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. "I want her to go on national TV. I want her to do a video like she did to announce her DNA results. It just seemed very lacking."
Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), one of two Native American women serving in Congress, said she did not fault Warren.
"I've lived my whole life with people self-identifying as Native American. I never questioned their identity," said Haaland in an interview. "It's not up to me." She called Warren "a tremendous ally for Native Americans."
For Warren, putting this chapter behind her is key to calming the nerves of Democrats who want a nominee who can present a strong challenge to Trump.

Texto completo: C.Y. Lee
NEW YORK - C.Y. Lee, whose novel "The Flower Drum Song" became a best seller and the basis for a popular stage musical and Oscar-nominated film despite mixed critical reactions and concerns about stereotypes, has died at age 102.
Lee's son, Jay Lee, told The Associated Press that his father died Nov. 8 in Los Angeles. The family decided at the time not to make his death public.
"The Flower Drum Song," a story of generational conflict set in San Francisco's Chinatown, came out in 1957, and quickly became a popular read. The New York Times' Idwal Jones praised Lee's "objective eye," but also faulted the book for its absence of "deeper notes" and its affinity for "slang and sex" and "popular taste." (The author would later acknowledge he wanted to reach a large audience).
Anne Boyle
OMAHA, Neb. - Anne Boyle, a longtime Nebraska Public Service Commissioner who also led the state Democratic Party for several years, has died at age 75.
The Omaha World-Herald reported that Anne Boyle died Saturday after suffering a stroke on Monday. She had been in hospice care since the stroke.

Bill T. Jones connects three disparate lives in his 'Analogy' trilogy

Texto completo: Bill T. Jones has never wanted for ambition. Formed in 1982, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company addressed racism, gender politics, and dance as a performance art that's not necessarily silent. Zane died in 1988, but Jones has since become a MacArthur Fellow, a Kennedy Center honoree, a two-time Tony Award winner, and the artistic director of New York Live Arts. And the company has continued on in works like “Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land" (1990), “Still/Here" (1994), and “Story/Time" (2012). On Feb. 14-17, the Institute of Contemporary Art will present Jones's “Analogy" trilogy (2015–2017), a meditation on meaning and memory that incorporates text, music, movement, and video.
“Analogy/Dora: Tramontane" (Feb. 14) focuses on Jones's mother-in-law, Dora Amelan, who was a nurse and social worker in Vichy France during World War II. “Analogy/Lance: Pretty aka The Escape Artist" (Feb. 15) looks at the life of Jones's nephew, Lance T. Briggs, a model, performer, and drug addict. (Jones brought a related work, “Letter to My Nephew," to the ICA when he was last here, in November 2016.) And “Analogy/Ambros: The Emigrant" (Feb. 16-17) was inspired by the novels of 20th-century German writer W.G. Sebald, specifically the segment of “The Emigrants" in which the narrator's great-uncle, Ambros Adelwarth, becomes the traveling companion of American aviator Cosmo Solomon before giving way to depression and dying in a mental institution. Jones spoke to the Globe about the origins of his trilogy and what “Analogy" means to him.
Q. Did “Analogy" start out to be a trilogy?
A. Well, I had been reading a lot of wonderful literature about 13 or 14 years ago, and I was directed toward W.G. Sebald's series of books. “The Emigrants" was maybe one of the first I read, and I was much struck with it, particularly the story of Ambros Adelwarth, because I'm a fan of this sort of historical fiction rooted in strong characters. It felt very real for me as a person in middle age trying to be truthful and wondering about the nature of truth. Sebald used his history in such a way that at times you wonder what is fiction and what is fact. So it started with Ambros Adelwarth.
Q. But “Analogy" begins with Dora.
A. Yes, around the same time, I was reviewing an oral history with Dora Amelan I had done as a gift to my husband [Bjorn Amelan, the company's creative director]. She was 19 years old when the Nazis marched into Antwerp. She and her sisters escaped, and she became involved with a Jewish organization, one part of which was underground. She began to work at one of these holding camps the Vichy government set up with the Germans, and she has a very powerful story to tell about what it means to be a young Jewish woman trying to understand who she was and what was a meaningful life when the whole world was crazy.
And I was trying to do both Dora and Sebald — he has a natural affinity for the time period, the European point of view. But they are so rich that I realized I should deal with one at a time. Dora Amelan was visiting us twice a year, the stories were continuing to pour out of her, and I felt quite privileged to be sitting across from a piece of history that was someone I loved. So we began with Dora first, putting Ambros on the back burner.
Q. And after that?
A. The next one seemed to be staring me in the face, my young nephew, Lance T. Briggs. I keep calling him my “young" nephew — he's a man who's almost 50 years old now, but in my mind he's still the vivacious and troubled 18-year-old that I had known years ago, and he was washed up on a far shore of life, having had this exciting life as a model, a dancer, and then addiction to crack cocaine, and a sex worker. And we were talking once a week, and he told me that he wanted to tell the absolute truth about his life, that he had lived this shadow life since he was quite a young boy. And therefore he was the second one in the trilogy.
Q. Does “Analogy" represent a new direction in dance, or is it just a different performance genre?
A. Well, my work has always been multidisciplinary, if that's what you mean. On one level it's trying to deepen something that I've been interested in a long time in how text, movement, song, décor are all greater than the sum of their parts, and this work is a meditation on all of those things. I think I've never made anything quite like it, and quite frankly I haven't seen anything quite like it.
Q. What kind of challenge was this for the dancers?
A. I told Nick Hallett [the trilogy's composer] that I really wanted my company to sing. And he was a bit skeptical; he's a professional singer, and he didn't think that these dancers had the ear. And it's true, it's been a struggle getting people who are not thinking about pitch to actually understand pitch, and to understand text. These people had already been indoctrinated into a system that would have them pick up the microphone and then speak the language of an 85-year-old French-Jewish woman. So they had to learn about her phrasing, her imagery. They had to channel Lance T. Briggs, a young inner-city man who was their age somewhere in the late '80s, the '90s.
And then they had to learn about Ambros Adelwarth and my love for literature. They had to learn what it was about this novel that inspired me to try to make a performance out of it. The first cast — it's now 50 percent changed, but the first cast was required to read the novel. I find it a very interesting and tasty reading, but for many of them it was just flowery language. They're not very much interested in literary metaphors or poetic allusions, not to mention the historical references that Sebald is such a master of. But they had to do it for the sake of the choreography.
Q. And finally, what is the “Analogy" of the title?
A. It's analogy about a comparison. But I don't tell the audience what is being compared. If they see all three pieces, I think it becomes ever more clear what is actually the subject of the piece. I sometimes say “Analogy" is about the nature of a life, or what is a life well lived, or what is a meaningful life. I don't tell you what I think, but I give you an opportunity to look at how I've drawn the portraits, and that tells you something about what I think about these three lives, and therefore justifies their being compared. I would encourage people to try to see all three sections of the piece if they could. I think it will be quite rewarding.

Opposing war doesn't equal Putin's stooge

Texto completo: PARIS - Apparently it's now necessary for American political candidates to advocate endless interventionist wars, lest they end up accused of being a useful idiot for the Kremlin.
The fact that Russian leadership happens to share a position on something doesn't mean that the position is invalid. If we learn tomorrow that Vladimir Putin likes Diet Coke, some people will see it as proof that Donald Trump is a Kremlin puppet. It is indeed possible for two different leaders to show a preference for the same thing - such as not being bogged down in fruitless wars - but for different reasons.
And now it has come to this: A war veteran announcing her candidacy for president of the United States has been attacked by NBC News because she has a point of view that also happens to be held by the Russian president.
Tulsi Gabbard, 37, a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, spent a year serving with a Hawaii National Guard field medical unit in a combat zone in Iraq - a mission for which she volunteered. After graduating with honors from the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy, Gabbard deployed again to Kuwait as a military police officer, and she continues to serve as a major in the National Guard.
On Saturday, Gabbard officially declared her candidacy for president. At her campaign kickoff event, she talked about ending the exploitation of American troops by politicians bent on regime change.
"We must stand up ... against powerful politicians from both parties who sit in ivory towers thinking up new wars to wage, new places for people to die," Gabbard said. "These powerful politicians dishonor the sacrifices made by every one of my brothers and sisters in uniform, their families - they are the ones who pay the price for these wars."
On Friday, NBC News had posted a story about how experts who track Russian websites and social media accounts linked to the Kremlin are seeing "the first stirrings of an upcoming Russian campaign of support for Gabbard."
NBC News analyst Alex Stamos is quoted in the story, saying that Gabbard's "promulgation of positions compatible with Russian geo strategic interests can help them mainstream such discussion in the (Democratic) party."
Gabbard lashed out at the NBC story Sunday, citing a report by noted journalist Glen Greenwald that the only source NBC used was a firm that just got caught by The New York Times fabricating Russian troll accounts for the Democratic Party in the Alabama Senate race.
To reduce Gabbard to some kind of Russian stooge, as NBC did, would mean buying into the idea that it's implausible for someone who has seen war close up to want to avoid it if other alternatives exist.
"Gabbard's most controversial position and the one where she's most in line with Russian interests is on Syria," wrote NBC News reporters Robert Windrem and Ben Popken. "She's accused the U.S. of pushing a policy of 'regime change' wars and in January 2017, she met with Syrian President Bashar (Assad) in Syria on what she called a 'fact-finding mission.' "
Gabbard strikes a chord that transcends the ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans - at least for those who aren't beholden to special interests. Politicians from both parties unite on little except for the call to intervene militarily in foreign countries. They might cite different reasons - the left prefers "humanitarian intervention" while the right peddles fear (usually of terrorism) - but the addiction to foreign meddling is a shared one.
With her military background, Gabbard understands that American troops have been abused and misused to serve the agendas of soft-handed establishment politicians for whom the realities of war are little more than an abstraction. It's an insult to independent-minded Americans to suggest that anyone who aligns with her thinking is nothing more than a pawn of Putin.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump announced on Tuesday that he will sit down with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, at the end of this month in Vietnam, a country chosen as a neutral location for their second nuclear summit meeting, but one that also has plenty of symbolic significance.
Mr. Trump hopes the meeting will jump-start a diplomatic effort that has stalled since their first encounter, last June in Singapore. While North Korea since then has refrained from overtly provocative actions like testing nuclear warheads or ballistic missiles, it has yet to agree to actually give up any piece of its atomic arsenal.
"If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea," Mr. Trump said in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. "Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong-un is a good one. Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam."
Mr. Trump disclosed the location in an interview last week with The New York Times, but aides asked that it not be immediately reported, citing security concerns.
[How Vietnam offers a model for North Korea's relations with the United States.]
Mr. Trump visited Danang, Vietnam, for the first time in 2017 when he attended an annual summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. As the site for his upcoming meeting with Mr. Kim, Vietnam offers a couple of possible allegorical lessons: On the one hand, it was the setting of the United States' last major war in the region, a reminder of the devastating costs of conflict. On the other, it represents how a Communist regime can emerge from international isolation and build a thriving economy.
The forthcoming meeting is fraught for Mr. Trump, who has made a possible agreement with North Korea one of the signature goals of his foreign policy. After Singapore, he claimed prematurely that the North Korean nuclear dispute was "largely solved." He regularly boasts of his close relationship with Mr. Kim -- "we fell in love," he once said -- and regales visitors about the friendly letters he has received from the North Korean dictator.
As evidence of their rapprochement, Mr. Trump regularly notes that North Korea released three American prisoners and sent back what were believed to be the remains of 55 American soldiers who died in the Korean War.
But many experts have said North Korea is simply stringing Mr. Trump along, taking advantage of his inexperience and his desire for a breakthrough. His own intelligence chiefs told Congress last week that North Korea is "unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capability," as Mr. Trump has been seeking.
"That's what the intelligence chief thinks, and I think there's a good possibility of that, too," Mr. Trump said in an interview broadcast over the weekend on "Face the Nation" on CBS. "But there's also a very good chance that we will make a deal. I think he's also tired of going through what he's going through. He has a chance to have North Korea be a tremendous economic behemoth. It has a chance to be one of the great economic countries in the world."
He added that his personal connection with Mr. Kim might pay off.
"I like him. I get along with him great. We have a fantastic chemistry," the president said. "We have had tremendous correspondence that some people have seen and can't even believe it. They think it's historic. And we'll see what happens. Now that doesn't mean we're going to make a deal. But certainly I think we have a very good chance of making a deal."

Texto completo: The Associated Press
NEW YORK - After nearly three months of testimony about a vast drug-smuggling conspiracy steeped in violence, a jury began deliberations Monday at the U.S. trial of the infamous Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.
The day ended without jurors reaching a verdict for Guzman, who faces life in prison if convicted. They were to resume deliberations this morning.
The jury has heard months of testimony about Guzman's rise to power as the head of the Sinaloa cartel. Prosecutors say he is responsible for smuggling at least 200 tons of cocaine into the United States and for a wave of killings in turf wars with other cartels.
Guzman, 61, is notorious for escaping from prison twice in Mexico. In closing arguments, prosecutor Andrea Goldbarg said he was plotting yet another breakout when was he was sent in 2017 to the U.S., where he has been in solitary confinement ever since.
The defendant wanted to escape "because he is guilty and he never wanted to be in a position where he would have to answer for his crimes," Goldbarg told the jury. "He wanted to avoid sitting right there. In front of you."
The defense claims Guzman's role has been exaggerated by cooperating witnesses who are seeking leniency in their own cases. In his closing, defense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman assailed the case as a "fantasy" and urged the jury not to believe cooperators who "lie, steal, cheat, deal drugs and kill people" for a living.
Last week, newly unsealed court papers revealed disturbing allegations not heard by the jury - that Guzman had sex with girls as young as 13. A Colombian drug trafficker told investigators that the kingpin paid $5,000 to have the girls brought to him, and that he sometimes drugged them, the papers say.
The start of the proceedings Monday was briefly delayed after two jurors indicated to the judge they were aware of reports about the alleged sex crimes. He questioned both behind closed doors before allowing them to remain on the jury.
The unsealing of the documents came at the request of The New York Times and Vice News. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan had ordered prosecutors to review the material - originally sealed because it was deemed unrelated to the drug charges - and make portions of it public within four days of the government resting its case against Guzman.
Guzman's attorneys said their client denies the allegations.
Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, on a visit to New York City, stopped by the courtroom, with the jury not present, to thank the government's trial team.

U.S. News: Democrats Take Aim at Stock Buybacks

Texto completo: At least five declared or likely Democratic presidential candidates want to restrict how much stock U.S. companies can buy back from shareholders, raising the chance a common tool used by public companies and relied on by investors could become an election issue.
The campaign against buybacks by liberal Democrats -- including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats -- comes as the nation's largest companies have repurchased shares at a record pace that analysts attribute in part to the tax law passed by Congress in 2017.
Democrats argue that buybacks enrich executives and shareholders at the expense of workers and long-term economic growth. Investors generally oppose legislation that would restrict corporate investing decisions, but Wall Street is divided over the impact buybacks have on the broader U.S. economy.
In a buyback, a company uses its cash to repurchase existing shares, reducing its share count and as a result typically increasing the stock price.
The practice has drawn criticism from those who contend buybacks amount to financial engineering to boost share prices and executive bonuses; others say the practice shortchanges the economy by directing back into the stock market funds that could have gone directly to workers. Proponents of share buybacks argue that they can unlock unused cash for investing elsewhere.
The latest salvo came in a Sunday op-ed in the New York Times by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Mr. Sanders of Vermont. The two plan to propose legislation that would force public companies to provide higher wages and more robust benefits for workers as a condition for launching buyback plans.
"The goal is to curtail the overreliance on buybacks while also incentivizing the productive investment of corporate capital," Messrs. Schumer and Sanders wrote.
The plan is unlikely to become law soon, with Republicans opposed to restricting buybacks in control of the Senate and White House.
Some studies show that research, development and other capital expenditures are unaffected at companies that offer buybacks. An August study by MSCI Inc., the world's largest index provider, "did not find evidence that companies might be diverting resources to buybacks instead of reinvesting in their companies."
"Buybacks do create value," said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive of Adams Funds. "It may not be the value everyone wants, but it does create value for shareholders."
Firms that buy back their own stock have tended to outperform the broader stock market, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. So far this year, Goldman's so-called buyback basket -- including significant repurchases by Apple Inc., Boeing Co. and Best Buy Co. -- has risen 9.2% through Jan. 28, compared with a 6.4% gain for the S&P 500.
U.S. corporate buyback spending is projected to hit a record $940 billion for 2019, exceeding the $770 billion spent in 2018 and the previous high of $588 billion in 2015, according to Goldman Sachs. Qualcomm Inc., for instance, spent $21.2 billion on share repurchases in the third quarter, more than any other S&P 500 company, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The jump has given Democrats an opening to argue that repurchases are largely benefiting corporate executives and large shareholders rather than workers and the broader economy.
Democrats have also called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to change its rules governing how company executives can benefit from repurchasing programs.
House Democrats also plan to use their new majority to scrutinize stock buybacks, according to a House Democratic aide.

Texto completo: A new scripted show on BET reimagines the behind-the-scenes work that went into "Soul Train." And after a dramatic buildup, President Trump delivers his second State of the Union address.
What's on TV
AMERICAN SOUL 9 p.m. on BET. Set in 1970s Los Angeles against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, this new drama series chronicles the making of the first national program of its kind: "Soul Train," a response to "American Bandstand" written, produced and owned by black people. Sinqua Walls ("Power") portrays Don Cornelius, the creator and host of the show, alongside the actors Kelly Price and Jason Dirden. Among the guest stars are Wayne Brady, Bobby Brown and some former members of Destiny's Child, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. "American Soul" debuts with two back-to-back episodes in which Don goes out of his way to secure a star performer who will take his project to the next level. In an interview with The New York Times, Rowland -- who appeared on the show in 1998 -- talked about her role as Gladys Knight and what the series meant to her growing up. "'Soul Train' was one of my first memories of watching all these different beautiful black people dancing and having a good time," she said.
STATE OF THE UNION 9 p.m. on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and various cable news stations. The 2019 State of the Union address has finally arrived. The annual tradition was delayed when Speaker Nancy Pelosi told President Trump that she would not host him in the House until the government reopened, leading to a tit-for-tat that was resolved last week, after the 35-day government shutdown ended. While talks surrounding a border wall have dominated the news out of Washington lately, Trump is expected to discuss several other topics and make a call for bipartisanship. The speech will be followed by the Democrats' official response, to be delivered by Stacey Abrams.
What's Streaming
RAY ROMANO: RIGHT HERE, AROUND THE CORNER (2019) on Netflix. Ray Romano puts on surprise performances at the Comedy Cellar and the nearby Village Underground in New York in this new stand-up special. Judging from his material, the actor with the instantly recognizable nasal voice is not unlike his character in "Everybody Loves Raymond": a man who never feels like he is doing enough to please his wife. Romano currently stars in Epix's television adaptation of "Get Shorty," and will make a second Netflix appearance when the drama "Paddleton" debuts on Feb. 22.
THELMA & LOUISE (1991) stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon play best friends who set out on a weekend fishing trip and wind up becoming gun-toting fugitives in this classic road movie. For Thelma (Davis), the vacation is a much-needed getaway from her controlling husband (Christopher McDonald) that turns into a wild escape after an altercation at a bar parking lot. The movie balances its wild adventures and violence with a profound, feminist message that seems relevant now more than ever.

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren's office announced Monday that she has invited a federal employee who was out of work during the government shutdown to be her guest for Tuesday's State of the Union address.
Sajid Shahriar, who is based in Massachusetts and works for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was furloughed for the length of the 35-day shutdown, according to a news release.
Shahriar also is executive vice president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3258 and AFGE Vice President for the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, Warren's office said.
“It's time to send a message to President Trump and Senate Republicans: federal and contract workers are the backbone of our economy and their livelihoods should never be used as pawns in Republican political games," Warren said in the release.

Texto completo: Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here .
Greetings, I'm Li Yuan, your Asia tech columnist. I'm writing to you from balmy Hong Kong as the Chinese are getting ready to celebrate the Lunar New Year next week and China's tech community is bracing for a very tough Year of the Pig amid a slowing economy and a persistent trade war between the United States and China.
I'm old enough to remember that the Chinese New Year's Eve dinner was the meal of the year in the 1970s and 1980s because every family would try their best to put multiple meat dishes on the table. Almost every mainland resident of China was poor then and we had to use ration books to buy food, meat and cooking oil.
I'm also old enough to remember that the world was divided into the Eastern Bloc (the former Soviet Union and its satellite states) and the Western Bloc (the United States and its allies). China was close to the Eastern Bloc until it had a fallout with the Soviet Union. It was poor, isolated and ruled by a ruthless leader called Mao Zedong.
Things changed dramatically the year I was born, when Henry Kissinger secretly visited Beijing. In the following five decades, U.S.-China relations had its ups and downs but it should be fair to say that the two countries benefited tremendously from opening to each other: China from accessing the American technology, capital and market while the United States benefited from China's cheap and hard-working labor and later its vast market.
Relations have soured since China has become increasingly authoritarian under President Xi Jinping and the United States increasingly isolationist under President Trump. The two countries have been engaged in a trade war since summer 2018. But Monday felt like a watershed moment as the Justice Department unveiled sweeping charges against the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. A tech Cold War seems irreversible, and much of the world has to choose a side: China or the United States?
"The Americans are not going to surrender global technological supremacy without a fight, and the indictment of Huawei is the opening shot in that struggle," Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration, told my colleagues.
At the core of the fight is a technology called the fifth generation, or 5G, mobile network that is expected to remake the plumbing that controls the internet. Huawei is a global leader in the technology. For the U.S. government, that poses serious security risks.
As detailed in an excellent tale by my colleagues from the United States, Europe and China, over the past year the United States embarked on a global campaign to push its allies to bar Huawei's 5G build-out.
One thing in the article that really struck me is that some countries have questioned whether America's campaign is really about national security or if it is aimed at preventing China from gaining a competitive edge. "Administration officials see little distinction in those goals," my colleagues wrote.
In the eyes of lawmakers and intelligence officials in the United States, the Chinese government's tightening grip on its companies makes it impossible to distinguish whether a firm like Huawei is a business entity or an agent of the Chinese government because no company could choose whether to cooperate with Beijing or not.
This is what I call the Chinese curse for Chinese companies. Huawei may have done many wrong things, including stealing trade secrets and violating sanctions, but that won't change the fact that its employees, scientists and executives had put a lot of blood and sweat to grow it from a tiny maker of telecom equipment to a global giant. Huawei exemplifies how the Chinese lifted themselves out of poverty and became a technological power through perseverance.
But because China has an authoritarian government that believes the Communist Party should control everything and everything in the country should serve the interest of the party, it is nearly unimaginable that any Chinese company can say no to government requests, especially if they are made repeatedly and in the name of national security.
Some readers must already be screaming that just like Huawei, China developed its technologies by stealing intellectual properties and forcing foreign companies to share their knowledge in exchange for market access. Yes, China has committed many wrongdoings and needs to admit and correct its mistakes in order to set forth on the right path in the future. And the world needs to become more alert to the threat of China's techno-authoritarianism (see the link to the George Soros speech below). Still, I can't help but reserve some sympathies for the Chinese who are caught in the middle of the fight.
The relationship between the United States and China can't go back to what it had been in the last 40 years. Even if the trade war is resolved with China promising to buy a lot of American products, the Huawei problem and the tech war aren't going away.
It's the struggle for global supremacy. Neither side is going to back off easily. Some 170 nations will have to choose to either let go of Huawei, thus crossing Beijing, or lose the support of Washington by staying with Huawei.
Here are a few things worth reading if you haven't:
■ This is a little dated, but very relevant to the whole Huawei saga. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the billionaire investor George Soros labeled President Xi the world's "most dangerous opponent of open societies," warning of the "mortal danger" in China's use of artificial intelligence to repress its people.
■ My colleague Jack Nicas used the story of a tiny screw to illustrate why Apple is unlikely to bring its manufacturing closer to home and why the economic decoupling of the United States and China will be tough and painful.
■ Even Foxconn, Apple's biggest contract manufacturer in China, initially seemed to bow to the difficult economics of manufacturing in the United States. A top official of the company said on Wednesday that it was reassessing its plans to build a $10 billion Wisconsin plant to make flat-screen television and create 13,000 jobs. But on Friday, after a conversation between the company's chairman and President Trump, the company said it was committed to building the factory.
■ The residents of Tonga, a remote island nation 1,100 miles northeast of New Zealand, lost high-speed internet after an underwater fiber-optic cable was severed on Jan. 20. Daniel Victor talked to residents about how they survived the digital darkness.
■ Geoffrey A. Fowler of The Washington Post wrote an excellent column about the ethical questions we should be asking ourselves as video doorbells and connected security cameras have become the fastest-growing smart home tech. Here's one piece of advice. "Facial recognition isn't a product feature: It's a superpower."

Texto completo: Most football players can only dream of making the Super Bowl, especially in just their second NFL season.
But Davis grad Cooper Kupp's experience when his team takes the field this Sunday in Atlanta won't be what anyone envisions when they set their sights on the game's ultimate prize. Instead of catching passes to lead the Los Angeles Rams to victory, Kupp will be relegated to the sideline due to the season-ending knee injury he suffered against Seattle on Nov. 11.
"It's really been difficult," Jake Kupp, Cooper's grandfather, said in a phone interview Wednesday. "Just thinking about what Cooper's going through, understanding that he's watched as a spectator as opposed to being down in the trenches with his team."
Cooper Kupp's teammates clearly haven't forgotten about him and he's stayed with them to celebrate their success. Wide receiver Robert Woods called Kupp's injury a "tough loss" according to NFL.com and told the New York Times, "We've got to get him a ring."
Kupp held team-highs of 28 catches and five touchdowns before tweaking his left knee for the first time against Denver in Week 6, which caused him to miss the next two games. Quarterback Jared Goff completed 68.4 percent of his passes for a passer rating of 113 in his first ten games, compared to just 59.8 percent and a rating of 83.9 in the final six games without the former Eastern Washington All-American.
Kupp's father Craig said he and his wife haven't gone to any games since their son's first serious injury of his football career. But they still watch the games on television and appreciate when announcers highlight Cooper's contributions while pointing out the significance of his absence.
"That's neat to hear," Craig Kupp said. "It's always reassuring and all that stuff. It doesn't replace him out there."
Cooper chose to turn down all media requests leading up to the Super Bowl to keep the focus on the team while he remains dedicated to his rehabilitation, which Jake said is ahead of schedule. A 13-second video with the caption "Small wins lead to big victories!" appeared on Coopser's Instagram on Wednesday afternoon and he spoke with Sam Farmer of the LA Times on Thursday.
"The only thing that would come out of this would be about me, or a distraction if I were to slip up," Kupp told The Times. "That's the last thing I'd ever want to do."
He received more support from Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen, who Craig said reached out to Cooper to offer some encouragement and advice around the same time Dr. Neal ElAttrache performed surgery to repair a torn ACL. Allen recovered from the same injury to win NFL Comeback Player of the Year after setting career-highs in 2017, and Craig said doctors told his son he could also come back even stronger and more explosive.
"It's been tough as you would expect," Craig Kupp said. "But at the same time he's really focused right now on his recovery and doing all that he can to get back better than he was before."
Cooper's wife and her family still plan to go to Atlanta and watch the Rams take on the Patriots Sunday. The Kupp family chose to stay behind and plans to go to the Super Bowl when LA returns with Cooper healthy and playing.
Of course, Craig understands better than most that's no guarantee, since neither he nor Jake ever got particularly close to the big game during their NFL careers. Like Cooper, Jake Kupp also missed most of a season due to a knee injury during an accomplished eight-year stint with the Saints, but he knows the Rams' success adds another level of disappointment alongside the thrill of watching teammates play for a ring.
"This wasn't exactly how I imagined my first one playing out," Kupp told The Times. "So in that regard it is tough. ... But at the same time, I've loved being able to contribute when I can. Being able to be around these guys, being able to sit in on meetings, and continue to feel like I can be a part of this thing even though my role isn't the same as it was before, just helps so much to ease what is a pretty tough situation."

Here are two truths to help you build a successful career and future

Resumen: What makes companies like Coca-Cola and Merck endure? It’s a culture that stays restless. You need that same attitude to build your career.

Texto completo: Success is amazingly common. What's scarce is success that doesn’t fizzle to failure . . . or fade within several generations. You want to succeed sustainably.
If you're anxious to avoid short-term failure, there's a cautionary tale in the legendary lottery curse. Folks win, then the curse promptly transitions their lives into train wrecks.
In the early TV era of the 1950s, this reversal of fortune was epitomized by the popular show “The Millionaire,” in which a super “Richie” gave away a million dollars to normal folks who usually became miserable quickly.
Over time we have watched rock stars flame out on drugs. Or beautiful young women marry for money and become morose.
Examples of slower, but bigger fades dot America's corporate landscape, including failures like Sears Holdings recent bankruptcy. Sears was America’s pre-eminent retailer and sixth-largest stock 50 years ago.
Banking today: Free checking is harder to find, especially among credit unions
Jobs in America: Employers add booming 304,000 jobs in January, marking 100th straight month of employment gains
Of the top 10 stocks back then, only Exxon survives as a leader. The others are hugely smaller or gone. They were, in order of size: IBM, AT&T, General Motors, Eastman Kodak, Exxon, Sears, Texaco, Xerox, GE and Gulf Oil. Four largely disappeared.
Even super-sized success stories from 20 years ago can fade fast: America Online (1999’s 11th largest ), Lucent (#7) MCI World Com (#16) and Yahoo (#25). Other storied names can also collapse: Blockbuster, Digital Equipment, Helene Curtis, and Toys R Us.
Hence, you can’t count on your employer, even if you work for the government. My father-in-law hated working for Uncle Sam. Post-Great Depression he did it solely for security. But since 1990, the total civilian federal headcount has shrunk 12 percent (including enterprise workers like in the Postal Service). It keeps wiggling downward.
Yet some names endure, becoming near-permanent icons like Coca-Cola, DowDupont and Merck. What makes them different? Simply, it’s a culture that remains restless, striving to change, to be the best and to grow.
That’s your goal! To endlessly build your future.
For that you need two truths: First, make sure your employer is like that. And if they aren't, move to one that is. How hard is your employer really striving to grow? How much effort and money do they invest each year into truly new growth oriented initiatives?
My father asked, “What are you doing your competitors aren’t doing yet?” It was among the most brilliant lines I ever heard. It changed me. It speaks to putting yourself ahead of the curve or staying ahead. If your current employer isn’t seriously striving for future growth, you should shift to one that is before it’s too late.
The second truth: You must make yourself indispensable – which has two components. Once you’re done with college and working, you need to be permanently learning. You can do it informally online. But keep building your human capital. Google endlessly about anything and everything that touches, even peripherally, on what your firm does, and beyond the functions you perform there.
Then, at work, keep volunteering, for everything and anything. Raise your hand repeatedly. Make your boss and boss’s boss know you are not about what you “can do,” which is about your capacity, but what you “will do” which is above, beyond, and more than that sorry sap next to you. If your firm does shrink, you will be among the last 20 percent they let go, giving you time to maneuver to a more futuristic employer.
In our future, anyone who isn’t eager is meager. Great attitude and activity will always equal success. Complacency now equals eventual failure. Sustainable success is only yours to build.

When a poet shows he is jealous

Texto completo: Everyone loves poetry. In theory. Not that anyone actually wants their child to end up a poet.
In that sense, we — ever since I was an undergrad, I confess to occasionally publishing poems in little magazines with, as Calvin Trillin used to say, circulations in the high two figures — are like guitar players. Fine with parents if Junior wants to pluck a little. Just God forbid he should try to take it on the road.
But we continue to exalt poetry. To treat it as the best manmade thing in the world. As I wrote in “Poetry in Orbit,” a poem published in Gulf Stream Literary Magazine — a prose poem, as we dub it in the trade: “The coolest job is astronaut, right? Well, astronaut-poet. Every child’s dream. ‘Cause no one calls it astronautics in motion when someone has a fluid tennis swing. They call it poetry. In motion. As opposed to on the page no one reads. But poetry, still. Someone has to do the job.”
In recent decades, poetry has been called upon not just to be the best stuff ever but to take on its ancient task of bucking up a nation in times of despair. Good luck with that one, fellow poets. I’m not up to the task.
But one prominent poet, much-published in non-little magazines and a writing professor at the University of Florida, is up to the task of doing hatchet jobs on poets who are not very good ones, and that’s fine, a necessary tonic for the vast majority of poetry criticism, which often amounts to what’s known in the literary dodge as “logrolling”: writing only good reviews of peers who one runs into often at the hotel bars at our annual drinking conferences.
So The New York Times’ editors knew what they were about when they assigned William Logan to review last month “THE FLAME: Poems, Notebooks, Lyrics, Drawings,” a posthumous collection by the late songwriter, and, yes, poet Leonard Cohen.
Leonard Cohen was not a very good poet. But he was a great songwriter, and lyricist, and singer, who lived an extraordinary life.
Few — none, that I know of — great songwriters are also great poets. Bob Dylan is not even a good poet, nor is Joni Mitchell, nor … Ira Gershwin. But I don’t begrudge at all Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. That was for his words as sung, not as read. Just don’t bother to read his scribblings as such. Open any little mag if you want to read a good, even great, poem.
What Logan and many other Cohen-despising poet/critics are is jealous. Cohen, who started out as a poet, actually did very well at it, commercially. When his “Collected Poems, 1956-1968” came out, it sold 20,000 copies in just the summer of 1968, when it was published. Most poets don’t sell that many books in a lifetime. It was on my mother’s bookshelf. I remember one good line: something that was “as empty as the drawer where I used to keep my opium.” The poems were written when he was between 15 and 20. He got smart; saw that there was no real career in poetry as such — all poets have to teach, or, like Wallace Stevens, sell insurance, to keep body and soul together. He picked up a guitar instead, and that worked out fabulously.
But in his hatchet job, Logan pretends Cohen wasn’t any good at all: “He wasn’t much of a singer, either; but the gravelly renderings of his lyrics gradually attracted a mass audience that seemed more like a cult. … At any moment of the day, ‘Suzanne’ is probably playing in an elevator somewhere.” Unlike Logan’s poems. But not a good singer? That’s like saying Neil Young is not a “good” singer, or Dylan, for that matter. A generation left Broadway show tunes behind, for good reason. They covered “Hallelujah” to the point where it was overplayed. Because it is a really great song.

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – A funny thing is happening on the way to United States Sen. Kamala Harris’ coronation as the Democratic presidential nominee. Her long and controversial prosecutorial record as California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney is catching up to her. Progressives have noticed that Harris, now re-inventing herself as a criminal-justice reform champion, behaved in a decidedly non-reform-minded way when she had the power to effect change.
This criticism shows how far the pendulum has swung away from the law-and-order policies that had dominated politics for decades, even in our liberal state. For years, aspiring politicians from both parties vowed to be as tough as possible on crime. The apex of this frenzy came in the 1998 gubernatorial election, where the two candidates tried to out-tough each other. The winner, Democrat Gray Davis, even said publicly that Singapore, which executed drug dealers, offers “a good starting point” for law-enforcement issues.
In the 1990s, Harris was an assistant prosecutor in San Francisco and dated that city’s flamboyant mayor and former Assembly speaker, Willie Brown. She apparently embraced the conventional wisdom of the time. If one has grand political ambitions, one must cozy up to the police unions and take unyielding positions on crime and punishment. Crime rates had started their long and precipitous fall by then, but the fear of crime was still motivating voters.
In the ensuing years, Harris became a darling of the political left. As state attorney general, she prosecuted the undercover videographers who published videos allegedly showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the marketing of the body parts of aborted fetuses. She used her power to force a conservative nonprofit foundation to turn over its private donor lists. She ensured the death of a pension-reform ballot measure by giving it a biased title and summary that sounded like a union boss had drafted it.
In the meantime, many progressives — and even some conservatives — had begun to push back against a justice system that has tilted too far in the direction of the government. Sentences, even for relatively minor crimes, had become extreme. Prosecutors ladle on so many charges that innocent people sometimes plead guilty to avoid decades in prison.
Poor people accept unfavorable plea deals because they cannot afford bail, and are desperate to get back to their jobs and children. People wrongly accused of crimes languish in prison even when exculpatory evidence later emerges. Prosecutors use civil forfeiture to take the property of people who haven’t been convicted or even accused of a crime.
Harris now champions bail reform and even wrote a preachy campaign book about her love of justice, but, as a prosecutor, she didn’t show much concern for protecting the liberties of those on the receiving end of the justice system. Writing recently in The New York Times, law professor Lara Bazelon noted that Harris “fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors.”
As Reason magazine’s Ed Krayewski wrote, “During her time as San Francisco’s district attorney, Harris oversaw the city’s mismanaged crime lab. A San Francisco Superior Court judge ruled that the DA’s office ignored demands that it take responsibility for the lab’s failings, and that it violated defendants’ rights …” Furthermore as AG, “Harris challenged the release of a man who had been exonerated by the Innocence Project and had his conviction overturned.” Despite her recent revisionist history, many others have noted that Harris opposed a long list of proposed sentencing and criminal-justice proposals. At least she finally sees which way the wind is blowing.
In Orange County, Harris still is getting brickbats for her refusal to provide oversight as the county endured its snitch scandal. “The former attorney general’s efforts in Orange County were far from a profile in courage,” assistant public defender Scott Sanders told the OC Weekly recently. “Her unwillingness to stand up to dishonest law enforcement will be her lasting legacy here, and the criminal-justice system will continue to pay the price for years.”
Harris also promoted policies that ramped up the power of police and prosecutors to imprison more people, including an Orwellian anti-truancy campaign that finally is getting much-deserved scorn. The left-leaning Guardian recently reported on a video of Harris at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco in 2010, where she lightheartedly boasted about prosecuting the parents of truants and about using her “huge stick” as a prosecutor.
There now is widespread and encouraging criticism about her record from those on the left, who will have something to say about the Democratic candidate selected to face off against Donald Trump. I doubt this will be a teachable moment for liberals, who always champion new laws without considering that they always create new lawbreakers. It would be ironic, however, if Harris’ regressive prosecutorial record undermines her carefully constructed image as a “progressive prosecutor.”

Why are we demonizing white men?

Texto completo: Rush Limbaugh's December 2018 Limbaugh Letter has an article titled "Demonizing White Men." It highlights -- with actual quotations from people in the media, academia and the political and entertainment arenas -- the attack on white men as a class. You can decide whether these statements are decent, moral or even sensible. Should we support their visions?
Don Lemon, a CNN anchorman, said, "We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them."
Steven Clifford, former King Broadcasting CEO, said, "I will be leading a great movement to prohibit straight white males, who I believe supported Donald Trump by about 85 percent, from exercising the franchise (to vote), and I think that will save our democracy."
Teen Vogue wrote, "Not only is white male terrorism as dangerous as Islamic extremism, but our collective safety rests in rooting out the source of their radicalization."
Economist Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist, wrote a column titled "The Angry White Male Caucus," in which he explained, "Trumpism is all about the fear of losing traditional privilege."
There have been similar despicable statements made by academics. Stacey Patton, a Morgan State University professor: "There is nothing more dangerous in the United States than a white man who has expected to succeed and finds himself falling behind." Stony Brook University sociology professor Michael Kimmel explained, "White men's anger comes from the potent fusion of two sentiments: entitlement and a sense of victimization."
Then there's the political arena. Sen. Bernie Sanders: "There's no question that in Georgia and in Florida racism has reared its ugly head. And you have candidates who ran against (Andrew) Gillum and ran against Stacey Adams who were racist. ... And that is an outrage." Michael Avenatti, criticizing the GOP senators during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings: "These old white men still don't understand that assault victims and women deserve respect and to be heard." "What troubles me is ... they're all white men," commented former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm regarding GOP senators questioning Christine Blasey Ford at the Kavanaugh hearings. William Falk, editor-in-chief of The Week, said, "There's something odd about the overwhelming white maleness of Washington's current leadership."
Not to be outdone, entertainers have hopped on the demonizing-white-men bandwagon. Joy Behar, talking on ABC's "The View" about senators supporting Kavanaugh, said: "These white men -- old, by the way -- are not protecting women. They're protecting a man who is probably guilty." Actress Gabourey Sidibe, also on "The View," said: "Older white men are a problem, y'all, for everyone. We're all at risk." Moira Donegan wrote an article for The Guardian titled "Half of white women continue to vote Republican. What's wrong with them?" Renee Graham wrote a column in The Boston Globe that counseled, "Memo to black men: Stop voting Republican." Comedian Chelsea Handler tweeted, "Just a friendly reminder for the weekend: No white after Labor Day, and no old, white racist men after the midterms. Get out and vote."
That is just a partial list of statements that would be viewed and condemned as racist simply by replacing "white men" with "black men," "Mexican men" or "Asian men." You can bet the rent money that university presidents and media executives would sanction any of their employees for making similar broad, sweeping statements about nonwhite men. Suppose a white anchorman said, "Black people are the greatest murder threat in this country." I guarantee you that he'd be shown the door.
There are only two ways to explain the silence by people who should know better. Either they agree with the sentiments expressed or they are out-and-out cowards. Decent American people ought to soundly reject and condemn this brazen attack on white men. I think that the attack is on masculinity itself and that white men are a convenient scapegoat -- for now.

Nevada delegation bashes Rick Perry for secretly shipping weapons-grade plutonium into their state

Texto completo: Nevada Democrats took aim at Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Thursday for secretly trucking weapons-grade plutonium cross-country to Nevada last year, vowing to introduce legislation to block the Trump administration from making any future trips.

"Not only did Secretary Perry and the agencies under his direction act in bad faith by totally ignoring the will of our Governor, their decision also completely disregards the health and safety of Nevadans," said Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.

She was joined by Sen. Jacky Rosen and Rep. Dina Titus of Nevada in admonishing the agency as behaving illegally and unethically.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the agency in charge of nuclear safety, said it had no involvement in the Energy Department shipments.

Cortez Masto said she will be demanding answers at a meeting she quickly arranged with high-level officials from the Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration, which is in charge of the nuclear arsenal.

The senator also will be introducing legislation to block any future shipments, she said in a statement.

Cortez Masto said Perry had lied to a federal court by withholding information that the federal government had shipped plutonium from a nuclear weapons facility in South Carolina to a facility outside of Las Vegas.

“It’s unconscionable that the Department of Energy (DOE) and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) went into federal court in Nevada and failed to disclose that they shipped weapons grade plutonium into our backyards," the senator said.

The Energy Department revealed on Wednesday to a federal judge in Reno that it had shipped the weapons-grade nuclear fuel. It explained that it could not reveal the activity earlier because it would endanger national security.

"I’ll be demanding they explain why these agencies ignored a federal court and how this reckless decision was made," Cortez Masto said. The state of Nevada had asked a court to block the movement of the nuclear material, but it appears the Energy Department moved the fuel before the court ruled on the state's petition.

The senator said she will investigate any other possible efforts to move nuclear fuel into the state, as well as any high level effort to bring nuclear waste to the state by reviving the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility.

Other members of the House and Senate delegation joined her in blasting Perry over the incident.

Meanwhile, the Nevada delegation and other Democrats sent a letter to Perry on Thursday, asking him to open an investigation into cases of sexual assault and harassment at the Nevada National Security Site.

The letter was unrelated to the plutonium shipment, except that it involves the facility where the material had been shipped. The letter was in response to a Jan. 25 New York Times story on alleged sexual harassment that took place at the site in November 2017.

The lawmakers not only want Perry to investigate the claims in the article, but "initiate a thorough review of the broader existence of sexual assault and harassment" at all facilities administered by the Department of Energy.

'Rent' returns to Central Valley for quick run

Texto completo: The 20th-anniversary tour of "Rent" — the powerful, sometimes controversial Tony Award-winning musical that first shook audiences in the mid-'90s — begins its two-day run Feb. 6-7 at the William Saroyan Theatre. The musical, which follows a diverse group of seven New York City artists and their daily struggles as members of various marginalized communities, first made waves in 1996. It's loosely based on Giacomo Puccini's opera "La Boheme," which premiered 100 years before the opening of "Rent." This century-later remix includes a handful of characters that are HIV-positive. Several of them are gay or bisexual, one's getting over the suicide of a loved one and many are trying to fight their way out of poverty.
That's heavy stuff, yet there's much more to it than just black clouds. As the New York Times wrote back in '96, "this vigorous tale of a marginal band of artists in Manhattan's East Village ... rushes forward on an electric current of emotion that is anything but morbid."
The musical is the creation of the New York-native composer and playwright Jonathan Larson, who wrote the book, music, and lyrics. Larson died unexpectedly of an aortic aneurysm at the age of 35 the night before the show's first off-Broadway performance. He never got to see the success of "Rent," which earned him three posthumous Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize for Drama, among other honors.
A feature film version of "Rent" was released in 2005 and featured several members of the original Broadway cast. The production ran on Broadway from 1996 to 2008 for more than 5,000 performances — making it the 11th longest-running show in history.
Locally, two Broadway touring shows of "Rent" have stopped at the William Saroyan Theatre over the last 20 years and the Fourth Wall Theatre mounted a production of the musical in 2011.
And on Jan. 27, a live version of "Rent" aired on Fox. Unfortunately, that show failed to impress many critics, with USA TODAY television writer Kelly Lawler writing: "It failed to create the deep, affecting emotion the musical is known for."
The 20th-anniversary revival launched, as you might have guessed, in 2016. It's directed by Evan Ensign based on the original work by Michael Greif, and the original choreographer, costume designer, and music supervisor jumped back in.
In a review of a Rochester, New York performance, Marcia Morphy wrote for Times-Delta/Advance-Register's sister paper the Democrat & Chronicle that the show's rebirth is long overdue.
"Much of 'Rent's' timeless appeal comes from its relatively harsh, unapologetic views of reality," she wrote. "And while it's easy to get swept up in the joy and rowdiness of its rich musical landscape, deep down it's about living life each day as if it were your last."
Because it deals with adult themes, it's not recommended for children younger than 13.
IF YOU GO
What: 20th-anniversary tour of "Rent"
When: 7:30 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, Feb. 6-7

Did you know?
"Rent" ran on Broadway from April 1996 to September 2008 for 5,123 performances.
The musical was loosely based on Puccini's 1896 opera "La Boheme," which debuted in Turin, Italy.
"Rent" was nominated for 10 Tony Awards, winning four, including best musical and best score
Jonathan Larson, who wrote the book and score for the musical, died of a misdiagnosed heart condition the day before the musical's debut. He was 35.
In 1997, Larson was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for drama.
A film version of the musical was released in 2005.

Texto completo: Arianne Phillips, the Oscar-nominated costume designer who became a public name thanks to her work with Madonna, hit her long dark night of the red carpet soul a few years ago.
"I was completely burned out on GoFundMe and tired of feeling like a resister solely on social media," she said on the phone from Los Angeles, where she had just finished working on "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood," the new Quentin Tarantino film. "I kept thinking: What does all this waste and excess amount to?"
This may sound, halfway through the gowns 'n' glam marketing marathon that is the awards season, familiar. The Golden Globes, Critics' Choices and SAGs are done; the Grammys, Baftas and Oscars still to come.
Perhaps you, too, are beginning to get jaded by the endless stream of best-dressed lists, the fawning adjectives dripping in brand names. Perhaps you have, like I have, wondered what happened to the momentum of last year's #TimesUp black-gowned solidarity.
But chances are you did not do what Ms. Phillips and her friend Carineh Martin, a luxury brand consultant, did next: Ask the obvious question.
"Is it possible to take the fascination with celebrity culture and use it to inspire fans to do good?" Ms. Phillips said. To embrace our own most tabloid tendencies, acknowledge they aren't going away anytime soon and exploit them, as Ms. Martin said, for a purpose.
This season will determine whether they are Sancho Panza and Don Quixote tilting at windmills or Davids with an increasingly targeted slingshot.
That would be RAD (Red Carpet Advocacy), founded last July to "change the conversation on the red carpet" so that it's not just about frocks, but frocks and philanthropy, the two so intertwined that you can't talk about one without the other. In January, at the Globes, RAD began to put it into practice.
Our discomfort with the marketing machine that the red carpet, once the province of all-too-human fashion inspiration and mistakes, has become is nothing new. It was expressed in #AskHerMore, that movement to banish the mani-cam and acknowledge actors on their way into a ceremony as more than advertisements for whatever brands they were representing officially (as paid ambassadors) or unofficially (as the recipients of free clothes). Not to mention the brief Globes and Cannes all-black fashion rebellions of last year.
Yet, as much currency as those moments had, they have not succeeded in changing the game in any real sense. E! still asks: "What are you wearing?" Websites and apps (including The New York Times) still run slide shows of arrivals with brand names attached to dresses. Readers, whether they want to admit it, still click on them in the millions (and if you don't ID the dress, they complain).
And celebrities -- male and female -- still need the paychecks that come with the endorsement gigs in order to finance their passion projects, indie films or stage forays.
You can't put the genii back in the bottle. Ms. Phillips and Ms. Martin aren't trying to, anyway. It's their day job (or part of it), after all. They are just adding another element.
The pitch is simple: Stylist and celeb pick the dress or tux (and shoes and jewels and watch) said celeb wants to wear, whether because of a contract or because they love it or both. Then RAD goes to the brand and asks it to donate to the charity of the star's choice. (The brand decides how much.)
And then, when clothes get mentioned, so does the donation -- on the carpet during interviews, as well as in social media posts and news releases.
The relationship becomes less about shared profiteering and more about shared values. And it can be applied not just to the red carpet, but also to events (screenings, parties), retail partnerships and marketing campaigns.
"Arianne and Carineh are deal brokers," said Karla Welch, a stylist who became RAD's conduit to its first partner, Elisabeth Moss, when she dressed her for the Globes in Dior, Roger Vivier, Tamara Mellon and Neil Lane, all of which made donations to the American Civil Liberties Union. "But deal brokers for social change." (Ms. Moss was not paid by Dior.)
So really, what's not to like?
"At the beginning everyone said, 'Wow, I can't believe no one has done this,"' Ms. Martin said. It was all very positive. Then it would go quiet.
"The red carpet is a moneymaking venture," Ms. Welch said. But as anyone who has tried to report on the murky economic relationship between stars and brands knows, no one wants to discuss that.
And the fear was that mentioning donations would suggest a connection to some other sort of financial relationship. Which would run the risk of reminding viewers that maybe the dress a celebrity was modeling was actually chosen because, well, the brand offered the most money. Yucky! No one wanted that.
Even though, as Ms. Martin pointed out, "with RAD, there's no pay to play." The donation piece of the agreement is not part of the bidding war for a celebrity; it happens after the fashion conversation has become a fait accompli. (RAD is not a nonprofit, and Ms. Phillips and Ms. Martin take a 15 percent administrators' fee from the brands on top of the donations, 33 percent of which they in turn donate to charity. Despite the Tinseltown economics, the goal is to eventually turn RAD into a B-corp.)
For a brand and a celebrity, it's more of an investment in the future relationship. Which may sound like a specious nuance or holier-than-thou posturing, but has become an increasingly important factor in endorsement deal making.
At The New York Times International luxury conference in Hong Kong last November, Steve Hasker, the chief executive of CAA Global, one of the biggest talent agencies in the world, told the story of a new client. A millennial actress, she had been offered a significant sum of money to be the face of a consumer brand. She turned it down.
The brand came back with another, multi-million-dollar offer. She turned it down again. Her agents said, "Are you sure?" She said she had researched the company and discovered that it had no women on its board, and that no sum of money would convince her to sign on since its values were not her values.
"Any time you try to change the status quo, it's hard," Ms. Welch said. "But I also don't think it's that hard to ask for a bit more." Resistance is beginning to chip away.
After Ms. Moss's appearance at the Globes, Gucci signed on to support Tracee Ellis Ross, sponsoring a charity screening she hosted of "If Beale Street Could Talk." According to Gucci, it donated $25,000 to #MeToo and the Essie Justice Group through RAD.
David Yurman, the jeweler, is working with RAD on a social media campaign that will pair influencers and issues. Matchesfashion.com is going to host RAD-related events connected to Frieze Los Angeles and the Met Gala.
At the SAGs on Sunday, Mandy Moore wore Jason Wu, Niwaka jewelry and Jimmy Choo, and then worked with RAD so all of them contributed to Unicef. Patricia Arquette donned Christian Siriano, Stephen Webster and Roger Vivier, and it trickled down via RAD to Give Love, her clean water charity.
Ms. Phillips and Ms. Martin are learning as they go.
Ms. Moss's dressing decision around the Globes was so last-minute, for example, that the European brand headquarters were closed for the weekend, so the Gucci and Roger Vivier RAD-related social media language couldn't be approved until after the event had occurred, which lessened the impact. But the women are beginning to believe they have proof of concept.
"It's a paradigm shift," said Ms. Welch, whose client Camila Cabello will be a RAD representative at the Grammys, to benefit Save the Children. As the good ship Oscars approaches, she continued, "You can get on board or not."

Texto completo: Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, announced a settlement on Wednesday with Devumi, a company that sold hundreds of millions of fake followers on Twitter and other social media platforms before going out of business last year.
The settlement is one of the first major efforts by regulators and law enforcement officials to investigate the shadowy market of social media fraud, where armies of fake accounts are sold to businesses, politicians and celebrities seeking the appearance of influence.
Ms. James's investigation was prompted last year by a New York Times report that detailed how Devumi -- then based in Florida -- had earned millions of dollars peddling fake accounts to customers in New York and other states. Many of the accounts, known as bots, borrowed likenesses and personal details from real people, helping them avoid detection and deletion by Twitter.
Devumi had at least 200,000 customers, including reality TV stars, professional athletes, comedians, models and pornographic actors, who bought anywhere from a few thousand to a few million fake followers to boost their online profile. Revelations about Devumi prompted Twitter to immediately block the company from accessing its systems, crippling the business.
Devumi itself relied on fiction: The company advertised a New York office that did not exist, and Devumi's founder, German Calas, claimed degrees he had never actually earned.
Last summer, Twitter, crediting The Times, stripped tens of millions of suspicious accounts from its users' follower counts, hoping to stamp out the sale of fakes.
The settlement was first reported by CNN.
"Bots and other fake accounts have been running rampant on social media platforms, often stealing real people's identities to carry out fraud," Ms. James said in a statement. "As people and companies like Devumi continue to make a quick buck by lying to honest Americans, my office will continue to find and stop anyone who sells online deception."
Mr. Calas did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Whether the settlement will have any immediate impact is unclear. Mr. Calas, who now lives in Colorado, dissolved his social media marketing companies last summer and fall amid negative publicity. In the agreement, signed last month, Mr. Calas did not admit or deny Ms. James's findings, and the settlement requires a relatively small fine of $50,000, intended to cover the cost of the inquiry.
But Ms. James's investigation could set the stage for further crackdowns on rampant consumer fraud and deceit on social media platforms, where so-called influencers -- users with large followings -- can earn a significant living selling endorsements and product placements.
Ms. James found that Devumi's sale of fake accounts and online engagement violated New York laws against fraud and false advertising.
In selling the appearance of social media influence, according to the settlement, Devumi misled both customers who believed they were buying real followers and members of the public whose thinking, such as deciding which candidates or policies were popular, could have been influenced by the fraud.
The attorney general also found that Devumi's sale of fake accounts using identifying details stolen from real people violated a New York statute that prohibits impersonating someone with an intent to obtain a benefit or defraud another person.
Her findings come just months after California took action on the issue, approving a new law that will curb the deceptive use of bots.
Jonathan Albright, a researcher at Columbia University focusing on misinformation, described New York's case as a breakthrough in tackling social media fakery.
"Ideally, it will provide a template through which the bulk sale of online deception and false advertising can be prosecuted," he said.

'Empire' actor allegeshomophobic attack

CHICAGO - Chicago police have opened a hate crime investigation after a man the department identified as a 36-year-old cast member of the television show Empirealleged he was physically attacked by men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

Police wouldn't release the actor's name, but a statement from the Fox studio and network on which Empire airs identified him Tuesday as Jussie Smollett.

A statement from Chicago police says the man said he was walking downtown about 2 a.m. Tuesday when two men approached him shouting, then struck him in the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him before one wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say he was hospitalized in good condition.

Actress Gwyneth Paltrow sued over Utah ski crash

SALT LAKE CITY - A Utah man filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing actress Gwyneth Paltrow of seriously injuring him during ski crash at a Park City resort in 2016.

Retired doctor Terry Sanderson said in the lawsuit that Paltrow was skiing out of control and smashed into him from behind, leaving him with a concussion and four broken ribs. The alleged incident occurred Feb. 26, 2016, on a beginner run at Deer Valley Resort.

Paltrow denied the claims through spokesman Heather Wilson, who said in an emailed statement: This lawsuit is without merit and we expect to be vindicated.

Sanderson's lawsuit claims Paltrow left him injured on the mountain and didn't send for help. A Deer Valley ski instructor skiing with Paltrow and her family and friends filed a false incident report saying Paltrow didn't cause the crash, the lawsuit alleges.

Deer Valley Resort spokesman Emily Summers said the resort can't comment on pending legal matters. The resort is also being sued.

The events are based on the memory of an acquaintance who was skiing with Sanderson that day of the crash, Sanderson's attorney Robert Sykes said. Sanderson said he doesn't remember anything beyond being struck in the back and losing control of his body as he was thrust forward with somebody on his back.

The witness, Craig Ramon, said a Deer Valley ski instructor berated Sanderson as he lay knocked out on the snow, face down. He told Ramon that Sanderson had taken out Gwyneth Paltrow.

Sykes said Paltrow violated the reckless skiing provision of the Summit County code, which requires a skier to stay at the scene of a crash to make sure the other skier is taken care of.

Can Howard Schultz Save Liberalism? The former Starbucks CEO gears up for a presidential run.

Texto completo: This column has assumed that President Donald Trump will be reelected in 2020 because, despite his chronically low approval ratings, he has exceeded reasonable expectations for his presidency and Democratic primaries are likely to yield a radical nominee unacceptable to voters in most parts of the country. But the potential independent candidacy of former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz raises an intriguing new possibility for a winning coalition.
The Washington Post reports that Mr. Schultz has spent months preparing for this possibility and that he "has said that he would not be dissuaded by having to spend $300 million to $500 million of his own wealth on a campaign."
Mr. Schultz is a longtime liberal Democrat, which means he can present a relatively moderate contrast to the extreme leftism expressed by many of the party's top presidential contenders. Notes the Post:
Schultz cited as "ridiculous" a plan by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to tax the net worth of those with more than $50 million in assets. He described the government health plan of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), which would eliminate private insurance, as "not American."
Mr. Schultz has surely noticed that while Mr. Trump has high negative ratings, so do many leading Democrats. RealClearPolitics finds that Mr. Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) are all treading about 14 points underwater when voters are asked whether they have a favorable or unfavorable view. The Post reports:
Advisers say Schultz will be able to win by turning the 2020 campaign into a referendum on the two-party system. They said they were encouraged by the results of an internal 1,000-voter test conducted during Schultz's "60 Minutes" interview on Sunday, during which he confirmed he was considering the race.
In national polls, Schultz's team, led by Republican pollster Greg Strimple, tested a three-way race between Trump, a generic "centrist independent" and named Democratic candidates. They found the independent candidate — a stand-in for Schultz — would fare better in a general election if a more liberal candidate, such as Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), were to win the Democratic nomination, the person said.
To be a contender, Mr. Schultz will not just need a non-radical message on economics. He will also need to get to the right of Democrats on social issues as well. This shouldn't be hard as it has become almost impossible to get to the left of Democratic orthodoxy on abortion, for example.
Kathryn Watson of CBS News reports on an effort by Virginia House of Delegates Democrat Kathy Tran to pass legislation similar to that recently enacted in New York:
At a recent committee hearing, Republican state delegate Todd Gilbert asked Tran to clarify exactly how late in a pregnancy doctors would be able to perform abortions. Gilbert asked if a woman who was about to give birth could request an abortion under Tran's proposed bill.
"She has physical signs that she is about to give birth. Would that be a point at which she could still request an abortion if she is so certified? She's dilating," Gilbert said.
"Mr. Chairman, that would be a, you know, a decision that the doctor, the physician and the woman would make at this point," Tran responded.
"I understand that. I'm asking if your bill allows that," Gilbert posed.
"My bill would allow that, yes," she said.
For now, the former Starbucks boss seems focused on presenting himself as a humble alternative to political blowhards. In a love letter to his adopted hometown published on Thursday in the Seattle Times, Mr. Schultz writes only briefly about his phenomenal success in building the international chain of coffee shops while devoting much of the piece to blaming himself for a decision about professional basketball that many voters outside Seattle might be inclined to ignore. Writes Mr. Schultz:
Starbucks has never been perfect and neither have I. My biggest mistake still reverberates in the city. In 2006, I sold the SuperSonics franchise to new owners who were not from Seattle and moved the team to Oklahoma. The loss of the beloved Sonics devastated thousands of fans. Many rightfully blame me.
In a new book I try to shed light about what went into my decision to sell when we did and the lessons I came away with. The truth is that I wish I held on to the team until someone local wanted to buy it. But after five years as an owner, I was so focused on getting myself and others out of a money-losing situation that I made a bad choice and failed to follow a principle that helped me grow Starbucks, which is to try to balance profit with humanity.
While we're on the subject of mistakes, since Mr. Schultz announced a new rest room policy shortly before leaving Starbucks, there have been reports of difficult conditions for the humans who work there . Still, there is much to admire in the Schultz story of business success.
The Journal's Daniel Henninger has chronicled the Democratic party's modern compulsion to disconnect itself from the private economy. Even running as an independent, Mr. Schultz might help reestablish the connection by energizing Democratic voters who are both anti-Trump and anti-Marx.

Texto completo: People in the Midwest bundled up Wednesday as a deadly arctic freeze enveloped the region, with temperatures in Chicago plunging to -19 degrees in the morning — and continuing to drop.
It's so cold that. . .
As of 11:30 a.m. EST, Chicago was colder than Antarctica.
According to the Apple weather app, it was a balmy -12 degrees in Antarctica — compared with -17 in Chicago.
Earlier this morning, the two places were neck and neck when it came to temperature, according to one tweeter.
Getting around Chicago is very, very tough today.
The record-breaking cold temperatures led to more than 1,600 flights from Chicago's airports being cancelled (1,300 of those at O'Hare International Airport, one of the nation's busiest), and also prompted Amtrak to cancel all trains into and out of the Windy City.
Major attractions are closed because of the bitter cold, including the Lincoln Park Zoo, the Art Institute, and the Field Museum, according to the Associated Press.
In fact, Metra train tracks near Chicago were literally flaming earlier this week after workers warmed the metal with fire.
It feels 73 degrees warmer in Los Angeles than Chicago.
Since the comparison between L.A. and Chicago — 56 degrees and -17, respectively, according to the Apple weather app — is as of 11:30 a.m. EST, that gap could widen as the sun sets in Chicago, but continues to warm up California.
The difference is even more marked in Australia: As of around noon EST, Sydney is forecast to reach a high of 95 degrees Thursday — about 112 degrees warmer than the temperatures in Chicago.
Even Iceland was markedly warmer than Chicago a few days ago.
Chicagoans who are 34 and younger have never experienced temperatures so cold.
Chicago's low temperature Thursday morning was forecast to be close to its lowest ever: -27, which was recorded on Jan. 20, 1985.
One forecast model — the European — predicts that Chicago will hit -29 this week, according to The Washington Post.
You can get near-instant frostbite in some areas.
With the temperatures in Chicago hovering between -15 and -26 on Wednesday, people who step outside with any exposed skin could see frostbite in as little as five minutes, one expert told The New York Times.
Frostbite results in the loss of feeling and color in parts of the body, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Frostbite is no joke: It can permanently damage the body, and severe cases can lead to amputation. It most often affects the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes.
Victims are typically unaware of frostbite, since their tissues are numb. The CDC recommends getting out of the cold at the first signs of redness or pain in any skin area.
“Unless absolutely necessary, do not walk on frostbitten feet or toes — this increases the damage," CDC officials wrote.
Beer deliveries are affected in some places.
The cold weather was even affecting beer deliveries, with a pair of western Wisconsin distributors saying they would delay or suspend shipments for fear that beer would freeze in their trucks, according to the Associated Press.
Even the mail is canceled.
A popular saying goes: "Neither snow nor rain nor heat ..." will stop the mail from being delivered. But extreme cold will on Wednesday.
The US Postal Service issued a rare alert, saying it will not deliver mail in all or parts of five Midwest states (Minnesota, western Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska and western Illinois) because of the dangerous Arctic air blast.
Yes, boiling water is freezing before it even hits the ground.
Wire material from the Associated Press and the Washington Post was used in this report.

SHE WAS FEARLESS, AND A BIT UNSETTLING

Texto completo: It was a question one simply did not ask, even if one wondered.

And you could bet Lee Drury De Cesare would ask it anyway.

When she stood to speak at public meetings back in the day- often in a stylish hat atop her silver-white hair - you could practically see politicians shrink in their seats.

She might call them potted plants for their lack of gumption. Or suggest hirings were made via a casting room couch. She referred to Hillsborough's powerful school superintendent back then, MaryEllen Elia, as "La Elia," and you got her point. Even the way a mayor wore her hair was not spared.

Gadfly with a garrotte is how they thought of her, an elegant hellraiser. After she spoke at one meeting, a school board member dismissed her with a "thank you, Ms. de Vil," a reference to Cruella, the evil cartoon villainess who thought spotted puppies would make a great fur coat. I bet De Cesare loved it.

I didn't realize I'd missed her voice in the mix until someone pointed out her obituary, and her death at 86, last week.

That question that made her famous, or infamous, came at a 2005 Tiger Bay Club luncheon with soon-to-run-for-governor Charlie Crist, now a U.S. congressman.

She said it pleasantly enough: "I have heard that you were gay, sir, and I wanted to know if that was true."

He said he was not, though the answer was almost less interesting than asking the question itself.

Later De Cesare said she was addressing a rumor and also a government that discriminated against gay people. Her daughter Margie De Cesare Jean told me this week that her mother was proud of that question, proud of "any question that made people uncomfortable. She wanted to make sure he was honest and empathetic on those issues."

She seemed fearless. At talk of legal action over something she wrote, she said let 'em sue. "I'll go to jail. I'll take my needlepoint." On her grammargrinch blog, she took people, reporters mostly, to task for failing to tell "lie" from "lay" or to properly navigate a predicate nominative. I was the recipient of her sharp red pen more than once.

She also had her chops: She co-founded the Tampa chapter of the National Organization for Women in the 1970s. She filed complaints against restaurants with all-male wait staff back then, too. She was a nurse, an English professor and a stewardess, briefly, back when they were still called stewardesses.

Two years ago she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, her daughter said. At her senior community in Lutz, she sometimes give speeches at dinner about women's rights or voting.

She was a voice here, but her family would probably want you to know a little more of her, a woman who loved her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, whose life included orchids, opera, the New York Times daily and those cruises she took to see the world with Tom, the former mayor of Madeira Beach and her husband of 63 years.

And that she said, often, that she couldn't believe a girl who grew up in rural Six Mile Creek outside of Tampa could have been this lucky.

She will be buried wearing a small and fetching black hat.

Visitation for Lee Drury De Cesare is tonight from 6-6:30 pm at A Life Tribute Funeral Care, 4040 Henderson Blvd. in Tampa, with services at 6:30 pm. Instead of flowers, donations can be made in her memory to support education at Lamb Elementary School, 6274 S 78th St., Tampa, 33619. For more information go to alifetribute.com.

Texto completo: A "Star Wars" spinoff is on TNT. And Brad Bird's superhero family sequel hits Netflix.
What's on TV
ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY (2016) 7 p.m. on TNT. Disney and Lucasfilm may have marketed this "Star Wars" story as an offshoot, but fans of the galaxy way, way out there will find many familiar things here: Yes, there are impossibly big spaceships looming over the plains of far-off planets; yes, our heroes have smaller, rustier laser guns than their clean, evil opponents; and yes, there's a witty robot chiming in at inopportune moments to tell them the odds. (He's played, through motion capture, by Alan Tudyk.) Felicity Jones stars as Jyn Erso, a young woman who becomes involved with heroic resistance fighters while the Death Star is being built. Forest Whitaker plays Jyn's mentor, a galactic extremist. Jyn's rebel crew includes: Diego Luna as a resistance fighter, Riz Ahmed as a pilot and Donnie Yen as a blind monk. "The cast is wonderful," A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. But the movie that this fine ensemble operates in, Scott cautions, is "thoroughly mediocre."
THE WOLVERINE (2013) 5 p.m. on FX. The director James Mangold brings an artful, small-scale sensibility to the X-Men franchise with this film, which stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, the clawed antihero, in Japan, where he battles samurai and a guilty conscience. "A modest superhero picture may sound like a contradiction in terms," A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "But really it is a welcome respite."
WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT (1993) 10:30 p.m. on Showtime. Angela Bassett won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Tina Turner in this biopic, which centers on that singer's tempestuous relationship with Ike Turner, her onetime husband. (Laurence Fishburne, also nominated for an Oscar, plays the role.) "In less confessional times, the tale of Ike Turner's stormy, violent relationship with his long-abused wife and star attraction might not have had the makings of a Hollywood biography," Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The Times. "Depicted by this broad, savvy, entertaining film as a survivor and a victim in equal parts, Ms. Turner becomes an emblem of contemporary tell-all dramaturgy."
What's Streaming
INCREDIBLES 2 (2018) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Brad Bird's crash-bang follow-up to his 2004 computer-animated hit sees Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) left to take care of the house and kids while Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), his wife and the matriarch of this superhero family, heads off to take on the evil villain. "Few can rearrange the world as artfully and as enjoyably as the Incredibles, except of course their creator Brad Bird," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "Like his superheroes, Mr. Bird is extraordinarily good at destruction, which is very much in evidence in the virtuosic, often delightful 'Incredibles 2."'

Texto completo: City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said Monday he is considering a run for mayor in 2021. 
"It's a big decision, but I am thinking about a potential people-powered Mayoral run," he wrote on Twitter. 
Should he decide to run, Johnson pledged not to take any campaign donations from real estate developers, lobbyists and corporate PACs. He added that he won't take more than $250 from any donor, even though the current limit on individual donations is $2,000.
Johnson, who told The New York Times last year that he "never" wants to be mayor, is accepting donations on a new website featuring photos of him on the subway, talking with fellow New Yorkers and speaking at rallies. He was "averaging about one contribution per minute" Monday morning, he wrote in another tweet.
Johnson is the first openly gay and HIV positive city council speaker and would be the first to become mayor. He has represented Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen, Greenwich Village and parts of SoHo and midtown since 2014. Before that, he served on the Manhattan Community Board 4 and in 2011, he became the youngest community board chair in the city at age 28.
The speaker would face a growing field of potential mayoral candidates, including Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, City Comptroller Scott Stringer, former City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and more.
Current Mayor Bill de Blasio was first elected in 2013 after a stint as public advocate and won re-election in 2017. Under current law, he is limited to two consecutive four-year terms in office.

Trump has this one right: China's 5G is a real national security threat

Texto completo: Update: Hours after this story posted, the Justice Department unveiled sweeping charges against Huawei. For more, click here.
Forget about the wall and worry about the back door.
That's my takeaway from Sunday's eye-opening — and somewhat scary — front-page story in The New York Times about the US government's efforts to persuade allies and other countries to shun next-generation mobile phone networks made by Huawei Technologies and other Chinese companies.
Unlike President Trump's phony immigration crisis, China's potential ability to infiltrate so-called 5G networks is a real security threat. This time, the president has it right.
“Nervousness about Chinese technology has long existed in the United States, fueled by the fear that the Chinese could insert a 'back door' into telecom and computing networks that would allow Chinese security services to intercept military, government and corporate communications," according to the Times story by David E. Sanger, Julian E. Barnes, Raymond Zhong, and Marc Santora. “But the concern has taken on more urgency as countries around the world begin deciding which equipment providers will build their 5G networks."
What is 5G? It's the fifth generation of mobile technology that AT&T, Verizon, and other phone companies around the globe are beginning to roll out. But more than just providing faster downloads of YouTube videos, 5G networks are, as the Times explains, the first “built to serve the sensors, robots, autonomous vehicles and other devices that will continuously feed each other vast amounts of data, allowing factories, construction sites and even whole cities to be run with less moment-to-moment human intervention."
In other words, if there is ever a real Matrix, it will run on 5G.
Huawei (pronounced “hwa-way") is China's largest supplier of telecom gear. The United States fears that the company and other Chinese suppliers are willing or unwilling participants in Beijing's corporate and military espionage efforts.
Installing their equipment, the argument goes, would give China's leaders the ability to monitor communications, hack into computer systems, and steal military and trade secrets.
Huawei denies that it is controlled by or works for the Chinese government, and the United States has offered no hard evidence to back up its concerns, even as it has blocked Huawei from the US 5G market and pushes countries including Poland to do the same.
Australia has banned Huawei's 5G equipment and gear made by ZTE, another Chinese supplier, and carriers in Britain are weighing their options.
Huawei's image has been hurt by the December arrest in Canada — at the behest of US officials — of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive and daughter of the company's founder, on charges that she defrauded banks to help Huawei evade sanctions against Iran. Earlier this month a Huawei employee was arrested in Poland on charges of spying.
On Monday, the feds turned up the heat. The Justice Department unsealed criminal sanctions charges against Huawei, two of its subsidiaries, and Meng.
The company was also charged in a separate case with stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile, according to federal prosecutors.
The US-China tariff spat is just a sideshow for this bigger fight over how to protect the security of 5G networks. And it's a hard fight to win. The Internet is global, and there will always be places where China — and let's not forget the Russians and North Koreans — could slip through a back door.
The US government does its fair share of spying on enemies and friends alike. So it's hard to blame the Chinese for trying to keep up.
We can only hope that the both countries eventually find it in their best interests to be competitors, but not enemies.
But until that day arrives, the Trump administration — for all its lying, mistakes, and cynical policies — is right to sound the alarm about China and 5G. The balance of economic and military power may hinge on that back door.

Texto completo: A recent blog post said U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to bring 93 family members with her on a trip to Afghanistan that was canceled by President Donald Trump.
"Who takes 93 family members (mostly children) on a secret government business trip on military aircraft, paid for by taxpayer dollars?" the post asked. Not Pelosi, according to PolitiFact.com. The story is false. The story was published on The Marshall Report, a website known to post things that aren’t true, PolitiFact said.
The trip was to include Pelosi and six other lawmakers, along with top staffers, but no family members, PolitiFact reported. The group planned to meet with North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials in Brussels before heading to Afghanistan to visit with U.S. troops.
Hours before they were to depart Jan. 17, Trump canceled the trip, saying Pelosi needed to stay in Washington. D.C. "negotiating" to end the partial government shutdown, The Washington Post said.
Comparison shows different ice shelves A recent entry in the 10 Year Challenge, in which social media users post images showing how something has changed over 10 years, uses side-by-side photos to show the deterioration of sea ice from 2008 to 2018. But the photos are of different ice formations, according to The Associated Press. In fact, they are from opposite sides of the earth. The photo purported to be from 2008, actually taken in 2016, shows the Getz Ice Shelf in Antarctica while the other photo, taken in 2018, is of a small piece of ice in the Chukchi Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean. The photo of the ice remnant in the Chukchi Sea was taken by Julienne Stroeve, an ice scientist with the University of Manitoba, while studying ice positions in the summer, AP said. "This picture is really misleading," Stroeve told AP. "You can’t just cherry pick individual years. You have long-term change happening."
The 10 Year Challenge meme has been shared more than 200,000 times, AP said.
Wall won’t stop drugs In a speech last week, President Donald Trump made the case for a wall at the southern border, claiming it would "quickly and greatly" reduce the drug problem in the U.S. "We can stop heroin," he said.
But findings by the Drug Enforcement Administration contradict the president, according to The New York Times. The DEA report said "only a small percentage" of drugs seized by law enforcement come across the border between ports of entry, the Times said. Drugs smuggled into the U.S. are most often inside passenger cars or tractor-trailers, despite inspections at the border. Other methods include trafficking drugs in buses and cargo trains and through tunnels.
Even stopping all drugs from Mexico would not end America’s drug problem, the Times said. The U.S. Centers on Disease Control and Prevention said nearly 40 percent of opioid deaths in 2016 were a result of prescription painkillers — drugs made by pharmaceutical companies.
Quote falsely attributed A fake quote attributed to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is just another of the false rumors and accusations aimed at the New York congresswoman, according to Snopes.com. The fake quote attributed to Ocasio-Cortez, "Owning guns is not a right … If it were a right, it would be in the Constitution," has been shared numerous times on social media, Snopes said. The quote can’t be found in any news articles, interviews or social media posts that involve Ocasio-Cortez.
Snopes points out that it isn’t believable that Ocasio-Cortez, who often talked about gun rights would not be aware of the Second Amendment.
The congresswoman has said she is a "firm believer" in the amendment and an assault weapons ban could strengthen gun laws without "running afoul" of the Constitution.
Fast food quote fake A fake quote was attributed to Clemson University quarterback Trevor Lawrence after President Donald Trump hosted the national champion football team at the White House, according to PolitiFact.
The football team was treated to an assortment of fast food from McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s and Domino’s Pizza on Jan. 14 following a victory over the University of Alabama a week earlier.
Following the feast, a meme showed Lawrence saying, "President Donald Trump got all our favorite foods, it was the best meal we ever had. Then we go and see the coastal elite media trashing it for not being organic vegan. We’re football players not bloggers. This was a perfect blue collar party."
But Lawrence, 19, said on Twitter that everything in the meme was "fabricated" and he didn’t know where it came from, PolitiFact said. "However the trip to the White House was awesome!" Lawrence said.

U.S. Removes Rusal From Sanctions List; Relief for pro-Putin oligarch's company cheers metal markets, angers Democrats who call Trump too easy on Russia

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--The Treasury Department on Sunday removed Russian aluminum company Rusal from its sanctions list after a blacklisted billionaire and close ally of President Vladimir Putin, Oleg Deripaska, delivered on a promised plan to divest his majority ownership stake, the office said.
The issue had become a political controversy amid concerns the Trump administration was going easy on Russia, but many former Treasury officials and other sanctions experts said the move was made following longstanding policies under which the office does its work.
The delisting will likely reassure aluminum markets concerned that the world's second-largest producer would cut off a critical source of the metal, especially for the European companies Rusal sells to.
Under a deal Treasury agreed with the board of Rusal's holding company, EN+ Group PLC, Mr. Deripaska cut his shares to below the 50% threshold designated in Treasury's sanctions guidelines. Another firm controlled by EN+, energy company JSC EuroSibEnergo, also was removed from the blacklist as part of the deal. None of the companies were accused of conduct that would give rise to sanctions; they were targeted because of Mr. Deripaska's ownership .
"The action ensures that the majority of directors on the EN+ and Rusal boards will be independent directors--including U.S. and European persons--who have no business, professional, or family ties to Deripaska or any other" blacklisted entity, Treasury said in a statement.
"The companies have also agreed to unprecedented transparency for Treasury into their operations by undertaking extensive, ongoing auditing, certification, and reporting requirements."
The sanctions on the companies were never fully implemented, as the U.S. repeatedly issued licenses allowing certain business activity while the two sides tried to work out a deal. The final licenses were set to expire Monday.
Mr. Deripaska, however, remains under sanctions; he was added to the blacklist in April as part of a broader package targeting Russian meddling in U.S. elections , cyberattacks and other provocations.
Democratic-led efforts in Congress to block the move delisting the companies failed earlier this month after they couldn't secure enough Republicans in the Senate to join the effort. The House of Representatives passed a resolution disapproving of the deal.
Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who has played a leading role in pushing back against the Treasury's deal, said the department ignored the House's vote. "This represents just one more step in undermining the sanctions law, which President Trump has obstructed at every opportunity, while Russian aggression remains unabated," he said in an emailed statement.
Under the deal, Mr. Deripaska's stake in EN+ drops to 44.95%, down from 70%. He can only vote 35% of those shares. EN+ also is required to replace its board with members approved by the U.S. Treasury and to allow the U.S. to see internal company documents, including earnings reports and board minutes.
The broad contours of the deal were released to the public in a letter to Congress. But Treasury didn't release the full agreement, and a department spokesman said last week that it generally doesn't do so because "they can contain proprietary information or be otherwise privileged."
A recent New York Times article raised questions about the deal, citing the full agreement, including the allegation that Mr. Deripaska will retain control of the company by combining his stake with investments held by his allies, including members of his family.
The Treasury spokesman said there is no truth to the assertion, threatening sanctions designations on any shareholder who might knowingly facilitate significant transactions for Mr. Deripaska, or on his behalf.
"Furthermore, in instances where there could be a perception that a shareholder may not be independent of [Mr.] Deripaska, Treasury required that shareholder to assign their voting rights to an independent third party," he said. "In a large publicly traded company, it is the shareholder voting rights through which the shareholder exerts control and influence."

Texto completo: BATH, Maine -- Photographer Heather Perry is best known for her dazzling underwater photography. Her images have graced the pages of magazines like National Geographic and Smithsonian, as well as newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe and New York Times.
Now, Perry is wowing Mainers with a project completed on dry land, a few blocks from her home in Bath's South End. It's called Southgate Faces.
In collaboration with audiographer Hopper McDonough, Perry made a series of revealing portraits of workers outside Bath Iron Works' South Gate. The close-up, unflinching color photos are accompanied by interviews McDonough conducted as Perry made her pictures.
The pair started the project in 2016 and worked on it for more than a year. A few days each spring and fall, when their schedules allowed and the weather cooperated, they set up a makeshift photo studio across from the shipyard's South Gate. Then, they'd coax workers on their lunch breaks to sit for a picture.
The idea for their project came from the fact that both Perry and McDonough lived near the yard but knew nothing about the men and women who worked there. They simply wanted to know more. Interacting with workers on a one-to-one basis seemed like the best way to get to know them.
The photos and audio interviews are currently on display at the Frontier Cafe on Brunswick until Feb. 10. Perry will give a public talk about the project at the Portland Camera Club on Monday Jan. 28 at 7 p.m. at the Woodfords Club.
The Bangor Daily News sat down to talk with Perry about Southgate Faces recently at her home in Bath.
Q: How did you get permission to do this project? Every time I get my camera anywhere near the shipyard, the police are there, asking me what I'm doing, in like two minutes.
A: I know! Which is amazing because now anybody with an iPhone can walk across the bridge and get a picture. When my son was about three [he's now 13] I wanted to get a photo of the workers coming out of the gate. So, at 3:20 p.m. I said, "Get on your tricycle," and we went down there and stood across the street with my camera. Security was like, "You're going to be arrested," and my son -- that poor kid -- is still scarred from it [laughing]. He though the police were going to arrest his mother.
Q: So, you must have approached the management before you started.
A: Yes. We anticipated the problem because it was a big deal. We literally brought a photo studio with us. They said they liked the idea but wouldn't let us do it on the campus -- but across the street is public property and [they said,] "We can't tell you what to do over there." Then, we went to the city and asked if we could use a parking space across the street and they were like, "You can use it for two hours."
Q: How helpful.
A: We ended up using two parking spots right outside Fiona's Diner, which is directly across from the South Gate. It was kind of a rigamarole to set this up. We'd have to grab the two parking spots in the morning -- so we'd park both our cars there at six o'clock in the morning, then walk to my house. At 10:30 a.m. we'd walk back down, we'd move my car and set up the photo studio -- and the cops didn't give us a hard time about it, and we got [Fiona's Diner] on board, too.
Q: So after all that hassle, was it hard to convince the workers to let you take their pictures? They don't have a lot of time on their lunch breaks.
A: Most of the people we got were actually smokers. A lot of workers take their lunches in the yard but they can't smoke in the yard. We bought gift cards for lunch at Fiona's and we gave every single person [who sat for us] a gift card. It was just about persistence and getting them familiar with seeing us there and building trust. I'd say 65 or 70 percent of the ones we asked said yes -- but some I had to work on for weeks.
Q: What did you tell them was the purpose of the project?
A: [We'd say], "These are some of America's last manufacturing jobs. So who are you? We just want to know who you are, just want to have a conversation." We wanted to be very careful that this wasn't like us going to the zoo. We weren't coming down there to gawk. Like, look at the welders, look at the blue collar workers. We weren't trying to turn it into: Look at the noble, dirty [working men]. It was really about listening to someone that I don't have any interaction with at all -- and the way I do that, is with a camera.
Q: What's one of your big takeaways, now that you've had that conversation?
A: I learned that -- and this I'm not proud of this -- I made some assumptions going into this. I try not to, as a journalist, but I thought: Because I don't want to weld, or because I don't want to grind rust off of metal all day long, this is a job you take because you have to. What a [horrible] thing to think. Who the hell am I? Why would I think that? This is the problem that we're dealing with in this country right now. They all, pretty much, love their jobs and what they do. And it's not just about the security that they feel. They love to weld and they love to grind paint and they love to build warships for America. They feel a huge sense of pride and a huge sense of purpose that's desperately missing in a lot of this country.

Texto completo: "I've made more than one mistake, we all have. I should have never done an interview with the New York Times."
Stve King
U.S. Representative
PRIMGHAR, Ia. — Pamela Harmon, a retired nurse and 4th District resident, stood up at U.S. Rep. Steve King's town hall meeting Saturday morning to address the embattled representative.
"As I came up today I thought it must be difficult to come with the difficulties you've been through, to come back and face your constituency. And I was wrong," Harmon said. "You're proud and talented and we're proud of you, and thanks for coming to see us."
The crowd applauded.
More than 40 Iowans braved the snowy weather to attend, a group largely made up of 4th District residents and King supporters. It was the first Iowa crowd King has publicly addressed since his controversial New York Times quote on white nationalism and white supremacy resulted in his committees being stripped and a House rebuke.
The quiet crowd wrapped in winter wear did not question King about his comments. Before asking their questions, several said they did not believe the accusations against King.
"You being accused of being a racist, and all that other stuff," said Kelly O'Brien, the O'Brien County GOP chair, "I know you're not, Steve. I've known you forever."
King echoed that sentiment in his opening remarks. He compared the backlash to his recent comments on white supremacy and nationalism to the "inquisition" U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh faced during the Judiciary Committee hearings on his nomination.
King said his comment to the New York Times — "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" — was part of his defense of Western civilization. He said the backlash was about the left "policing our language."
"I've made more than one mistake, we all have," King said. "I should have never done an interview with the New York Times."
He took questions from the crowd, which his staff vetted for content. King said his committee removals meant less now that Republicans weren't in charge of the House, but still said conservatives will miss having him on the Judiciary Committee.
"There's a 70 percent chance they'll attempt an impeachment of Donald Trump," he said. "And they need seasoned members to give them an opportunity to defend themselves and defend them."
King also answered numerous questions on border security and immigration. He stood by his stances that the federal government needs to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and lightly criticized Trump for caving on the recent government shutdown.
"He didn't stick with this one the way I thought that he said that he would," King said, adding that "I think that he's closer to declaring a state of emergency."
When crowd members asked King about getting livestock and farm workers into the 4th District — which often are immigrant populations — he said border security needs to be addressed first.
"We can't get to the rational solutions because we've irrationally let our borders stay open," he said. "The first thing is secure the border and then talk about everything else."
It was King's first stop in a town hall series he has planned for the year. He has said he will hold public meetings in all 39 counties throughout the 4th District. O'Brien County is in far northwest Iowa, and Primghar is far from most of the major cities in the district — more than an hour from Sioux City, nearly three hours from Ames and two and a half hours from Mason City.
Judy Kulligan, a Sheldon Democrat who attended the town hall, said the location was deliberate.
"He picked Primghar and O'Brien County for a reason," she said. "He knew this would be safe, he knew people weren't going to come out on a cold morning and drive in the snow to challenge him. He knew it'd be easy and that's why he came here."
King got 65.2 percent of the vote in O'Brien County in last year's election. He won 50.4 percent of the vote in the district, making it his closest election since he started his nine terms in the House.
King has held few town halls in recent years. In 2017, King told the Sioux City Journal he held fewer of them because of fears over safety and potential derailment by protesters.
The representative said he preferred tele-town halls and requested meetings with community members, where he could discuss policy without opening up the floor to protesters.
He also tangled with the media over coverage of his victory party after the November midterms. He barred the Des Moines Register and other media outlets from attending. There were no reports of media outlets denied access in advance of Saturday's town hall.
It was also King's first 4th District event since Republican challengers announced they would run against King. Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra announced he was running in early January. Jeremy Taylor, a Republican Woodbury County supervisor, announced his candidacy Thursday. Bret Richards, an Irwin Republican, is also running.
But Gaye Kammerer, a Primghar King supporter at the town hall, said she hasn't given challengers any thought.
King ended the town hall by reciting Rudyard Kipling's poem, "If—." Kipling is a famous British poet who published controversial pro-Imperialist poems, including one titled "The White Man's Burden."
"If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings — nor lose the common touch ..." the poem reads. "Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And — which is more — you'll be a Man, my son!"
"I've made more than one mistake, we all have. I should have never done an interview with the New York Times."

Texto completo: Roger Stone, a GOP political operative and longtime friend and adviser to President Trump, was in frequent contact with members of Trump's campaign about WikiLeaks' efforts to release materials damaging to Democrats before the 2016 election, according to an indictment filed against him Friday.
Stone was arrested Friday morning on seven counts of obstruction, lying to Congress and witness tampering related to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the election.
A major focus of the probe has been whether Stone coordinated with WikiLeaks or its founder, Julian Assange, as the group published thousands of Democratic emails that prosecutors say were hacked by Russian operatives.
Stone was not charged with any crimes related to communicating with WikiLeaks about its activities, and he has repeatedly denied that he conspired with the group.
But the 24-page indictment against him details numerous occasions when Stone claimed to campaign officials that he had information about WikiLeaks or was in contact with Assange - and it depicts Trump aides and allies as acutely interested in learning about the group's plans in advance.
Among those who sought information from Stone, according to the filing, was a "senior Trump Campaign official" who "was directed" by an unnamed person to contact Stone as soon as WikiLeaks began publishing Democratic emails in the summer of 2016.
Stone also communicated about WikiLeaks with "a high ranking Trump Campaign official," whose emails in the filing match those of former campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon. And Stone received a query about the group's activities from a "supporter involved with the Trump campaign," whom he then asked to communicate via a secure messaging app, according to prosecutors.
In all, Stone interacted with at least four people close to the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks, according to the indictment.
The numerous interactions show that Trump allies were eager to leverage the hacked Democratic emails to their advantage - and that they saw Stone as someone with inside information useful in that effort.
The details in the court filing undercut Stone's past statements - including remarks in an interview he gave to The Washington Post last fall, in which he denied discussing WikiLeaks with Trump campaign officials.
"There are no such communications," Stone said at the time.
Stone has also repeatedly said he had no advance knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans and was just passing along public information and tips.
In an interview Friday, Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said the charges against Stone did not show evidence of any wrongdoing by Trump.
"The president is safe here," he said. He declined to comment immediately on the indictment's description of a senior campaign official being directed to contact Stone.
Prosecutors say that Stone started telling senior Trump officials in June and July 2016 that he had information that WikiLeaks would release documents that would hurt the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
The first public indication of the group's plans came roughly around that time. Assange gave interviews in June in which he claimed that WikiLeaks held material relevant to the White House race.
Then, on July 22, days before the start of the Democratic National Convention, WikiLeaks published internal Democratic Party emails, upending the convention and forcing the resignation of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) as party chairwoman.
According to the indictment, after the July release of DNC emails, a "senior Trump Campaign official was directed" to contact Stone and inquire about what else WikiLeaks had that could damage Clinton's campaign.
That inquiry from the Trump campaign came amid public speculation that Russian operatives were responsible for the hack.
But on the campaign trail, Trump mocked the idea that WikiLeaks was the beneficiary of Russian assistance. As the group released additional stolen material in October, he repeatedly declared his support for WikiLeaks.
Stone's contact with people close to the Trump campaign accelerated in early October 2016.
At the time, Assange was hinting that he was preparing to release more Clinton-related documents. Trump supporters were anxiously waiting for a new WikiLeaks dump that could serve as an October surprise before Election Day.
According to the indictment, Stone wrote on Oct. 3, 2016, to a "supporter involved with the Trump campaign" to assure the person that WikiLeaks' next release was imminent.
"Spoke to my friend in London last night," Stone wrote, in an apparent reference to Assange. "The payload is still coming."
That day, Stone also received an email from a person described in the indictment as "a reporter who had connections to a high ranking Trump Campaign official" who asked what Assange held.
"Hope it's good," the reporter wrote.
An unredacted version of the email previously released shows that the reporter was Matt Boyle, a writer at the conservative website Breitbart who was close to Bannon.
Stone responded: "It is. I'd tell Bannon but he doesn't call me back."
An attorney for Bannon declined to comment on the exchange when Stone posted it last fall in a column on the Daily Caller website, shortly before the New York Times published a story describing the message.
According to the indictment and the full email exchange, Bannon made contact with Stone the next day, after Assange held a news conference in London but failed to release any Democratic materials.
"What was that this morning???" Bannon wrote.
Stone responded that Assange had a security concern, but he promised that WikiLeaks would release "a load every week going forward."
Prosecutors say that Stone also exchanged text messages that day with a "supporter involved with the Trump campaign," who asked whether Stone had heard more from London, another apparent reference to Assange.
Stone responded "yes" and asked to speak on a "secure" line, inquiring whether the supporter could communicate through WhatsApp.
On Oct. 7, WikiLeaks published the first tranche of roughly 55,000 emails stolen from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that it would release in the weeks leading up to Election Day.
An "associate of the high ranking campaign official" sent Stone a text message that day, according to prosecutors. "Well done," it read.

Texto completo: What right does a privileged European author have to write about servants, swamis and sex in modern India? By today's strict standards for cultural appropriation, not much. The audacity to mine foreign cultures to make one's art provokes social media outrage and criticism. Such a writer risks being "canceled" before any kind of literary liftoff.
Fortunately for readers, then and now, the late German-English writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala was writing about India at a different time. The new anthology "At the End of the Century" brings 17 of the Booker Prize-winning writer's most haunting short stories to a new generation of readers.
Jhabvala, who died in 2013, was best known in the United States as the Oscar-winning screenwriter for the filmmaking team of James Ivory and Ismail Merchant. She adapted E.M. Forster, Henry James and Kazuo Ishiguro for the screen and helped create a commercial model for handsome, bourgeois adult cinema. But her first love was literary fiction, reflected in this beautifully curated selection of some of her most celebrated writing. Collected over six decades of a writing life that unfolded in England, India and America, they're stories of exiles, lovers and professional transgressors.
My reservations about Jhabvala's "Indian" writing despite her non-Indian background quickly dissipated as I found myself fully absorbed and binge-reading this extraordinary collection.
Decades before the ascent of contemporary immigrant fiction, Jhabvala was using her migrations to illuminate the universal human longing for connection and place. Jhabvala was born in 1927 into a privileged and assimilated German Jewish family in Cologne. She experienced the indignities of the Nazis' rise to power and fled with her family to England at the last possible moment in 1939.
After the war, her father learned that his entire family had been executed in German death camps, and he committed suicide. It was something she rarely spoke about in interviews and never wrote about in her fiction. But loss, melancholy and darkness pervade even the most lighthearted stories in the new collection. Her defining experience as an outsider informed her ability to inhabit characters regardless of their gender, class, race and caste. In a public lecture entitled "Disinheritance," she spoke of how the erasure of her past allowed her to adapt elsewhere and turned her into a writer. "Once a refugee, always a refugee," she told the BBC.
Jhabvala married an Indian architect and moved to New Delhi in 1951, just four years after India gained its independence from the British Empire. At the fault lines of the country's transition from colonial rule to freedom, Jhabvala found her infinite sea of stories.
Jhabvala's best stories are almost all women's stories - of being conned, wronged and loved by lesser men. She reserves her most acid humor for the privileged white female tourists who came to India to "find themselves," crafting delicious scenes in ashrams where Oxbridge-educated English women seek nirvana. In the story "An Experience of India," one of these clueless characters exclaims: "I had come to India to be in India. I wanted to be changed."
Jhabvala writes in biting first person from the perspective of a woman who doesn't see herself as racist: "I ate anything anywhere and always like everyone else with my fingers (I became good at that) - thick, half-raw chapattis from wayside stalls and little messes of lentils and vegetables served on a leaf, all the food the poor eat; sometimes if I didn't have anything, other people would share with me from out of their bundles. Henry, who had the usual phobia about bugs, said I would kill myself eating that way. But nothing ever happened." That is, of course, until something terrible and nauseating does.
Jhabvala's stories of Indian women stifled by religious tradition, nosy relatives and unfulfilled sexual desires are equally cutting. In the story "The Widow," she writes, "when he was dead, she almost missed him, and it was when she reminded herself of other things about him - his old-man smell, and his dried legs, when she had massaged them, with the useless rag of manhood flopping against the thigh - that she realized it was better he was gone." For a screenwriter responsible for the manicured world of Merchant-Ivory films, on the page, Jhabvala is surprisingly vibrant, darkly funny and, dare I say, racy. Illicit affairs, interracial arousals and fiery arguments followed by intense makeup sex are par for the course.
Jhabvala's writing falls between the high empire stories of Rudyard Kipling and E.M. Forster and the post-colonial reclamations of Indian stories by Indian writers. There is a stillness, precision and conservative restraint to Jhabvala's narratives that runs counter to the explosive, expressive and liquid energy of later Indian Booker Prize winners, including Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy. Her frame is less democratic, often focusing on lives of the privileged, Westernized and geographically mobile. As historian Maya Jasanoff recently wrote in the New Yorker, Jhabvala's work fell out of style by the 1980s, replaced by writers untangled from the rules of the traditional English novel and the political immediacy of empire. She also moved on physically, leaving New Delhi for New York and a prolific screenwriting career.
Today Jhabvala's writing feels as if it has slipped through time. The India of which she writes has ceased to exist. The post-colonial condition she portrayed, for Indian and British alike, has been replaced by other political and cultural nationalisms. But the questions her stories raise - about belonging, desire and the boundaries of love - feel as contemporary as great literature always does. She was a reticent and private woman who rarely gave interviews. Today, when book tours and literature festivals deliver writers to audiences, Jhabvala probably would have failed. She would have been unmasked and eventually branded a cultural appropriator, "stealing" from others' lives and places, in ways writers almost always have. But in 2019, Jhabvala's angled ways of seeing reveal truths beyond the certitude that our current moment demands of its artists. This posthumous collection is a wonderful reintroduction to one of the 20th century's great female writers and a deliciously intersectional and thoughtful passage to her India.

Globalization

Texto completo: While world leaders converged on Davos, Switzerland, this past week to discuss "Globalization 4.0" at the World Economic Forum, President Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May stayed home to deal with globalization-related crises: a government shutdown over Trump's demand for a border wall and Parliament's rejection of May's Brexit deal. Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade tensions continued to roil financial markets, and trade conflicts contributed to another downgrade of global growth forecasts. The political crossfire over globalization has propagated a raft of myths. Here are five of the most prevalent.
Myth No. 1 Populist nationalism has begun to reverse globalization.
After 2016's electoral surprises (Brexit and Trump), many predicted globalization's imminent demise. A headline in the Guardian proclaimed, "Globalisation as we know it is over - and Brexit is the biggest sign yet," and one in the Boston Globe read, "Trump won. Globalization lost. Now what?" In 2017, former HSBC chief economist Stephen King published a book titled "Grave New World: The End of Globalization, the Return of History."
The actual interactions that take place among countries, however, tell a different story. The new DHL Global Connectedness Index, coming next month, shows that globalization - measured based on flows of trade, capital, information and people - rose to a record high in 2017. For the first time since 2007, all four types of flows crossing national borders increased significantly. Trade in goods grew at its fastest pace since 2011, and international tourism the fastest since 2010. Free calls over the Internet continued to power strong growth in international communications.
In 2018, major public policy threats to globalization did turn from rhetoric to reality. There were tit-for-tat tariff increases, new restrictions on foreign corporate takeovers and crackdowns on immigration. But there was no general collapse of globalization. Trade continued growing last year, though at a slower pace, while foreign direct investment declined.
Myth No. 2 We live in a world of borderless markets.
This idea has been around for a long time, especially in business circles. Strategy consultant Kenichi Ohmae's 1990 book was titled "The Borderless World." In 1997, economics journalist Frances Cairncross published "The Death of Distance." Then, the most popular book about globalization ever, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman's 2005 volume, "The World Is Flat," proclaimed a "level playing field" for global competition and collaboration.
NYU Stern and IESE Business School professor Pankaj Ghemawat has been debunking this myth for more than a decade: The vast majority of activities that could happen either within or across national borders are still domestic rather than international. For example, only about 20 percent of economic output is exported, 17 to 19 percent of tourism is international, 9 percent of global output comes from the foreign operations of multinational firms, roughly 7 percent of phone call minutes are international (including calls over the Internet), and 3 percent of people live outside the countries where they were born. Furthermore, trade, capital, information and people flows are all still dampened significantly by distance.
This myth has especially pernicious effects on policy debates. Just about everyone overestimates international flows, and people who overestimate them by a wider margin worry more about globalization exacerbating inequality, climate change and other problems. Surveys have shown that simply telling people the actual levels of immigration into their countries reduces the proportion who think there are too many immigrants or that immigration is a problem. Moreover, the fact that distance still matters is the main reason Brexit is such a challenge. Geography alone means that Europe will remain Britain's most important market.
Myth No. 3 The U.S. is one of the world's most globalized countries.
With politicians at both ends of the ideological spectrum railing against free trade, Americans could be forgiven for supposing that the U.S. economy is especially exposed to competition from imports. Most Americans also grew up thinking of the country as "a nation of immigrants," and until last year, that phrase was even part of the mission statement of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Surprisingly, the United States is actually the advanced economy that imports the least relative to its size (and only six emerging economies import less intensively). In 2017, it imported goods and services worth 15 percent of its gross domestic product. Japan is the only advanced economy that comes close (18 percent), and even China imports more intensively than the United States does (19 percent). The United States ranks higher on immigration, but there are still more than 30 countries where a larger share of the population was born abroad. America also has fewer immigrants than most Americans think: 15 percent of the population, compared with the average guess of 29 percent in a 2018 survey.
The United States ranked 27th out of 140 countries on the 2016 DHL Global Connectedness Index, but that relatively high position was mainly because of how broadly its international flows span the globe. On the "depth" dimension of the index, which measures international flows relative to domestic activity, the United States ranked 100th.
Myth No. 4 Emerging markets are globalization's new leaders.
This notion gained traction after Chinese President Xi Jinping's vigorous defense of globalization at Davos three days before Trump's inauguration. "China's Xi Jinping Seizes Role as Leader on Globalization," the Wall Street Journal declared. (Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a similar play at Davos the following year.) A 2017 headline in the Financial Times said that "Emerging markets are set to lead globalisation." There is more than just rhetoric here: China has pushed bold international infrastructure and institution-building initiatives, and the share of world trade and investment involving emerging economies is up significantly relative to the early 2000s.
Actually, though, advanced economies are much more globalized than emerging economies, which trade about as intensively as advanced economies do but are only one-third as integrated into international capital flows, one-fifth as active in movements of people and one-ninth as linked to information flows. Emerging economies are also less globalized in the sense that they maintain strong connections to a narrower set of countries. They had been closing the gap with advanced economies on the intensity of their international flows, but their progress has stalled, in part because of China's rebalancing away from export-led growth.
Myth No. 5 Globalization is the main culprit behind rising inequality.
From the right, Trump argued during his campaign that "globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache." From the left, Bernie Sanders held that "the global economy is not working for the majority of people in our country and the world. This is an economic model developed by the economic elite to benefit the economic elite."
While economists continue to debate the relationship between globalization and inequality, a substantial body of research suggests that other factors, such as technological change and domestic policies, have contributed more to rising inequality than globalization. Simple measures help reinforce this conclusion. Since the United States is the advanced economy that imports the least relative to its size, it's hard to see how imports could explain its ranking near the top on inequality among developed nations. In contrast, eight of the 10 most globalized countries are in Europe, and they all maintain more equitable income distributions.

Texto completo: On paper, the six-day strike teachers strike that disrupted learning at 900 public schools across Los Angeles was a fight about orthodox demands like lower class sizes, higher pay and more support staff from nurses to librarians and counselors.
But a core issue and perhaps the most divisive barely touched the bargaining table: the future of the city’s 224 charter schools.
Education policy experts contend that although United Teachers Los Angeles – the union that represents the teachers in L.A. Unified – wins regarding charter schools at the strike’s conclusion may be largely symbolic, the strike has sparked a broader conversation happening across Southern California on charters that will likely make its way to Sacramento and stands to impact the direction of public school districts across the state.
Public education is essentially a two-sector system codified into state law in 1992 – the traditional, centrally managed school district and charter schools independent from a central school board.
As enrollment in the Los Angeles school district declined for 15 years, charter schools grew into a full-fledged industry educating more than 112,000 students and posing tough competition for traditional public schools.
Angeleno enrollment in charters, which are publicly funded but privately managed, reportedly drains $600 million a year from the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is tasked with serving around half a million students. While the schools do undergo a rigorous approval process complimented by hundreds of pages of paperwork, they operate free from many regulations and all but a few are nonunion.
To clear up any confusion about district-affiliated versus independent charters, a district-affiliated charter is a hybrid. The word “charter” in its name reflects a status the school adopted to secure more outside sources of revenue but it operates within the confines of the district.
During the strike
In the months leading up to and during the six-day walkout, UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl frequently decried “the unregulated growth of charter schools” to the press and his own membership.
“That doesn’t mean all charter schools are bad,” he repeated in his characteristic baritone, rather what began as a well-intentioned experiment now undermines traditional public schooling as more charter schools backed by billionaires and neglect the neediest students.
Charter school advocates call the union’s messaging on charters during the strike a blatant mischaracterization.
“I’d really like Alex Caputo-Pearl to come to the schools I run,” said Gloria Romero, the executive director of Scholarship Prep Charter School in Santa Ana and a former California state senator who while representing the San Gabriel Valley and East Los Angeles served as chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee.
“We’re closing the achievement gap for children who are English language learners and special education, if anything. There are some great schools in L.A. Unified but there are too many pockets where schools are chronically underperforming.”
John Rogers, director of the UCLA’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, warned of sometimes superficial narratives surrounding charter schools.
“I think there are a number of somewhat simplistic analyses that don’t capture the full picture,” he said. “Many charter schools enroll large numbers of low-income students and students of color and we shouldn’t forget that fact.”
That said, charter advocates have in recent years poured millions into political campaigns, including in Los Angeles, where billionaire and charter supporter Eli Broad spent almost $10 million in 2017 along with allies in an effort that won a majority on the LAUSD Board of Education.
The charter sector, according to Rogers, is “a mix of some amazing educators who have worked within district bureaucracies and got frustrated and wanted in their words more freedom, some wealthy people who wanted to do good and felt like their money wasn’t going to be spent well in the district, and then some with ties to right wing think tanks and organizations who are deeply committed to undercutting the power of unions as kind of a bulwark of the democratic party.”
He added that it is rare for charters to admit students with the most substantial special needs, but that’s mostly backed up only by anecdotal evidence.
In the agreement
The main appearance of charter schools in the 40-page agreement reached between UTLA and LAUSD this Tuesday is a provision calling for more community input in cases of potential co-location, when a charter school moves into either occupied or un-occupied space on the campus of a traditional public school.
The still-temporary deal must be ratified by the School Board in a meeting slated for Jan. 29.
“The district has to inform us in December about any schools that are targeted for co-location,” said Caputo-Pearl on KPCC’s AirTalk Wednesday. “That gives time for respectful notice to parents … and certainly parents can ask questions and teachers can push back.”
As a side-bargain, UTLA also said the school board agreed to vote this month on a resolution that calls for Gov. Newsom to enact a cap on new charter schools at LAUSD while the state further studies the issue. If approved, the resolution would be a call for more state action on public charter schools.
Yet “it remains to be seen” whether the measures become more than a symbolic win for the union, said author of a book on California politics and New York Times opinion writer Miriam Pawel.
One out of every three independent charter schools in Los Angeles is co-located. While the arrangements are mutually beneficial, many complain of discord as entirely separate schools attempt to share everything from libraries to cafeterias and playgrounds.
“Co-location seemed to be a significant step for the union potentially. But the district doesn’t have has much leeway, so I think those are issues that will have to be addressed at the state level, and there’s definitely some interest in addressing it in Sacramento.”
Looking ahead
What all parties appear to agree on is that the teachers strike drew attention from the Inland Empire to L.A. to the befallen state of traditional public education in the second-largest school system in the nation, but that the future of charters can only be determined in halls of the state capital.
“The strike opened the conversation about how the broader public can begin to develop rules and regulations through the legislative process,” said Rogers, “purposeful planning of how we bring on new charter schools, how we reauthorize charter schools, how we think about the location of charter schools.”
And charter leaders like Gloria Romero are prepared to make a case.
“I look forward to sitting at that table testifying before former colleagues and new folks to say hey forget about the campaign contributions that you got from CTA (California Teachers Association) and let’s think about what this means in terms of student achievement,” she said.
“The fact that charters are thought to be so dangerous, that’s a product of their success and that’s what I hope a fair hearing in Sacramento would find.”

Texto completo: Rosanna Arquette is done being frightened of Harvey Weinstein.
The actor, who once co-starred in the Weinstein-produced 1994 crime drama “Pulp Fiction,” is one of several women who tell their stories — of being sexually assaulted or harassed by the now-disgraced movie mogul — in the documentary “Untouchable,” which had its world premiere Friday evening at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival.
Arquette — who has become a proponent of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements — said the cascade of women and men coming forward with stories of sexual assault and harassment, which began when Weinstein’s misdeeds were made public in October 2017, are spreading to industries beyond Hollywood.
“Every day I get phone calls — they tell me their stories,” Arquette said after the film, while getting compliments from festivalgoers.
Director Ursula Macfarlane interviewed Weinstein accusers, former colleagues at both Miramax and The Weinstein Company, and journalists — including Pulitzer Prize winners Ronan Farrow, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, whose investigative work in The New Yorker and The New York Times chronicled decades of Weinstein’s behavior. Beyond the assaults, the movie discusses efforts to discredit and defame anyone accusing Weinstein.
Weinstein, who is facing criminal charges in New York, consistently has denied allegations that any sexual encounters he had were non-consensual. Macfarlane said her production team from the BBC requested an interview with Weinstein. “Obviously, he declined our request,” she said.
Sundance is an appropriate venue for “Untouchable” to premiere. The festival is where Weinstein made his reputation for acquiring independent films — including “sex, lies and videotape,” “Reservoir Dogs” and “Clerks” — and marketing them into hits. Also, at least three women have accused Weinstein of assaulting or harassing them in Park City hotels during Sundance; most famously, actor Rose McGowan accused Weinstein of raping her in Park City in 1997.
Another woman interviewed in the film is Lauren O’Connor, a former literary scout for The Weinstein Company, who filed an internal complaint about Weinstein’s abusive behavior. The complaint was leaked, and was a major part of Kantor and Twohey’s New York Times stories about Weinstein.
“He’s done everything to try and destroy Lauren,” Arquette told the audience at the MARC Theatre, adding that O’Connor has racked up debts in the six figures to fight Weinstein.
“There’s a huge tax on integrity,” O’Connor said during the Q&A.
O’Connor, like Arquette, is determined to fight on. “The only way forward is to figure out how to turn that into something good,” she said.

'Voices Appeared': Orlando Consort sings the story of Joan of Arc

Texto completo: The Orlando Consort, a superb British vocal quartet that specializes in medieval and early Renaissance music, has long built its programs around themes and inventive, historically apt story lines - a technique that lets the singers mold disparate works into concerts with an appealingly logical narrative overlay.
In "Voices Appeared," which the Orlando presented in a Portland Ovations concert Thursday evening at the University of Southern Maine's Hannaford Hall in Portland, the narrative was provided by "The Passion of Joan of Arc," Carl Theodor Dreyer's highly stylized, disturbingly intense silent film about the 1431 trial and execution of Joan, who had been canonized in 1920, only eight years before the film was made.
For the occasion, the quartet - Matthew Venner, countertenor; Mark Dobell and Angus Smith, tenors; and Donald Grieg, baritone - were joined by a fifth singer, Robert Macdonald, a bass who was given plenty of time in the spotlight, singing unaccompanied plainchant during some of the interrogation scenes, just as Venner often sang alone during Joan's responses. Mostly, though, the program brought together polyphonic works from Joan's era, some of which she may have heard, since it was used in churches in her region.
The idea of fitting out Dreyer's film with a tailor-made score has long appealed to musicians, probably because the lingering closeups on Joan's face (she is played by RenÃ©e Maria Falconetti) - placid on the surface, but with a measure of underlying distress - and on the expressions of her judicial and clerical accusers, seem to demand musical amplification and commentary.
Among the composers who have taken up the challenge are Richard Einhorn, whose 1994 "Voices of Light" provided those elements in a score that pivoted between neo-Medievalism and post-Minimal textures, using a text that draws on Joan's letters, the Bible and the writings of medieval churchwomen (most notably the abbess and composer Hildegarde von Bingen). In 2011, two rock composers - Adrian Utley, from Portishead, and Will Gregory, from Goldfrapp - gave the film a Philip Glass-influenced score for chamber orchestra (with guitars replacing the violins and violas) and a chorus singing wordlessly.
The Orlando Consort's use of period-appropriate music makes great sense, but involved some deft tailoring. Since the Mass movements and other (mostly) sacred settings the group selected were not composed with the timings of the film's scenes in mind, some were excerpted. For others, interesting combinations were made - for example, the opening piece, Guillaume Dufay's "Je me complains," was performed with a substituted text from a 1429 poem by Christine de Pizan, in which Joan is compared to the biblical heroines Esther, Judith and Deborah.
The score was assembled by Grieg, the group's baritone, who also supplied a richly detailed program book essay, and a scene breakdown that listed the musical selections alongside descriptions of the scenes they accompanied, with comments giving historical details that further explain Grieg's choices. Rarely are such useful and all-encompassing notes provided at concerts; but then, the presentation of film as part of the production meant that the lights were so low that these documentary aids had to be either absorbed before the performance, or reconciled afterwards.
You could, of course, just take in the film and the music, and not worry about the details. Works by Dufay, Gilles Binchois, Estienne Grossin and Richard Loqueville, as well as anonymous settings (some, like the "Agincourt Carol," reasonably familiar) and plainchant dominated the program, but there were also some lovely works by less familiar composers - Johannes Cesaris' grief-filled "Pour la douleur" and Johannes Reson's spare "Ave verum," for example.
The Orlando singers performed this music with the passion and supremely balanced blend that have always been their hallmark. That said, Hannaford Hall might not have been the ideal setting for "Voices Appeared." This is music that thrives in the opulent resonance performed by a church, and when I have heard the Orlando in the past, it has been in a more acoustically live setting. Hannaford is quite dry, but if there was an upside, it was that the lack of reverberance let you hear the varied textures of the group's sound with unusual clarity.

King should give up seat in Congress

Texto completo: Congressman Steve King should resign. He has lost even the potential to effectively represent his Iowa constituents because of his abhorrent comments about white nationalism and white supremacy.
The move by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to strip King of his committee assignments leaves Iowa without a seat on the vital House Agriculture Committee, as well as judiciary. It also leaves King with far less opportunity to work for his constituents on critically important rural development issues.
Not that King has seemed particularly interested in working for his district in recent years. Instead of holding town-hall meetings with his constituents, King spent many congressional breaks globe-trotting to Europe and hobnobbing with hard-right, nationalist leaders.These meetings apparently served to reinforce his own warped views of cultural purity and immigration.
King has often made Iowa a laughing stock on the national stage with his offensive and absurd remarks about undocumented immigrants, comparing them to dogs or disparaging them as drug mules with calves the size of cantaloupes.
But it wasn't until a few weeks before the November election that top national Republicans and corporate donors started to abandon King. That was just after the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. It also was just after it had been revealed that King spent time on a trip funded by a Holocaust memorial organization to meet with a far-right Austrian group associated with neo-Nazis. Meanwhile, King had been under fire for tweeting his support for a Toronto mayoral candidate known for white nationalist views.
We don't make the argument that King should resign lightly, or based on partisan preferences. He was duly re-elected to a ninth term in November by voters who had every opportunity to recognize the Kiron Republican's caustic, racially charged ideology related to immigration. King opened the new year by seeming to recognize a need to spend more time in Iowa: He announced a town-hall meeting in each of his district's 39 counties.
But then, apparently in an effort to claim credit for President Trump's border-wall plans, he gave the New York Times what should be a career-ending quote: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" King said to the Times. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
He has since tried to walk back the comments, claiming the quote was taken out of context and denouncing white nationalism and white supremacy. But to no avail: National Republicans and even staunch GOP supporters in Iowa — Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst and Gov. Kim Reynolds — have expressed disgust at his original remarks.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said if King doesn't understand why "white supremacy" was offensive, he should "find another line of work." We agree. He may as well mail a cardboard cutout of himself to Washington for all he'll be able to accomplish if no one is willing to work with him.

Texto completo: The divided government of 2019 is a mirror image of the divided government of 2011. Back then, Democrats controlled the White House and Senate, while Republicans had recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2010 midterms. Today, Republicans control the White House and Senate, while Democrats have recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2018 midterms.
It’s the same situation, essentially. But today there is a vastly different public conversation about the balance of power in government. These days, we are often reminded that Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and therefore Speaker Nancy Pelosi stands on an even level with President Trump. Back in 2011, when the two players were Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama, there wasn’t as much of that kind of talk.
A comparison, from the Nexis database of newspapers, magazines, websites and television transcripts: From Election Day 2010 until Jan. 20, 2011, there were 18 mentions of "Boehner" and "co-equal." From Election Day 2018 until Jan. 20, 2019, there were 683 mentions of "Pelosi" and "co-equal."
Democrats have been saying it every day, starting with Pelosi the morning after the election. Congress’ role is "not to be a rubber stamp, but a co-equal branch," she said, adding that she and her colleagues had a "responsibility for oversight as an independent, co-equal branch."
Pelosi said much the same many more times by Jan. 3, when she officially won the speaker’s gavel. In her first speech on the House floor, she said, "The legislative branch is Article I: the first branch of government, co-equal to the president and judiciary."
Virtually every other House Democrat said it, too. Rep. Steny Hoyer: "co-equal branch." Rep. Adam Schiff: "co-equal branch." Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz: "co-equal branch." Rep. Gerry Connolly: "co-equal branch." Rep. Doris Matsui: "co-equal branch." Rep. Brian Higgins: "co-equal branch." Rep. Lauren Underwood: "co-equal branch." Those are just a few examples.
There was even talk to the effect that Pelosi is now equal to the president. The chief advocate: Pelosi herself. "Asked if she considers herself Mr. Trump’s equal, she replied, ‘The Constitution does,’" The New York Times reported in an article about the speaker.
A Jan. 17 discussion on CNN focused on the speaker’s battle with the president over the government shutdown and State of the Union address. Republican Rep. Michael Turner said of Pelosi, "She needs to come to some recognition that she’s not equal to the president of the United States."
Susan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution scholar, CNN analyst, and editor of the blog Lawfare, blanched. "Pretty wild to hear a member of Congress forcefully argue that congressional leaders are constitutionally inferior to the president," Hennessey tweeted. "James Madison weeps."
But the speaker of the House is not, in fact, equal to the president of the United States. Congress, not the House, is a co-equal branch of government. Actually, more than equal — it is, as Pelosi noted, the first branch of government. But to exert its will, Congress must be united. To overrule the president — and, of course, Congress can even remove the president — Congress must be united.
Pelosi controls just half of Congress. And she only controls the House when she gets 218 members to agree with her. To overrule a presidential veto, she needs 287 members to agree with her. And then the Senate, controlled by Republicans under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has to go along.
On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the executive branch is the only branch of government headed by a single person. That gives that one person, in this case President Trump, the power of the executive branch. No single person in the other two branches has that power.
The bottom line is the House is one-half of a co-equal branch of government. The speaker of the House is enormously powerful in the House. If she can persuade majorities, and sometimes supermajorities, of House members, and then majorities, and sometimes supermajorities, of the Senate to go along with her, she can block the president’s agenda and exert enormous power in the government. But by herself — not so much.
The system simply was not designed for a head-to-head equal competition — the president versus the speaker. It doesn’t work that way. It’s entirely understandable that Democrats and their allies in the press would want to see Pelosi as equal to the president. But that doesn’t make it true.

Joe Biden offers a hollow, bipartisan confession

Texto completo: A former vice president has offered a rare public confession.

“I read in the New York Times today that one of my problems is, if I ever were to run for president, I like Republicans,” Joe Biden told a Wednesday gathering of the United States Conference of Mayors. Then, he paused briefly before making the sign of the cross, saying, “Well, bless me father, for I have sinned.”

Gathered in Washington, D.C., from around the country, the dearly beloved loved it. It was classic Biden.

And it was those kind of folksy quips that endeared the vice president to a large part of the country and could charm voters again should Biden decide to run for president in 2020. A skilled retail politician and a practicing Catholic, Biden has been perfecting this blue-collar-uncle-at-the-end-of-the-bar persona since Delaware first sent him to the Senate during the Nixon administration.

The Biden confession comes during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history when bipartisanship seems like a forgotten virtue. The basis was a New York Times report insinuating that Biden helped a Republican, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, keep his seat.

Three weeks before the election, Biden traveled to Upton’s district. He delivered a speech before the Economic Club of Southwestern Michigan. He collected a $200,000 speaking fee. He praised the Republican for helping to pass medical research legislation, called him a champion in the fight against cancer, and said Upton was “one of the finest guys I’ve ever worked with.”

Biden wasn’t offering an endorsement, a spokesman told the New York Times. Biden was expressing sincere admiration for Upton’s work after the vice president’s own son, Beau, died from cancer.

This would prove something of an unforgivable sin, especially after Upton triumphed over his Democratic challenger later that November. The Times reports that it raised questions about his party leadership and whether Biden would make an acceptable 2020 champion.

But for Republicans, Biden wasn’t exactly a political savior.

The Upton race was close, but not that close. The Republican defeated the Democrat by more than 13,000 votes, or four-and-a-half percentage points. FiveThirtyEight ranked the district as R+7.7, and voters there had voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016. A few words from Biden might have helped Upton down the stretch. It's unlikely it determined the race.

Biden isn’t likely to be revered by any Republicans as a saint, either. His current bipartisan tone sounds very different from his old rhetoric. It wasn’t that long ago that Biden warned a predominantly African-American crowd that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would “put you all back in chains.” As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee before that, Biden oversaw what then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas described as “a high-tech lynching.”

Republicans will remember those episodes and temper with context any gratitude they have for Biden’s help in Michigan. GOP voters will see his confession as a nice bipartisan overture. They just aren’t likely to take it seriously.

REP KNOCKS PROF'S TAKE ON TRUMP; MURPHY WRITES TO 58 OTHERS, OBJECTING TO COURSE SYLLABUS

Texto completo: A Republican Assembly leader is criticizing a UW-Madison political science professor's course syllabus for what he sees as a "politically polarized characterization" of Donald Trump's presidency.
Rep. Dave Murphy, R-Greenville, leveled the criticism Wednesday in a letter to UW-Madison professor Kenneth Mayer, who is teaching "The American Presidency" this semester. The first lecture took place Tuesday.
The syllabus' first page includes a two-line paragraph saying Trump supporters "rejoice in his contempt for what they insist is a corrupt D.C. establishment."
It then includes an 11-line paragraph that begins: "To others, he is a spectacularly unqualified and catastrophically unfit egomaniac who poses an overt threat to the Republic."
"If the course description already tells basically what the bias is going to be in the course, it's pretty hard to sift and winnow that," Murphy said, referring to an 1894 Board of Regents statement on academic freedom enshrined in bronze outside Bascom Hall.
Murphy, chairman of the Assembly Committee on Colleges and Universities, copied at least 58 people on his letter to Mayer University of Wisconsin System President Ray Cross, UW- Madison Chancellor Rebeccca Blank, all 18 members of the UW System Board of Regents, the other 15 members of the Assembly committee, the seven members of the state Senate's committee on universities and 16 members of the Legislature's Joint Committee on Finance, which plays a key role in allocating money to public universities.
The letter is a variation of a feud often fought across the country by conservatives and universities in recent years over academic freedom and the rights afforded to professors, who tend to lean liberal.
Mayer, who came to UW-Madison in 1989 and cites at least five teaching awards on his resume, declined an interview request Wednesday.
Professor defended
University spokeswoman Meredith McGlone said in a statement that Mayer leaves his political opinions out of the lecture hall and cautioned against judging the entire course by a syllabus.
"At a time of perhaps unprecedented political polarization, he presents his students with the latest scholarly work on and contemporary readings about the presidency, seeks to provide students with the skills to put both conservative and liberal views into context, and encourages students to draw their own conclusions based on evidence and thoughtful debate," she said.
McGlone said Mayer used a similar approach in previous courses that delved into the events surrounding the 1998 impeachment proceedings against then-President Bill Clinton.
The College Republicans of UW-Madison also stood up for Mayer in a statement, saying that based on personal experiences with him as a professor, members have found him to be an intellectually engaging professor that treats conservatives fairly.
Murphy said he became aware of the syllabus when UW-Madison student McKenna Collins posted the syllabus' first page on Facebook Monday.
?Preconceived notion'
Collins, a senior studying communications, said in an interview that she has no problem taking a critical look at the presidency. She said she has been a member of both the College Republicans and College Democrats groups on campus, but isn't affiliated with either in her final college semester. She declined to say who she voted for in the 2016 election.
The omission of any of Trump's accomplishments from the syllabus does a disservice to students starting out the course, she said.
"It inhibits our ability to engage in objective and thoughtful dialogue this semester because we now are entering the course with this preconceived notion (of Trump) that (Mayer) has manufactured," she said.
Murphy said in an interview that Mayer makes his opinion of Trump clear in the syllabus, which has a "chilling" effect on students in the classroom.
"If you were a Trump supporter, unless you were supremely confident that you could hold your own against a tenured college professor, you might very well think, 'I'm just not going to go there,'" he said.
Asked what should be added or removed to reflect a more accurate and objective view of the Trump presidency, Murphy said he is not trying to rewrite Mayer's syllabus.
"That's his job, not mine," he said.
If the syllabus swapped former President Barack Obama with Trump to describe a "spectacularly unqualified president," Murphy said he "absolutely" would have sent the same letter.
In the news
Both Collins and Murphy cast doubt on news reports about the Trump presidency, a handful of which are listed as reading on the syllabus. Mayer requires students to read a national newspaper of record, such as The New York Times or The Washington Post.
The syllabus also includes readings with a conservative perspective, such as Margaret Taylor's essay "Declaring an Emergency to Build a Border Wall: The Statutory Arguments." The White House and Donald Trump's Twitter feeds are incorporated into the lesson plans.
Murphy said some of the background Mayer provides such as multiple Trump campaign officials' guilty pleas and U.S. intelligence agencies concluding Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee computers is in the public discourse as established fact, but he said issues regarding the Trump administration are still being investigated.
He referenced a BuzzFeed story last week, which reported that Trump directed his longtime lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. The special counsel's office investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election took the rare step of disputing the news organization's description of statements Cohen allegedly made to the special counsel's office and its characterization of documents and testimony the office had obtained.
"You have a bunch of students who listen to the news, take a lot of the things for instance, the Buzzfeed report as fact, and never really find out the real facts," he said. "This doesn't lead me to believe they're going to get the real facts in this situation."
Gesture offered
Murphy, who wrote in his letter that he is a fierce advocate of academic freedom, said his intention is to spark a dialogue on what is, and is not, appropriate for a course syllabus. He issued Mayer an invitation to his office and encouraged the professor to show some good faith and invite a Trump administration official to speak with students.
This isn't Murphy's first foray into critiquing course syllabi.
In late 2016, Murphy asked UW-Madison to cancel a course titled "The Problem of Whiteness" because he said it was inappropriate and a waste of money. School officials defended the course.
Two years later it is still listed as a course offered in the spring 2019 semester. CREDIT: KELLY MEYERHOFER kmeyerhofer@madison.com

RISE OF THE GOLDEN JACKAL

Texto completo: On a hill above Trieste, Italy, at the western edge of Slovenia, I heard the golden jackals howl.
This was my second night out with Miha Krofel, a conservation biologist at the University of Ljubljana, driving rural roads through farmland and forests.
The night before, along with two volunteer researchers - one a photographer who had become something of a jackal specialist - we had visited four locations where Krofel had heard jackals.
Sunset came late, so we didn’t start until around 10 p.m. and finished close to 2 a.m. At each spot, we played a recording of a jackal pack howling and then waited about five minutes for a response. Played it again. Waited. We did this three or four times at each spot.
We heard dogs barking, unidentified rustling in the bushes, and a faint “krek krek” call that Krofel said came from a corncrake, a bird that is endangered in Slovenia.
But no jackals.
They were in the area, Krofel assured me. He and 37 other volunteers - scientists and naturalists, dedicated and informed - have been monitoring the animals throughout Europe. The effort is led by Krofel and Nathan Ranc, a doctoral student at Harvard and the Edmund Mach Foundation in Italy.
Jackals vastly outnumber Europe’s wolves, totaling at most 117,000 by the latest official estimate. By contrast, a high estimate of Europe’s wolves is about 17,000. Slovenia has 200 to 400 jackals, Krofel estimated, and about 75 wolves.
This is an unheard-of expansion of a medium-size predator into a continent that it once inhabited only on the fringes. And it has only started to capture scientific interest in Europe, which is beginning to grapple with what the expansion means ecologically, and what the issues are in terms of conservation and legal status.
Jackal facts
So far, the jackals have posed some problems for sheep farmers. How the animals will be received by the general public as their numbers rise is an open question.
Smaller than North American coyotes, the golden jackal weighs an average 20 pounds. It is native to the Middle East and southern Asia, ranging as far east as Thailand and inhabiting Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.
The species arrived at the southern edge of Central and Eastern Europe about 8,000 years ago, fossil evidence suggests, and started to expand slowly in the 19th century. But the current boom began in the 1950s and has accelerated over the past 20 years.
Jackals are one of the least-studied canine predators. Like wolves and coyotes, jackals have family-based packs, but the groups tend to be smaller, with four to six animals, while wolf packs may include 15 animals.
A monogamous pair of jackals forms the core of a pack; the young may stay with the parents or leave to establish their own packs.
Invading the home
of the wolf
Substantial populations of jackals now live in a number of European countries, including Greece, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Austria, Italy and, above all, Bulgaria, which has the largest population.
Jackal wanderers - or advance scouts - have been found in France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Belarus, Estonia, the Netherlands and Denmark.
Scientists think jackals began to move north because wolves were targeted for eradication, particularly in the Balkans. That opened a door, since jackals seem to avoid areas well populated by wolves.
Climate change doesn’t seem to have been a factor, although it will probably be significant in the future. Jackals don’t live in places where snow is on the ground more than about 100 days a year. As warming continues and snow cover declines, more European territory will open up to them.
In Senozece, in southwestern Slovenia, Krofel and I visited a sheep farm on a rocky hillside ringed by forest. About 350 sheep were sprinkled across the rough pasture; they moved away in leisurely fashion as we walked up the slope with Krofel’s two dogs and a hyperactive young cat.
Sheep farming is a small part of Slovene agriculture, but one likely to be affected by jackals. I asked the farmer, Leon Franetic, about the jackals and whether their presence in his region was OK. Krofel didn’t get a chance to translate.
“Not OK!” Franetic said emphatically. He went on at greater length in Slovene, with Krofel translating. He had learned to live with some predation, he said: “We’ve gotten used to the wolf,” because one pack roamed nearby.
But jackals were one canine predator too many. In the past three years, wolf attacks had gone down, but now jackals were killing the sheep. In 2017, Franetic said, he lost 20 to 25 sheep.
Although jackals did not initially expand into wolf territories, Krofel suggested that the two species seemed able to coexist. Wolves now live deeper in the abundant forests of Slovenia, while the jackals prowl along the edges, closer to farms and towns.
The jackal kills were messier, leaving sheep corpses only partly eaten, Franetic said. As he saw it, the wolves were professionals, the jackals sloppy amateurs.
Marjan Tomazic, a hunter and forest service official, told us many farmers felt the same disdain for jackals but were less inclined to abide wolves than Franetic. Occasionally, for unknown reasons, a wolf or wolves will go on a spree and kill as many as 50 sheep.
Still, “this is the home of the wolf,” said Tomazic, a confessed admirer.
Living a successful life
The next night, we stopped by the annual meeting of about 30 hunting clubs in the Primorska region, in Divaca, a town near Lipica.
One hunter mentioned hearing a pack of jackals nearby, so after the dinner we drove to the location. We stopped in a plateau of fields and apple trees near Trieste. Krofel began playing the jackal recording.
Jackal howls are a bit like sirens but softer and a little wobbly. He said that some people say they sound like babies crying, without that kind of urgency. Nor do jackals have the yips of coyotes or the full-throated baying of wolves. They sounded to me a bit demented, but that’s a human and North American reaction.
There was no response to the first recorded howls. But immediately after the second, I heard a faint howl, and then another one, closer. Then, for about half a minute, a group of jackals alternated distant wails.
Since it is hard to tell individual howls apart from a distance, Krofel and his colleagues count jackals this way: “One, two, more than two.”
As the calls drifted to an end, he breathed a sigh of relief. “Finally.”
These jackals have established a pack and are reproducing. They are living a successful life. And their offspring have every chance of establishing new packs as they move into Western Europe.
But what will happen as that expansion continues is hard to predict. Ranc said that if the spread of jackals in Europe shows anything, it reflects “the fundamental uncertainty in ecological systems.”
“Who would have guessed that this small canid would be the likely winner of poisoning campaigns of wolves in the Balkans?” he added.

Texto completo: US senator says backing measure shows 'strong statement of support'
A day after the U.S. House voted overwhelmingly for a measure aimed at making it difficult for a president to quit NATO, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins declared her support for the proposal.
Collins, a Maine Republican, is part of a bipartisan group that introduced a resolution this month to prohibit a president from withdrawing from NATO without first securing approval from the Senate.
"Over the past seven decades, NATO has proven to be the world's most successful military alliance and a major force for peace, stability, and prosperity. It is critical that we reaffirm the United States' commitment to this vital pillar of our national security," Collins said Wednesday in a prepared statement.
Collins told her colleagues that supporting the measure "would be a strong statement of support for this important alliance that serves the strategic interests of the United States."
Both of Maine's U.S. House members -- Democrats Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden -- were among the 357 lawmakers who supported a proposal Tuesday to bar the use of federal funds by a president to withdraw from the treaty that has locked the U.S. to Canada and European allies in common defense since 1949.
The Senate resolution requires the president to win two-thirds support from the Senate to suspend, terminate or withdraw from NATO. It also prohibits funding any effort to do so and grants congressional counsel permission to challenge a president in court if he tries to sidestep the provision.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said in a prepared statement that President Donald Trump's "repeated threats to withdraw from NATO are dangerous."
"Our NATO allies have fought alongside our troops since World War II, yet President Trump disparages these nations and cozies up to our adversaries," he said. "At a time of increased Russian aggression and global threats, our alliance with NATO is more important than ever to ensure the safety of the American people."
Collins and Kaine were joined by Republicans Cory Gardner, of Colorado; Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina; and Marco Rubio, of Florida; along with Democrats Jack Reed, of Rhode Island; Chris Coons, of Delaware; and Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut.
The New York Times reported recently that senior administration officials said that several times over the course of 2018, Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
In public, the president has griped on a number of occasions that European nations are failing to spend what he considers their fair share of the cost of the mutual defense required by the NATO treaty.
A bill with the same provisions was introduced last year after a July summit, which included Trump and other NATO leaders, led to fears the president might try to quit the organization. It was championed by Kaine and U.S. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, who died Aug. 25.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, on Wednesday defended his characterization of President Trump as the "grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue," saying Trump has exhibited racially insensitive behavior for decades.
Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, was pressed during a CNN interview about comments made this week at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in Harlem at which he referred to the term for the leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
"I did a use a colorful phrase, but of course I don't believe that the president is a card-carrying member of the KKK," Jeffries said. "But it did capture a troubling pattern of racially insensitive and outrageous, at times, behavior that spans not months, not years, but decades."
Jeffries, elected to his leadership post in November, cited several examples, including Trump's insistence that the "Central Park Five" were guilty, even though DNA evidence exonerated them in the notorious 1989 rape case in New York.
Jeffries also cited Trump's advocacy of the "racist lie" that President Barack Obama was born abroad as well as comments Trump made after a deadly clash at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.
Jeffries noted he has "consistently said no" when asked whether he considers Trump a racist. But he said Trump's "series of racially insensitive remarks" should not be ignored. "We cannot whitewash that. We cannot hide it," he said.

Mayor of Indiana city joins 2020 Democratic race
Pete Buttigieg, 37, mayor of South Bend, Ind., announced Wednesday that he's entering the Democratic presidential primary, a long-shot campaign that may test the appeal of a youthful, Midwestern profile.
In an e-mail to potential supporters, Buttigieg said he was forming an exploratory committee and cast himself as a candidate of the future, stressing his generational identity and calling for policies “untethered to the politics of the past" on issues like climate and economic opportunity.
“What will America look like in 2054, when I reach the age of the current president?" Buttigieg said. “How will we look back on 2020?"
A veteran of the Afghanistan war, Buttigieg was a consultant at McKinsey before entering politics.
It is unclear if a municipal executive who oversees a city of about 100,000 people can be a viable candidate for president. While several other current or former mayors are considering campaigns, they hail from iconic cities like Los Angeles, New Orleans, and New York and have records of managing sprawling bureaucracies or navigating crises. Buttigieg has a far more modest record.
He began to draw notice in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, delivering an essay, “A Letter from Flyover Country," that counseled Democrats on how to recover from their defeats that year. He ran unsuccessfully to chair the Democratic National Committee, withdrawing before the vote in 2017. Buttigieg, who is gay, also chided Democrats for being overly focused on the presidency.

White House's practices on security to be probed
WASHINGTON — House Democrats will investigate the White House's security clearance practices and what they call "grave breaches" that gave potentially compromised individuals access to the country's most sensitive secrets.
The investigation, announced by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's chairman, Representative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, is seeking to expose why the White House cleared certain individuals and to close loopholes.
Among those whom the panel plans to scrutinize are former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians; Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who failed to disclose several contacts with foreign officials; and former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who was accused of spousal abuse.
Washington Post
Manafort's lawyers say his misstatements unintentional
WASHINGTON — Paul Manafort's attorneys on Wednesday rebutted allegations the former Trump campaign chairman lied to investigators and broke his plea deal, saying any misstatements he made in special counsel Robert Mueller III's probe of Russian interference in the presidential election were unintentional.
In a redacted version of a 10-page document filed under seal, Manafort's attorneys told a judge "a fair reading" of the government's allegations "does not support the conclusion that Mr. Manafort intentionally provided false information."
Rather, "placed in proper context, much of the evidence presented by [Mueller's office] merely demonstrates a lack of consistency in Mr. Manafort's recollection of certain facts and events. Indeed, many of these events occurred years ago, or during a high-pressure US presidential campaign," which Manafort left under fire.
Prosecutors said they are ready to back up their accusations at a hearing Friday.

Worried About Privacy? Steer Clear of Facebook

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nick Confessore, an investigative reporter, discussed the tech he's using.
You've written a lot about data privacy and the misuse of people's online data. How do you protect your own data privacy in your work?
I'm not a privacy expert, just a normal person who has done some reporting on how tech platforms handle personal data. So the answer is: I protect my privacy as well as I can -- which is not very well.
Most of the ecosystem of mobile phones and apps, as well as the advertising technology that permeates the mobile and desktop web, is designed to extract a large amount of your personal information. The whole thing is effectively unregulated and almost impossible to escape without a fair amount of planning and technical expertise.
I use an iPhone, because Apple has some reasonable tech in place to protect your privacy. (Android phones, running Google's operating system, are voracious and arguably unscrupulous collectors of information about their owners; an Android phone with Chrome open sends your location back to Google about 300 times a day, according to one study.) I've turned off location tracking for almost all of the apps I use, and I've tried to limit what Google apps I have on my iPhone.
For search, I mostly use DuckDuckGo, a privacy-optimized search engine that chooses not to collect or save certain kinds of data about the people who use it. I use a browser plug-in from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital civil rights group, called Privacy Badger, which tells me when a site I visit is letting third parties look over its shoulder at what I'm doing.
Despite my in-house lamentations, The Times uses Gmail for its corporate email services, which means I have both a personal and a business Gmail account. I also use the Chrome browser on a PC desktop, because I found other browsers were less stable. (I'm thinking of going back to Firefox.)
So what do I do? Whatever I can. In my privacy settings, I've turned off -- or "paused" -- all of the Google services associated with my Gmail accounts that track me or collect my data. I never sign into another website or service using my Facebook account, a feature Facebook has used to track its users' browsing activities off the Facebook platform. I've tweaked all the privacy settings on Facebook and other services that I can find.
For all that, I have no doubt that a true privacy expert reading this article will laugh at all the things I'm missing. And that's kind of the point: In the United States, and in some other countries, the deck is stacked against consumers.
Have you changed your use of social media after writing about some of the data practices of Facebook ?
When I started reporting on Big Tech, a lot of the public criticism about social media focused on Twitter, a relatively small platform that happens to be popular among the American political and journalistic elite. Two years later, a lot of the criticism focuses on Facebook and Google -- and Twitter is by far the social media platform I use the most.
That's partly because I don't find the Facebook experience all that engaging or fun. But partly it's for security. Once I started reporting deeply on Facebook, I deleted all Facebook-owned apps from my phone, including Instagram. I don't know exactly who has access to the data those apps collect, but while meeting with confidential sources, I don't want to risk that an app on my phone might be sending Facebook my location.
The social media app I really miss is Instagram. I always had a private account, and I accept requests only from real-life friends and family. So it's an ocean of sanity and genuine relationships compared with Twitter, which is a hell of random angry people. But when I log in -- once or twice a week at most, usually on my wife's phone -- I'm now hyper-conscious that every like, thumb click and scroll may go into my permanent Facebook record.
Is deleting Facebook an effective way to protect privacy?
Not in the slightest.
It may interfere with Facebook's ability to track you as a consumer. But almost every website you visit or app you have on your phone is to some extent tracking where you go and what you do.
Deleting Facebook may not even stop Facebook. Kashmir Hill at Gizmodo has written about "shadow profiles" -- dossiers that Facebook builds about people using information it culls from the inboxes and cellphones of their friends, work colleagues and acquaintances. Facebook may know a lot about you even if you never open a Facebook account.
What are some of the tech tools of the trade for an investigative reporter?
I don't do anything really elaborate. The main thing I do differently is conduct virtually all of my sensitive work communication over Signal, the encrypted messaging app. It's an easy way to have reasonably safe conversations with sources who need protection.
When I write about politics and campaigns, I rely on in-house data tools to query federal data on campaign contributions and expenditures. (Hat tip to Rachel Shorey, Chase Davis, Jeremy Bowers and many other colleagues.) I've also used tools at the National Institute on Money in Politics, which maintains a database that covers state-by-state lobbying and campaign finance. I also love a site called Citizen Audit, which provides searchable copies of the tax returns for nonprofit organizations. It's basically Google for "dark money."
More recently, I've come to rely on LinkedIn. When you're writing about companies, it is an invaluable way to track down former employees who might be potential sources. People at companies will often describe in their LinkedIn profiles particular projects they worked on, products they developed or initiatives that the company conducted -- often information that is otherwise not public.
The most important tool of all? A telescoping back scratcher that I got at a store called Flying Tiger. I keep it in my pencil mug, and it is awesome.
If you could invent a product to help people protect their online privacy, what would it be?
I'm going to answer this one the long way. The United States has no basic consumer privacy law. So every individual has to be in charge of navigating the entire commercial-surveillance-industrial-complex on his or her own. Which is to say, it's practically impossible for any nonexperts to protect their privacy in a meaningful way.
The privacy expert Ashkan Soltani, whom I've quoted in some stories, compares it to ordering a cup of coffee at a Starbucks and being told that the coffee may be loaded with arsenic, but that it's up to you to figure out whether or not the coffee is safe to drink.
I've come to the view that no effective privacy-protection product is really possible without clearer -- and probably more stringent -- laws governing what data companies are allowed to collect and what rights I have to control my own information. If such laws did come into play, it would open the door to interesting private-sector privacy solutions. For example, California recently passed a law allowing consumers to "opt out" of many kinds of online and offline data collection. With such a law in place, new businesses can sell subscription services that would, for a fee, do all the opting out for you.
Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love to use and why?
We're a pretty analog family. Aside from the requisite phones, laptops and iPad, I don't have a lot of gear. Most of the gadgets we do have I don't actually like.
Sonos is a great-sounding speaker with an inexplicably unwieldy user interface that makes me want to throw my phone out the window. (Hey, Sonos, why can't I just play my songs directly from my phone's Music app?) The Nest learning thermostats never seem to actually learn anything. (Also, the Nests give Google the equivalent of a couple of cameras in my home.)
I've shied away from voice-activated speakers like Amazon Echo. I find these devices extremely creepy. For now, the only such device in my home is in my older daughter's room. She really, really wanted a Google Home.
I have a few guitars and a nice big tube amplifier that I never get to turn on, because it's New York, I live in an apartment and I want my neighbors to like me. We cook a lot but don't have an Instant Pot. Don't @ me.

Texto completo: They say a picture is worth a thousand words. We’ll have to make do with 600 or so.
The picture in question -- the video, actually -- electrified social media over the weekend. In it, a white high school boy wearing a "Make America Great Again" cap, confronts an older Native American man who is beating a ceremonial drum and singing a Native song. The encounter took place Friday on the National Mall. The man was there as part of the Indigenous Peoples March. The boy was with a group from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky that was participating in the "March For Life" anti-abortion rally.
The man sings. The boy smirks. Some of his classmates mock the Native man. Someone yells, "Build the wall!" And there was, for many of us, something starkly symbolic in all of it, something that spoke of American fracture.
Yes, the story grew more complicated as details emerged over the weekend. It turns out the students had been drawn to the spot by a small group of black protesters -- so-called "Black Hebrew Israelites" -- using their First Amendment rights to curse and insult essentially everyone who was not them, including Catholics, whites, Native Americans and, at one point, a black person who disdained their toxic beliefs.
The students began what they described as a school spirit chant to drown out the black men. Tensions were high. And into this cauldron of ideology and identity stepped Nathan Phillips, a 64-year-old elder of the Omaha people and a Vietnam veteran. His aim in walking through the crowd, he said, was to settle things down. As he told The New York Times, "I stepped in between to pray."
The crowd, he said, parted to let him through. All except for the boy, since identified as Nick Sandmann, a junior. Phillips said the boy blocked him when he moved left. When he moved right, Sandmann did the same.
In a written statement, the boy denied blocking Phillips. "To be honest," he wrote, "I was startled and confused as to why he had approached me." But the boy in that video, smirking, trying not to laugh, is not startled or confused. He looks, rather, entitled and smug.
Indeed, what gave the image its initial, visceral power was the sense that his expression was one we have seen before. It was on the face of an SS man as he cut off a rabbi's beard on a Warsaw street, on the face of an Alabama state trooper waiting at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Heck, it was on the face of a hulking high school boy as he prepared to dunk a smaller kid's head into the toilet. It was the eternal expression of the bully at the head of a mob.
Now here it was on this boy, using his First Amendment right to wear a hat many of us consider the functional equivalent of a pointy white hood, as he faced down a child of the people who named the Mississippi River and left the first footprints in the virgin soil of the Blue Ridge Mountains. All while someone yelled about building a wall. And if the story has grown more complicated, what hasn't changed is the sense that those images capture a nation at the breaking point.
As it happens, this story unfolded over the weekend we set aside to honor Martin Luther King, the confrontation itself occurring near the spot where he said, "I have a dream." That, of course, was on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a monument to the president who led this country through a war in which 2 percent of the population -- the modern equivalent would be over 66 million people -- died fighting over the meaning of freedom.
And Nathan Phillips' prayer? It was for unity, he said.

Texto completo: David Brooks is the pre-eminent voice of conservative patricians. He strains to find reason in unreasonable people, and his political analyses typically apportion blame to both sides.
So it was on the PBS NewsHour recently when the New York Times columnist was asked about the furious debate over President Trump's decision to close large parts of the federal government until Democrats relent and hand him billions for a wall on the Mexico border a victory he can brag about.
To many of us, Trump made a petulant, unilateral decision to shut down government to force Democrats to capitulate, lest he suffer the wrath of far-right commentators like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh, which to Trump is apparently worse than harming millions of Americans.
It's seemed clear that the wall had little to do with underlying immigration policy, as former George W. Bush speech-writer David Frum wrote in The Atlantic: "Trump has never wanted a solution. He has wanted a divisive issue and a personal monument."
But in Brooks' view, reasonable politicians from both sides have been negotiating border security in good faith. It's that darn Nancy Pelosi, the inflexible House Speaker, who shares something approximating equal blame with Trump.
"We now have two towers of ego who can't give," Brooks said, referring to Trump and Pelosi. So, because Pelosi won't cave to the most disingenuous, untrustworthy politician in modern American history, she is the co-villain.
Brooks' analysis illustrates one of three themes I think the border wall debate exemplifies about how the Trump presidency perseveres, and they are connected to one another.
The first is the media conundrum of "false equivalency," which contributed mightily to Trump's victory and has been rampant since.
For all of Trump's whining about fake news and his continual running to Fox News to be coddled, the mainstream media has been playing by fairness and balance standards that seem outdated, even quaint, in Trump's era of pathological lies. Frank Bruni, another New York Times columnist, recently cited a Harvard analysis that found Trump got far more positive coverage from the nation's most influential newspapers and major newscasts than did Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. Bruni's column had the chilling headline: "Will the media be Trump's accomplice again?" in 2020.
Bruni wrote: "We interpreted fairness as a similarly apportioned mix of complimentary and derogatory stories, no matter how different one contender's qualifications, accomplishments and liabilities were from another's. If we were going to pile on Trump, we had to pile on Clinton or rather, keep piling on her. And in this quest for a theoretical fairness and balance, journalists are still overcompensating."
That's the definition of false equivalency.
So, even if the media falls into the equivalency trap on the border wall and government shutdown, why does Trump choose to gin up such a divisive spectacle?
That's the second theme. More than any politician I can recall, Trump has a knack for changing the subject. He's mastered the politics of distraction.
Whatever political price Trump is paying for the shutdown, it is likely less than allowing news cycles to be even more dominated by revelations about his connections to Russia.
Almost daily, some investigative report sheds new and troubling light on Trump's relations, whether it's the story that the FBI investigated the possibility Trump was acting as a Russian agent, or another that he sought to prevent anyone from learning the substance of his buddy-buddy conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Perhaps Trump correctly reasons it is better to change the subject and have headlines focus on the pain and suffering of 800,000 federal workers missing paychecks than to allow the drip-drip or rather gush-gush of revelations about Russia to dominate newscasts, front pages and websites.
Besides, it once again shows his base of supporters that he's a fighter, even if the fight is a charade of his own making.
His GOP allies enable him, pretending Russia is a non-story.
Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texan who has joined fellow Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham as a prominent Trump critic-turned-sycophant, claimed recently that most voters do not care about Trump and Russia.
"There is an incredible divide between Washington and the rest of the country," Cruz told NBC's "Meet the Press." "When it comes to (special counsel) Bob Mueller and the Russia investigation, the mainstream media, Washington, is obsessed with it. And when you get outside the Beltway, I don't find anybody concerned with this at all."
Once again, change the subject and avoid the substance.
But then, why don't Trump voters seem to care?
During my adult life the Republican Party has stood primarily for two things protecting white male economic and social privilege and posturing as the political home for patriots, the kind of folks who presumably want a strong defense against avowed enemies like Russia.
I recall the "My Country Right or Wrong" and "America, Love It or Leave It" signs and bumper stickers. Their owners were always quick to tell us that they, not we, were the true patriots.
So how is it that when Russia attacks us not with bombs but with technology Trump's supporters are said not to care?
That brings me to the third recurrent theme in this month-long build-the-wall spectacle.
And it's this: Many Trump supporters overlook his immorality and lies not because of what he is accomplishing for them, but because they like how he tries to hurt the rest of us. As long as those city types with their fancy degrees and credentials are suffering, we're good. Is that it?
Take the 38-year-old Florida prison employee working without a paycheck, who told the New York Times she was rethinking her Trump support.
"I voted for him, and he's the one who's doing this. I thought he was going to do good things. He's not hurting the people he needs to be hurting."
Maybe in 2020, "Make America Great Again" should make way for "Trump He Hurts Those I Want Hurt."
In his world, it's the new American way. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund ; Paul Fanlund is editor and publisher of The Capital Times

House votes to bar Trump from exiting NATO

Texto completo: The House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday night to block President Trump from spending any federal money to withdraw from NATO, and to set a formal policy that the U.S. will "remain a member in good standing."

“This branch of government fully supports the alliance, the collective defense of our allies, and peace across the North Atlantic region,” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said during a floor debate.

Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., introduced the NATO Support Act last week, just days after a New York Times report said President Trump has “privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.”

The legislation reiterates the support of Congress for NATO and denounces any effort to withdraw or “indirectly withdraw” through a cut in U.S. commitments to the alliance. It would also deny funding to implement such a decision by the president.

“NATO is our greatest strategic advantage, one built over time and at great sacrifice,” Engel said. “We simply cannot cede such an advantage. Past and future generations alike would never forgive the squandering of something so precious.”

President Trump has jolted western allies with his various criticisms of the alliance, dating back to the campaign trail, when he told reporters that NATO members couldn’t assume that the United States would defend them from an attack.

“If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes,” he said, He didn’t endorse Article V of the treaty — the provision that establishes that NATO members will defend each other if attacked — until the following year.

“Certainly, we are there to protect,” Trump said in June of 2017.

Panetta, the bill’s author, faulted Trump for seeding such misgivings.

"The mutual defense pledge is why NATO has been the most successful military alliance in history,” he said. “It is an interdependency that has stood as a sturdy, strong, and sound anchor for peace that has prevented new world wars, fostered western prosperity, and advanced democratic governance.”

Trump’s administration has argued that his policies, especially the insistence on increased defense spending by European nations, has fortified the alliance, not weakened it.

“We’ve rebuilt NATO in important ways already,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters after his trip to the NATO Foreign Minister summit in December. “NATO is a far stronger organization as a result of the Trump administration than it was for the previous decade, I can assure you. And the 28 European ministers who were there with me today know that too.”

The top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee backed Panetta’s effort, but he echoed the president’s critique of European allies.

“An alliance of mutual defense is only as strong as each country's commitment to its spending goals,” Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on the floor. “Statements of support like this bill are important in affirming our relationships around the world. But actions speak louder than words. No statement about the importance of NATO speaks as loudly as a tangible commitment each country makes to ensuring the strength of the alliance.”

Panetta also called for spending increases, but sharpened the rebuke of Trump.

“NATO is not — is not — a transactional relationship,” the California Democrat said. “Our sole focus can’t just be on who pays and who gets what. Being a part of NATO is not like being a part of a country club . . . NATO is instrumental from setting us apart from Russia. Why? We have allies who will stand by us. Russia doesn't."

Chief Justice John Roberts right to push back against Trump, defend judiciary

Texto completo: In November, a federal judge in San Francisco struck down President Trump’s attempt to limit asylum-seekers to legal points of entry. Trump complained about the action of “an Obama Judge.”
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts criticized Trump, saying America does not have “Obama judges or Trump judges . . . What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”
In December, a federal judge in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”). The judge had been appointed by President George W. Bush. Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut, said that “Republicans just blew up our health care system.” Press comments have portrayed the judge’s ruling as political and characterized the Fifth Circuit (comprised of Southern states), which will hear any appeal, that way as well.
Will Chief Justice Roberts be even-handed now and criticize those calling the federal court decision in Texas the act of Republicans? Perhaps he regrets having entered this forum in the first place. Roberts has challenged Trump in a sport at which Trump excels. When federal District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii ruled against the Trump travel ban (called the “Muslim ban” by its detractors), Trump was fulsome in criticizing the judge as political because President Obama had appointed him. Trump called the San Diego judge hearing the case against Trump University biased because the Indiana-born Judge’s parents were from Mexico — making at least two offensive leaps that a judge who was the son of Mexican immigrants would be prejudiced against Trump due to Trump’s comments on Mexicans, and that the prejudice would be so great it would affect the judge’s impartiality in a matter totally unrelated to Mexico or immigration.
Federal judges are called to make decisions based on the law, not their own policy preferences. President Trump and Senator Murphy have done much harm in blurring that distinction.
This is not to say federal judges are identical. Litigants choose courts to file suits where they have the best chance of winning. Trump noted the “Obama Judge” was in San Francisco, within the liberal-leaning 9th Circuit that often rules against him. After the Obamacare ruling, the New York Times observed that “conservative lawyers are known to choose [the federal court in Texas] to file cases.” Neither practice is improper, so long as the court decision itself is based on nonpolitical grounds.
When Trump opponents win at the trial court level, they then try to get the court to apply its ruling to the entire country. That’s what the federal judge in San Francisco did, blocking Trump’s asylum policy nationwide. The federal judge in Texas has not yet given national application to his order striking down Obamacare. If he does, expect Democratic politicians who praised the San Francisco judge’s nationwide order to be outraged by the Texas judge doing the same thing, and expect Trump to praise the judge’s wisdom.
The judiciary interprets laws; it has no power to make laws. Judges are fairly criticized when their legal interpretation seems to create new law that Congress or state legislatures never intended. But Murphy and Trump labeling judges based on which president appointed them goes far beyond fair criticism. This kind of attack, if repeated often enough, will eventually impede the vital function courts perform in our constitutional scheme. A calumny often repeated sometimes sticks. When the law compels a politically unpopular outcome in a case, Americans should hope the judge ignores the political and does what’s right. That’s especially important to those who care deeply about civil liberties. I doubt the Bill of Rights’ protections for criminals would be approved in a popular referendum today. Segregated schools were the result of popular majority votes. America loses something precious if the third branch, fearful of being labeled political, begins to act in a political way.

Skating, Which Knows Scandal, Confronts Something Grimmer

Texto completo: The United States figure skating championships begin Thursday in Detroit, 25 years after Nancy Kerrigan was attacked there by associates of Tonya Harding.
It is a sport where drama and scandal, on the ice and off, are as commonplace as sequins. The outrageous and bumbling clubbing of Kerrigan on Jan. 6, 1994, made skating more popular than it has ever been. Television ratings soared, along with skaters' paychecks. Last year, the mockumentary "I, Tonya" even won an Academy Award for best supporting actress.
But skating's attraction has long ebbed outside of the Olympics. And this year's American championships return to Detroit at a grim moment, following the apparent suicide of a former star who had been suspended by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, an organization whose primary mission is to investigate accusations of sexual misconduct.
John Coughlin, 33, won American pairs titles in 2011 and 2012 and, at the time of his death on Friday in Kansas City, Mo., he held a leading advocacy position as the chairman of the athletes commission of the International Skating Union, the sport's world governing body.
"My wonderful, strong, amazingly compassionate brother John Coughlin took his own life earlier today," his sister, Angela Laune, wrote in a Facebook post on Friday night.
Coughlin's story reflects both an enhanced effort to construct a safety net to protect athletes against sexual impropriety and the imperfections that remain in that web, not just in figure skating, but in every sport.
By all accounts, Coughlin was well liked in the sport as a competitor, coach and commentator. Johnny Weir, the skating commentator and a two-time Olympian, wrote on Twitter that Coughlin "was a person who was talented, had an incredible laugh & would go out of his way to cheer someone up."
But troubling concerns had surfaced recently about Coughlin, made more disquieting by the fact that he was supposed to be an international voice for skaters' rights.
Last Thursday, Coughlin was given an "interim suspension" by SafeSport, which meant he could not be involved in skating until accusations against him were resolved.
On Sunday, a person with knowledge of the Coughlin case, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that more than one skater had accused him of sexual misconduct that went beyond harassment. Also on Sunday, USA Today reported that two complaints against Coughlin involved minors.
U.S. Figure Skating, the national governing body, has said little, beyond expressing shock and condolences. Daniel Hill, a spokesman for SafeSport, said on Sunday that "the center has a charter to put an end to sexual misconduct in the Olympic movement, and we have exclusive authority to investigate those cases."
Hill was speaking in general terms and not specifically about Coughlin. Referring to sanctions against individuals, Hill said, "We will only use those if there are concerns and we believe individuals need to be kept safe now."
In an interview with USA Today on Jan. 7, Coughlin called accusations against him "unfounded" and stated, correctly, that a preliminary sanction "in no way constitutes a finding by SafeSport or that there is any merit to the allegation."
The U.S. Center for SafeSport was created by the United States Olympic Committee in 2017, after allegations of sexual abuse were repeatedly made in such sports as gymnastics and swimming. Reaction to SafeSport's effort to curb sexual misconduct in figure skating has been mixed and complicated.
"Is SafeSport cleaning up the sport? I'd have to say my answer, generally speaking, is yes," said Craig Maurizi, a longtime coach and the director of figure skating at the Ice House training center in Hackensack, N.J., said on Sunday. "I think the mechanism is making people think twice before they act."
At the same time, Maurizi criticized SafeSport for the manner in which it was adjudicating a high-profile case involving him that has been going on for two decades.
In 1999, in an investigative report in The New York Times, Maurizi accused a former coaching colleague, Richard Callaghan, of engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct with Maurizi when Maurizi was 15 and a skating student of Callaghan's. Later, Maurizi said, Callaghan abused his position of authority to initiate a full sexual relationship when Maurizi was 18 that lasted, on and off, for years.
Callaghan, who with Maurizi assisting, coached Tara Lipinski to an Olympic gold medal in 1998, vehemently denied in the Times story that he had ever had sex with Maurizi or that he had engaged in improper behavior.
Maurizi filed a complaint with U.S. Figure Skating in 1999, but it was dismissed because it had not been filed within the required 60 days of the alleged improper conduct. On Jan. 31, 2018, Maurizi refiled his grievance, this time with SafeSport, which gave Callaghan a provisional suspension in March 2018. At the time of the suspension, Callaghan told ABC News: "That's 19 or 20 years ago. I have nothing to say."
Meanwhile, it is now nearly a year after Maurizi's complaint was resubmitted, but the case has yet to be fully resolved.
"Are they dragging their feet?" Maurizi said of SafeSport. "Absolutely."
SafeSport says it resolves cases as quickly as possible, but acknowledges a backlog from being underfunded and understaffed. A three-year grant from the Justice Department, worth $2.2 million, is intended for education and prevention programs and cannot be used to reduce the case backlog or hire investigators, Hill said.
Maurizi, whose wife, Tara Modlin, was Coughlin's agent, also questioned whether due process was being fairly granted to all parties in cases investigated by SafeSport. "It's such mixed emotions and mixed feelings, given the situation with my friend who felt he didn't have due process and was not given an opportunity to voice his side," Maurizi said of Coughlin.
An interim suspension is not a final disposition of a case but a step taken to prevent possible further harm to athletes until an investigation is concluded, said Hill, the SafeSport spokesman.
He said that an interim suspension "is best practice in this field, not just what we think but what most people think needs to be done in these type of matters, especially when you're dealing with minors." He added, "Our mission requires us to protect athletes."
The U.S.O.C. said it had authorized $6.2 million for SafeSport in 2019 (the center's total budget is about $10 million). Five additional investigators are to be added soon to the approximately 20 already employed and a ramped-up staff of 50 is expected within the next year and a half, Hill said. Eventually, he said, the center's budget is expected to grow to $25 million or more.
Meanwhile, according to The Associated Press, an average of 85 complaints continue to be filed with SafeSport each month.
Sara Hirshland, the chief executive of the U.S.O.C., said in an interview with The Times last week that "there is no doubt that the capacity of the center is not where it needs to be to handle the volume."

Texto completo: Now that we're a few weeks into 2019, it's time to plan the year. Let's get the tough stuff out of the way first: household expenses. When was the last time you reviewed them?
Because I always want you to be thinking about retirement security, no matter your age or financial circumstances, let me share some insights gained over 25 years of working with the high net worth and their families.
First, everyone, no matter how rich or poor, needs to review expenses. As Paul Sullivan of The New York Times wrote last week in "Deciding How to Decide': Even the Rich Need Advice on Budgeting": "If you're worried about your credit card bills from the holidays, you're not alone: Even the wealthiest Americans, who have little chance of running out of money, are concerned about their spending."
Second, January is the best time to review expenses. Last year's spending is complete. You have to prepare for filing your 2018 tax return. And it's the start of a fresh new year.
Third, the review will give you the ammunition you need to plan not only this year, but also the future. You'll be able to see where money has gone over the past year, and you'll be able to set up rules to follow for this year and the future.
By rules, I mean you will be able to judge, by looking at last year, how you want to spend your money this year. A simple but not too exciting example is planning to pay for the annual homeowners insurance bill when it comes due later in the year. Or equally as important can be planning your summer vacation. In either case, the rules should allow you to budget for what you want or need in your life, based on what you can afford.
Basically, I'm talking about seeing your household as a cash flow business that requires you to know what expenses are coming up and how you will pay for them. If you have not attempted this sort of exercise, especially if you are living paycheck to paycheck, there are tools that can help.
One program that I found of interest is YNAB at www.youneedabudget.com. I like the four rules and the process beyond using a budget to avoid the risk of running out of money before the next paycheck comes in: Rule 1: Give every dollar a job (be intentional about what you want your money to do for you BEFORE you spend it).
Rule 2: Embrace your true expenses (decide what you want your money to do for you and put some of it aside to pay for large expenses in the future).
Rule 3: Roll with the punches (change the budget when you need to).
Rule 4: Age your money (spend money you earned at least a month ago).
Awareness is the key. The reason is simple: Knowledge is power. In fact, it's more than power it's control. Out of all of the factors that affect financial security, from the stock market, to choosing investments wisely, to knowing when to sell, to finding the right investment adviser, there is one thing that you can control: how you spend money and what you want your money to do for you.
Let me add two more insights from billionaire investor Warren Buffett that also apply to money: "You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong." To me, that means your system does not have to be perfect. And, "Money can't change how many people love you or how healthy you are." Money does not buy health or happiness.
Remember that no matter how big or small your budget is, managing your expenses is an essential first step to financial independence and retirement security. Julie Jason, JD, LLM, a personal money manager (Jackson, Grant of Stamford, Conn.) and author, welcomes

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Kamala Harris, a first-term senator and former California attorney general known for her rigorous questioning of President Donald Trump's nominees, entered the Democratic presidential race on Monday. Vowing to "bring our voices together," Harris would be the first woman to hold the presidency and the second African-American if she succeeds.
Harris, who grew up in Oakland, California, and is a daughter of parents from Jamaica and India, is one of the earliest high-profile Democrats to join what is expected to be a crowded field. She made her long anticipated announcement on ABC's "Good Morning America."
"I am running for president of the United States," she said. "And I'm very excited about it."
The 54-year old portrayed herself as a fighter for justice, decency and equality in a video distributed by her campaign as she announced her bid. "They're the values we as Americans cherish, and they're all on the line now," Harris says in the video . "The future of our country depends on you and millions of others lifting our voices to fight for our American values."
On ABC, she cited her years as a prosecutor in asserting: "My entire career has been focused on keeping people safe. It is probably one of the things that motivates me more than anything else."
Harris launched her presidential as the nation observes what would have been the 90th birthday of the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The timing was a clear signal that the California senator- who has joked that she had a "stroller's-eye view" of the civil rights movement because her parents wheeled her and her sister Maya to protests - sees herself as another leader in that fight.
She abandoned the formality of launching an exploratory committee, instead going all in on a presidential bid.
She plans a formal campaign launch in Oakland on Jan. 27. The campaign will be based in Baltimore, with a second office in Oakland.
Harris joins what is expected to be a wide-open race for the Democratic presidential nomination. There's no apparent front-runner at this early stage and Harris will face off against several Senate colleagues.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have both launched exploratory committees. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are also looking at the race.
If Booker enters the race, he and Harris could face a fierce competition for support from black voters.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the 2016 Democratic nomination, is also considering a campaign. Several other Democrats have already declared their intentions, including former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and former Obama administration housing chief Julian Castro.
Harris launches her campaign fresh off of a tour to promote her latest memoir, "The Truths We Hold," which was widely seen as a stage-setter for a presidential bid.
She is already planning her first trip to an early primary state as a declared candidate. On Friday, Harris will travel to South Carolina to attend the Pink Ice Gala in Columbia, which is hosted by a South Carolina chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which Harris pledged as an undergraduate student at Howard University. The sorority, founded more than 100 years ago, is a stronghold in the African-American community.
South Carolina, where black voters make up a large share of the Democratic electorate, is likely to figure heavily into Harris's prospects. And early voting in Harris's home state of California will overlap with the traditional early nominating contests, which could give Harris a boost.
Harris's campaign team is already taking shape and includes several veterans of Democratic politics.
Juan Rodriguez, who ran Harris's 2016 Senate campaign, will manage her presidential bid. Her sister, Maya Harris, a former top adviser to Hillary Clinton, will be the campaign chair. The veteran campaign finance lawyer Marc Elias will serve as the Harris campaign's general counsel, and Angelique Cannon, who worked for Clinton's 2016 campaign, will serve as national finance director. David Huynh, who was Clinton's director of delegate operations in 2016, will serve as a senior adviser. Lily Adams, a Clinton campaign alum who has worked as Harris's spokeswoman, will be communications director.
Her staff says she plans to reject the assistance of a super PAC, as well as corporate PAC money. She's invested heavily in cultivating a digital, small-dollar donor network before her presidential bid.
Before her 2016 victory in the Senate race, Harris made her career in law enforcement. She served as the district attorney in San Francisco before she was elected to serve as attorney general.
Harris is likely to face questions about her law enforcement record, particularly after the Black Lives Matter movement and activists across the country pushed for a criminal justice overhaul. Harris's prosecutorial record has recently come under new scrutiny after a blistering opinion piece in The New York Times criticized her repeated claim that she was a "progressive prosecutor," focused on changing a broken criminal justice system from within.
Harris addressed her law enforcement background in her book. She argued it was a "false choice" to decide between supporting the police and advocating for greater scrutiny of law enforcement.
She "knew that there was an important role on the inside, sitting at the table where the decisions were being made," she wrote. "When activists came marching and banging on the doors, I wanted to be on the other side to let them in."
Harris supported legislation that passed the Senate last year that overhauled the criminal justice system, particularly when it comes to sentencing rules.
Harris is framing her campaign through her courtroom experience. The theme of her nascent campaign is "Kamala Harris, for the people," the same words she spoke as a prosecutor, trying a case in the courtroom.

Texto completo: Our topic for today: three stories and a letter.
The stories all made recent headlines. The first was about the state of Florida posthumously pardoning the Groveland Four, a group of African-American men who suffered torture, prison and murder after being falsely accused of raping a white woman in 1949.
The second concerns broad Republican condemnation of one of their own, Rep. Steve King, for an interview with the New York Times in which he questioned why the terms "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" should be considered offensive.
The third involves a directive - since rescinded - NBC News sent its writers, reporters and anchors about King's words. "Be careful to avoid characterizing (King's) remarks as racist," it said, suggesting that the remarks instead be described as 'what many are calling racist'."
As for the letter: It was written by Martin Luther King Jr., whose 90th birthday the nation commemorates today. King famously penned the epistle from a jail cell in Birmingham in response to a group of white clergymen, eight moderate, principled men, who had condemned as "unwise and untimely" his demonstrations against segregation in their city.
One passage of King's response seems especially apropos to this moment. In it, he confessed that he had become "gravely disappointed with the white moderate." Too often, he said, they were "more devoted to 'order' than to justice," and preferred "a negative peace, which is the absence of tension to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice."
Added King: "Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will."
Make no mistake: King well knew that all over the South, liberal white kids were risking their lives for black freedom. He was calling out other white people, often older, more moderate white people like those eight men, for the tepidness and flaccidity of their commitment to racial reconciliation. This was 1963, but as the stories above suggest, that problem endures.
It is possible, for instance, to celebrate that Florida has finally done right by the Groveland Four - and yet, to also be disgusted that it takes 70 years for the state to belatedly admit its crimes and deliver some small measure of delayed "justice."
It is possible to consider the GOP's condemnation of Steve King all well and fine, yet also a little arbitrary and affected given that King has a history of racist rhetoric that passed without his party seeming to much notice or care - and that the GOP itself has a long record of thinly-veiled racism as obvious as the writing on Barack Obama's birth certificate.
It is possible to concede that NBC has an interest in ensuring its people remain disinterested observers of events they report, yet feel that in asking them to refrain from calling obvious racism obvious racism, the network doesn't embody journalistic rigor so much as it does white people's too-frequent refusal to call out such racism even when it's right in front of them.
We may safely assume most NBC executives, Republican lawmakers and Florida officials would say - and probably believe - all the right things if you asked about their commitment to racial justice. Yet given a chance to put force behind that commitment, they failed. In Florida's case, they failed for seven decades.
"The ultimate tragedy," King once said, "is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people." He was right.
If you are good, yet silent, maybe you're not really as good as you think.

Fire destroys city's iconic Mrs. B's

Texto completo: Margaret Boyd was getting ready for work when firefighters knocked at her door at 4 a.m. to let her know there would be no work to go to — her restaurant, Mrs. B's Home Cooking, was destroyed by fire.
The cause, though not officially declared by the Montgomery Fire Department, was likely electrical, Boyd said. She was told the fire originated early Sunday in the back of the restaurant, which was nestled inside an old home.
The home, which Boyd rented, is a loss. The equipment inside, which she did own, was destroyed, too.
"There's nothing left," Boyd said. "I'll have to buy all new equipment."
Hours later, the smell of char and destruction lingered in the air surrounding the iconic west Montgomery restaurant on Cullman Street that has been recognized nationally for its southern specialties and homey vibe.
The first call to emergency officials came about 2:30 a.m., fire Capt. Jason Cupps said. 10 units responded, he said, about 25-30 firefighters. The winds were a concern, increasing the chance of the flames spreading houses close by.
"Crews initially made an interior attack and a second alarm was called shortly after," Montgomery Fire Capt. Jason Cupps said. "Crews faced a fire load that was fueled by heavy winds from the north. At the time of the fire, the structure was considered to be unoccupied with no civilians found and no reports of injuries of any firefighters."
Opened nearly 15 years ago, Boyd and her husband started the business after first selling BBQ plates from their driveway. She outgrew that endeavor, and was discussing moving to a new location in October, because she was running out of space at the Cullman Street location. Located across from Maxwell Air Force Base, the restaurant was a popular spot among service members, city leaders and travelers to Montgomery.
In May, Mrs. B's made its way into a New York Times article, after a reporter tasked with touring 52 places around the world made her way to Montgomery and was advised by a cab driver to go to Mrs. B's.
"It's tough," Boyd said about the loss.
She is trying to keep her head up. And, she is also thinking about the future.
"I'm currently talking to someone about finding a new location," she said Sunday afternoon.
At the single-story house, painted blue in the front and yellow in the back, visitors immediately encountered a mountain of military memorabilia. The front porch had the flags of each branch, and the walls were lined with photos of service members.
One wall was dedicated to her husband's time serving in Vietnam, as a member of the Army. Another was dedicated to various family members who served. Pictures of guests lined another wall.

Elite School in Uproar Over Students in Blackface

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
Two white girls in blackface grunted and swung their arms like apes. They jumped up and down to music playing in the background, moving in front of a camera, sneering as a third girl recorded them.
The six-second video snippet was recorded about two and half years ago, but it resurfaced this month, thrusting Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn, one of New York City's elite private schools, into the national conversation about racism.
On Friday, hundreds of Poly Prep students, dressed in black, walked out of an assembly, filtered into the hallways and staged an hour-and-a-half sit-in, which was first reported by the Polygon, the student newspaper.
That same day, on the eve of the holiday weekend honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the video of the Poly Prep students was lumped into a montage of other imagery that swept across social media: a viral video from the University of Oklahoma of a female student with her face painted black and using what sounded like a racial slur, and video of white male students wearing "Make America Great Again" hats who had encountered a Native American veteran of the Vietnam War outside the Lincoln Memorial last Friday. A longer version of that video posted over the weekend led to divergent views about what had actually taken place.
By Saturday, the Poly Prep video had gone viral with the help of an article from The Daily News. On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio weighed in. "Poly Prep has some real explaining to do. And what's absolutely clear is that a conversation about racism at the school is long overdue," Mr. de Blasio said on Twitter.
"On the King holiday weekend, we are now dealing with blatant racism of a younger generation," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose two daughters are alumnae of Poly Prep. "They've been emboldened."
He added, "We have a problem."
Jennifer Slomack, a spokeswoman for Poly Prep, confirmed that one of the students involved in the video is no longer at the school, while the other two are. All three students were in sixth grade when the video was made.
Ms. Slomack declined to comment further on the students, citing privacy laws.
"We do not tolerate racism or prejudice in our school or in our communities," she said in a statement. "We took immediate action as soon as we learned of a highly offensive video, taken years ago, being circulated on our campus. It was an egregious violation of our community values and code of conduct."
Neither of the two students still at the school had been disciplined.
On social media, many critics said that institutions frequently fail to take appropriate disciplinary action regarding these episodes.
At the University of Oklahoma, school officials suggested that an apology from the young woman in blackface and another student could be the extent of punishment. The gesture will fall significantly short of the school disciplinary action against two students who led a racist chant and were expelled in 2015.
Poly Prep is known for its competitive sports program and sprawling, collegiate campus in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. The lower school is in Park Slope. Notable alumni include Joakim Noah, an N.B.A. player, and Representative Max Rose, Democrat of New York.
New York City's private schools are overwhelmingly wealthy and white, and are increasingly becoming part of the public dialogue about segregation as the city moves to integrate public schools.
"We should not view this incident of white girls in blackface gyrating as apes in isolation," said David E. Kirkland, the executive director of the Metropolitan Center for Research on Equity and the Transformation of Schools at New York University. "The video perpetuates the sense that black bodies don't belong in our schools."
About 39 percent of the 1,083 students in kindergarten through 12th grade at Poly Prep identify as "people of color," according to data the school provided to The New York Times.
Current and former black students described a culture of intolerance, even as the school promoted diversity. For some, the video was the latest in a string of slights.
"I would like to say I was disappointed," said Jeovanna deShong-Connor, a senior who is co-president of the student group Umoja, which organized the demonstration on Friday. "But I have been hearing hateful speech since I was a freshman."
She added, "I felt it was my responsibility, our responsibility as the senior class to really do something."
The events unfolded over a week. On Jan. 11, a freshman posted the video on a private website for students, according to the male student's mother, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
She said he felt that taking it to the school authorities would not get the same results as making the video public to students. "I'm proud of him for what he did. When you say, 'See something, do something about it?' That's what he did," she said.
The mother said her son has not received paperwork for registration for next year as other students have. "He just wanted to speak up. Now, he's the bad guy," the mother said, crying. "I'm just worried for his future."
The school responded to the episode with a letter to parents and students that members of Umoja felt was tone-deaf because it emphasized that the distribution of the video violated the school's code of conduct. "It came out like the sharing of the video was worse than the content of the video," said Talisha Ward, also a senior and co-president of the student group.
The Monday after the video was posted, school administrators began taking steps to talk to students and faculty members about the video and racism in general through special assemblies and one-on-one conversations. At one gathering, a dean explicitly called the video "racist," Ms. Ward, 17, said. But some students felt that the overall student body did not understand the gravity of the problem. As a result, students began planning what would become Friday's demonstration.
Parents of one of the students in the video said they were disappointed in how the school had handled the situation.
They said they did not know the video existed until Jan. 11. Afterward, they said, they met with a dean at the school, and later that night, the student began writing an apology, which her parents shared with The New York Times. They said their daughter wants to address her fellow students to make amends.
"They were playing with makeup. Typical 12-year-olds. They were messing around with the makeup. They mixed it all up and packed it on their faces," said the teenager's mother, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Her father said he had asked his daughter, "Did you know what blackface was at the time? She truthfully told me, 'No."'
The video was first circulated among classmates when the student was in seventh grade, and she then recognized that it was offensive and asked people to delete it, her parents said.
"I myself cannot look at this video without being disgusted with my actions and my ignorance at that time," the student wrote. "Which is why I understand your anger. This email is not to tell you that you can't feel that way, I just wanted to help people understand how sorry I am for any offense this has caused."
The teenager's parents said she had been keeping a low profile and had been eating lunch in the dean's office to avoid confrontations.
Ms. Ward said she did not know for sure who the students were in the video because they were in blackface and were younger than her. "But I'm going to school with them. These kind of people are in our hallways and in our classrooms," she said, adding: "I think it's good that there's a citywide conversation. It's good that the video is going viral. We want the girls to know that their actions have consequences. Maybe this is some form of justice."

Texto completo: It's often been said that "culture eats strategy for breakfast."
The notion is that the belief system — or core operating principles — of an organization are what matters most at the ground level.
These core beliefs guide everyday decision-making, behavior and responses to challenges. Clearly defined core values permeate every corner of a company, removing the burden of leaders to intervene constantly and allowing empowered team members a road map for high achievement.
Having studied high-performing cultures for more than two-decades, as well as building five companies of my own, I've discovered the 14 core beliefs of the highest performing teams:
1. Play like you want to be remembered. Pursue big things that move the world and leave a mark, or simply don't do them. Think and act like you're making history, and in turn you will.
2. Don't wait. Take initiative; leap into action. Don't wait for direction, permission, or a final directive to move forward. We are all responsible to initiate the change we seek.
3. Compress time. Cultivate speed, reduce cycles, learn and grow faster, deliver freakish response times, demonstrate fire department urgency. If capital was the most valuable asset in the past, today speed carries the day.
4. Obey the No A-hole Rule. Lift others up instead of cutting them down. Support instead of destroy. Double down on humility and leave the ego on the sidelines. Positivity and teamwork drive performance. Life's just too short for grumpy jerks.
5. Be the DaVinci of your craft. Hold yourself and each other to the absolute highest standards, stretch for more, create and deliver your body of work with artistry.
6. Out-hustle by a full decimal point. You may fall short on talent or skill or resources, but never get out-hustled. Your grit must be untamable.
7. Figure it out. There's always a way ... find it. Unwilling to accept norms or limits, seek the unexpected, challenge assumptions, defy traditions.
8. Guzzle truth serum. Confront the brutal facts, deliver honest feedback, tell it straight, and skip the BS.
9. Use every drop of toothpaste. Eliminate waste, maximize your resources, drive leverage.
10. Commit to 5X'ing. Deliver 5X the value you extract for your company, clients, partners, community, industry, and planet. Leave it 5X better than you found it.
11. Own the outcomes. You're accountable for results, plain and simple. Don't whine or make excuses. Take full responsibility for what you deliver.
12. Put yourself out of business. Play up, constantly learning, adapt fast, and make elevating yourself a core job responsibility. Remain dissatisfied. Cultivate an insatiable appetite for growth and change and a deep disdain for the status quo.
13. Spike the ball. Put points on the board, finish strong, have fun, and savor the wins.
14. Don't forget the dinner mint. Surprise and delight, add something extra to what's expected.
Business today is too complicated and fast to provide every team member a detailed operating manual for success. Instead, embrace these 14 core beliefs and your organization will be well on the way to mastery in this modern era of intense competition, digitization, and disruption. Let these rules serve as a road map to embrace change, drive innovation, better serve customers, and delight your bottom line.

Texto completo: A railroad transfer station that will offer cheaper shipping costs for central Iowa businesses.
A new terminal at the Des Moines International Airport to accommodate passenger growth.
And a new online resource for entrepreneurs looking to start a small business.
These are a few of the things the Greater Des Moines Partnership will pursue in the coming year.
Iowa's largest economic and community development organization unveiled its 2019 priorities Thursday night at the group's annual dinner at Community Choice Credit Union Convention Center.
J.D. Vance, a New York Times best-selling author and venture capitalist, was the evening's keynote speaker. Vance is best known for his memoir, "Hillbilly Elegy," that recounts social issues that affected middle America during his upbringing in Ohio and Kentucky.
The Partnership's five priorities center on creating a technology-ready workforce, establishing Des Moines as an entrepreneurial center, and moving the needle on several region-defining projects.
The priorities for 2019 build on previous successes, Kathryn Kunert, vice president of economic connections and integration at MidAmerican Energy and the Partnership's new chairwoman, told the Des Moines Register.
"We had a theme last year that I absolutely love — 'maximizing momentum' — and I think that's what 2019 definitely represents," she said.
Here's a look at the Partnership's 2019 priorities.
Advancing adult's technology skills The Partnership wants to help central Iowa's working adults complete the post-secondary education they need to find jobs with local employers.
Its goal is to see 75 percent of working adults obtain degrees, certificates and other credentials by 2025. About 65.3 percent of central Iowa's workforce was there last year, according to the organization.
To fill that 10 percent gap, the Partnership will expand its Code DSM Academy, a 150-hour course that teaches students how to code.
It was developed with Des Moines Area Community College last year. Both organizations spent 2018 building the program's curriculum and recruiting students.
The first class begins Jan. 28. It's capped at 16 students, and there's currently a waiting list, said Courtney Shaw, vice president of communications for the Partnership.
The Partnership also plans to create a regional career expo for middle and high school students that focuses on jobs of the future.
Creating a railroad transfer station The Partnership is working with the city of Des Moines and the Des Moines Area Metropolitan Planning Organization to sign an operator and begin construction on a long-awaited $15.6 million railroad transfer station on the city's southeast side.
The transload facility — also called a railport — will serve as a transfer point where bulk materials are moved from semi-trailers to trains, which could reduce shipping costs for local companies.
Opening the facility could help Des Moines attract new logistics operations, said Jay Byers, CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership. It also will help existing businesses lower shipping costs by providing rail access, he said.
The Des Moines Area Metropolitan Planning Organization was recently awarded an $11.2 million U.S. Department of Transportation grant that will allow the project to break ground by the end of 2019. It's planned to be built across the street from the Richard A. Clark Municipal Services Center, located at 1551 E. Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway, along four rail lines that link Des Moines to destinations across the country.
Working toward an active river The Partnership will continue its long-term goal of turning 150 miles of waterways in central Iowa into a recreational amenity.
The centerpiece of the group's water trails plan is a series of whitewater features that would replace three low-head dams along the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, and draw kayakers, paddlers and even surfers. It also includes out-of-water activities like zip-lining and rock climbing along the riverfront.
The Partnership plans to spend 2019 creating a "water trails incubator" that will work toward bringing the project to fruition by targeting businesses that have a vested interest in creating a regional amenity to attract a younger and more talented workforce, Kunert said.
"We know the next generation wants this," she said.
One piece of that long-term plan, the Lauridsen Skatepark, is scheduled to open in 2019.
Advancing the new airport terminal The Partnership will work to gather business leaders' voices in the fight for funding a new terminal at the Des Moines International Airport.
Airport and Partnership officials have lobbied federal and state lawmakers for money to build a $500 million terminal. The Partnership believes that effort could be strengthened by having local business leaders join the chorus.
A record 2.77 million flyers passed through the airport in 2018. Airport officials say the terminal, which was built in 1948, will be above capacity once it reaches 3 million passengers a year.
"If you have good air service ... that determines whether or not people are feeling they can locate their business here or keep their business here because you have the availability of flights and convenience," said Dan Houston, president and CEO at Principal and the outgoing Partnership board chair.
"And we have that, but we need to build on it. Because, frankly, the status quo won't get it done."
Establishing a small-business hub The Partnership launched on its website Thursday a Small Business Resources Hub for entrepreneurs looking to relocate or expand in Des Moines.
The hub will have small business and startup resources in one place.
It's also launching a mentoring program to connect new entrepreneurs with experienced small business owners.

Conspiracy theories

Texto completo: Conspiracy theories have always been around, but lately, they've been getting more attention. As the prevalence of conspiracy thinking amongtheelectorate and even within the highest offices of government has become clear, conspiracism has inspired popular think-pieces and attracted scholars. Along the way, conspiracy theories have also inspired plenty of myths. Here are five.
Myth No. 1 Conspiracy theories are for the lunatic fringe.
Find any recent article from a mainstream news outlet on conspiracy theories, and there's a good chance it will feature tinfoil hats, lizard people or flat-Earthers: signals that we're in crazy territory. Witness the charming lizard-man animation that accompanies the Wired online guide to conspiracy theories; coverage of various celebrities claiming that the Earth is flat; or a Washington Post columnist writing: "Time to trade in those red #MAGA caps, Trumpkins. If you want your headgear to fit in with the latest White House fashions, invest in some tinfoil."
Presenting fringe theories as the essence of conspiracism gives the impression that conspiracy theorists are a handful of kooks who will believe even the most ludicrous ideas. But conspiracy thinking - the inclination to entertain conspiracy theories in general - is much more widespread than belief in any particular theory.
The conspiracies that elicit smirks aren't popular: In a 2013 poll, 4 percent of American voters said they agreed that lizard people control politics, and in a 2018 poll, 7 percent of U.S. adults said the Earth might not be round. For comparison, Bigfoot had around twice the fan base in several surveys.
Other theories, though, attract much larger followings. More than half of Americans said they believed at least one of the conspiracy theories they were asked about in surveys between 2006 and 2011, blaming the Iraq War on oil companies or the 9/11 attacks on U.S. government insiders, for example. A recent survey found the same proportion of conspiracy theorists among the British public. Even these figures are necessarily lowball estimates, since the surveys ask about only a handful of theories. It's safe to say that most of us are potential conspiracy theorists.
Myth No. 2 Conspiracy theories are more common than ever.
"Are we entering a golden age of the conspiracy theory?" asked a 2017 headline in the Guardian. "Conspiracy theories are more rampant than ever," asserted another in August 2018. The Internet - and social media in particular - is often blamed for fueling the fashion for conspiracism.
But there's no good evidence that conspiracy theories are more popular than they used to be. It's long been fashionable to claim that the current moment is the age of conspiracy theories: Thirty years ago, scholars asserted that previous generations "only dabbled in conspiracy like amateurs
" but that the conspiracy theorists of their own time had gone pro.
In the most thorough study to date, researchers combed through more than 100,000 letters to the editor published in the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune between 1890 and 2010. They found a stable background hum of conspiracy theorizing, not an ever-increasing cacophony.
This fits with the historical record: Conspiracy theories didn't suddenly flourish in the 21st century, or even the 20th. They've always been with us, and people have spread them through whatever technology was available. Ancient Athenians performed plays espousing plots about every aspect of their lives; 19th-century anti-vaccinationists printed posters. The Internet is a useful tool for indulging in conspiracy theories, but it doesn't seem to make people more inclined to go in for conspiracy theories in the first place.
Myth No. 3 Conspiracy theories are all in people's minds.
In 2018, the Independent ran the headline "Scientists discover the reason people believe in conspiracy theories." The answer, the article reported, is that it's all in people's heads. As research on the psychology of conspiracy theories has gained steam, explainers in the popular press usually frame the issue as a curious turn of the mind: "Why do seemingly sane people believe bizarre conspiracy theories?," or "Why we believe the unbelievable."
Psychological findings do help explain why people believe or dismiss conspiracy theories. But focusing exclusively on unconscious biases and cognitive mistakes overlooks the fact that there is often a kernel of believability at the heart of these theories. Governments and organizations do things in secret. Intelligence agencies plan assassinations and coups, spy on people, try to manipulate public opinion.
Even if you're pretty sure the government didn't develop HIV as a bioweapon to be deployed against unsuspecting citizens, for example, to suggest that government researchers might conduct secretive, unethical experiments involving the health and autonomy of marginalized people isn't crazy; it's history.
In a clever twist on the usual survey, psychologist Mike Wood once asked participants about typical unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, but also whether they believed claims involving government bribery, mind-control
experiments and efforts to influence the media (without mentioning that these conspiracies were historical fact). People who dismissed the conspiracy theories tended also to dismiss the real conspiracies.
Which is not to say that all conspiracy theories should be embraced, of course. But neither should conspiracy thinking be written off as a mere psychological flaw.
Myth No. 4 Conspiracy theories are an existential threat to society.
In the first few days of August 2018, mainstream news headlines described an emerging conspiracy theory as "bizarre," "dangerous," "terrifying
" and a "deranged conspiracy cult." The movement, one Post columnist wrote, "is scary because it's getting bigger, it's scary because we don't know how to stop it, and it's scary because the people behind it won't be stopped." Yikes.
The catastrophizing headlines were part of a broader tendency to paint conspiracism as a creeping contagion that "manages to insinuate itself in the most alert and intelligent minds," as historian Daniel Pipes charitably put it, or as "mumbo jumbo" that has already "conquered the world," as journalist Francis Wheen bluntly asserted.
Those articles last summer were about QAnon, a loose collection of cryptic nonsense that started online and manifested as a handful of people showing up at President Trump's rallies with homemade signs and shirts. Though the articles implied a substantial number of believers, none reported any data. Subsequent polling showed that many people - 4 in 10 - hadn't heard of QAnon or didn't know enough to have an opinion. Among those who knew about it, it was viewed overwhelmingly unfavorably (by both Democrats and Republicans). An analysis of the QAnon subreddit showed that a tiny but vocal contingent of boosters was making almost all the noise about it on the forum. Most people who engage with ideas like this just sit back and watch, probably treating the theories as a curiosity or entertainment.
Of course, ideas can have consequences. Timothy McVeigh
, the Oklahoma City bomber, saw himself as resisting a government conspiracy to grab the citizenry's guns; a man who believed in Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory about a D.C. pizzeria, fired a gun in the restaurant and terrorized its patrons, who included children. But these men are the exception, not the rule. Hyping up every conspiracy theory into an existential threat without any evidence is, ironically, the same habit of mind that produces conspiracy theories in the first place.
Myth No. 5 Facts don't change people's minds about conspiracy theories.
In a 2010 study, people first read misleading claims and were then given corrections to those claims. Reading the corrections appeared to be largely ineffective and actually increased mistaken beliefs among the people who had believed the incorrect claims most strongly to begin with.
This apparent "backfire effect" has taken on mythological status as an explanation for why it's hard - perhaps even counterproductive - to try changing people's opinions about conspiracy theories by hitting them with facts. A 2018 article in the Guardian asked, "Why are people today becoming so immune to facts?," citing the backfire effect. The RationalWiki page on the backfire effect goes so far as to say that it "makes most refutations useless." I perpetuated this myth myself in my 2015 book, "Suspicious Minds."
Recently, however, research has called the backfire effect into question. In 2017, researchers ran a series of studies in which more than 10,000 participants encountered 52 different claims and corrections. That work found no backfire effect, concluding that by and large, "citizens heed factual information" - even when it goes against what they are inclined to believe. Other studies likewise find that fact-checking and pointing out logical inconsistencies can reduce belief in conspiracy theories.
Correcting misconceptions won't persuade everyone to give up on every conspiracy theory, of course. But it appears to be no worse - and often better - than nothing.

Texto completo: If December is the month of self-indulgence, January is the month of self-reproach. Gym memberships and diet programs are part of the traditional response, but so, increasingly, is mindfulness. We are exhorted to improve our health and outlook by growing more intimate with the present.
While many Americans added mindfulness to their portfolios long ago, others are wary. What if it's boring? How can I tell if I'm doing it right? Will I lose my drive? Does this mean giving up potato chips? Still, beset by technological overload and runaway worries, almost everyone would like to feel more serene. For those who do not know where to begin, a few reading suggestions.
Though first published in 1990, Jon Kabat-Zinn's “Full Catastrophe Living — Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness" remains an indispensable overview. Kabat-Zinn began developing his program in mindfulness-based stress reduction in the late 1970s. Based at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, the Stress Reduction Clinic fleshed out the ideas found in “Full Catastrophe Living," and numerous subsequent books. “Full Catastrophe Living" lays out the scientific argument for mindfulness as a healing strategy. It is also designed to give readers access to the clinic's eight-week training program (simple yoga postures and meditation guides are included). Stories of patients who found relief have encouraged many readers to look further.
Kabat-Zinn might be thought of as our great adapter, a wholistic thinker who acknowledges his debt to Buddhism without getting lost in it. For readers intrigued by the religious roots of mindfulness, Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh has proven a congenial guide. (Also one of the most popular: He seems to have attached his name to even more books than Kabat-Zinn and in fact wrote the preface to the revised edition of “Full Catastrophe.") “ The Miracle of Mindfulness — An Introduction to the Practice of Meditation" is an excellent short primer with a sampling of meditation guides. (For a challenge befitting these polarized times, try the one called “compassion for the person you hate or despise the most.")
Goal-oriented readers might prefer cutting to the chase. Thich Nhat Hanh's “Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life" takes aim at what many consider Job One in January: weight loss. Co-authored with Lilian Cheung, a nutritionist and lecturer at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, “Savor" outlines how Buddhism's Four Noble Truths can be applied to over-eating. It offers guidance on understanding the roots of the problem; setting attainable goals; and staying on course. The bonus: Even if you stray, you might like yourself more than you did.
Those who wonder how much more might consult Dan Harris. An accomplished TV journalist, Harris grew up in the Boston area and rose to become co-anchor of “Nightline" at ABC News. His “10% Happier — How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-help that Actually Works: A True Story" is witty and informed. It's also the perfect guide for the hard-charging professional who scoffs (as Harris once did) at the very idea of meditation.
Harris began his unlikely journey after experiencing a panic attack on air. A chance assignment to ABC's religion beat helped shape his quest. Among others, Harris interviewed Eckhart Tolle, whose “A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose," became an Oprah's Book Club selection. He also got to know spiritual guru and self-help author Deepak Chopra. It was a while before Harris realized that the best parts of Tolle's thinking were repackaged Buddhism, but once he did, and after his resistance melted during a summer vacation, he finally gave meditation a try. Before long, he was sold.
Apart from telling his personal story, Harris trains a reporter's eye on the growing body of scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of mindfulness. Perhaps inevitably, corporate America has taken notice. General Mills, Ford, and Google are among the many companies that have offered mindfulness training to employees. David Gelles, a New York Times business writer, provides a helpful summary of the criticisms that have emerged in “Mindful Work: How Meditation is Changing Business from the Inside Out."
Himself an enthusiastic practitioner, Gelles nevertheless shines a thoughtful light on what he calls “McMindfulness" and the backlash against companies that appear to have found an ingenious way to improve productivity (and even, as Aetna has found, to lower health-care costs). Critics fear that mindfulness training only helps make stressed-out workers more compliant. Instead of, for instance, organizing to improve working conditions, they are primed to shoulder more. Yet as Harris notes, many adherents argue that mindfulness practices improve one's capacity to take effective action. Right or wrong, this notion is what might be identified, in meditation, as a thought. For the moment, let it go. Just breathe.

Texto completo: The "special relationship" was not supposed to look like this.
On both sides of the pond, governments are wracked by chaos and paralysis. In Washington, a bid by President Trump to get funding for a border wall has triggered the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history. In London, Prime Minister Theresa May clings to power, even after seeing her Brexit deal suffer a historic defeat in Parliament this week that would have felled earlier governments.
The sense of crisis mounts. Security officers patrolling American waters and safeguarding U.S. ports of entry are now working without paychecks (and are furious about it). In anticipation of a catastrophic "no-deal" Brexit in 10 weeks, May's government said it would mobilize army reservists to help deal with the untold headaches that crashing out of the European Union would bring.
The workings of democracy are under pressure. The speaker of the House sought to postpone Trump's annual State of the Union address; the president retaliated by scrapping her congressional trip to Afghanistan, where she and a bipartisan delegation were due to visit U.S. troops. Democrats and Republicans have dug in their heels as distrust between the parties deepens.
In Britain, all paths forward threaten further uncertainty and rancor. The imperative to abide by the narrow results of the 2016 Brexit referendum has pushed a slow-moving constitutional crisis into its third year and could still lead to the implosion of May's Conservative Party.
Majorities in both countries have clear feelings: Most Americans oppose the government shutdown; most Britons do not want to leave the European Union without a deal in place. But the hard-bitten nationalism of some voters has driven both countries to a cliff's edge. Trump's decision to pander to his hard-line base has led him to embrace political brinkmanship. Neither May nor her chief opponent, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, is calling for the option many think would make the most sense - a second referendum - out of fear of the furious reaction from Brexiteers.
"Rarely have British and American politics seemed quite so synchronized as they do in the chilly dawn of 2019, three years after the victories of Brexit and Donald J. Trump upended the two nations' political establishments," Ellen Barry and Mark Landler of the New York Times wrote last week. "The countries seem subject to a single ideological weather system - one that pits pro-globalization elites against a left-behind hinterland."
They pointed to the now-familiar story: The effects of the 2008 global financial crisis accentuated the divides between people in metropolitan centers and those in depressed postindustrial towns. Anger among the latter fueled Trump and Brexit.
"The people in those areas just said: 'O.K., we're not giving them any more time, the people in London and D.C., your time is up. We're not going to wait a few more years for a recovery,' " Michael Lind, the author of "Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States," told the Times. "They decided: 'There's a limited pie. This pie is not growing.' "
But it's become painfully clear that neither Brexit nor Trump will redress these economic anxieties. Trump's trade wars and tax cuts have, in many instances, hurt those whom he promised to lift. He instead wages a culture war, conjuring a crisis on the border that's largely unsupported by fact.
Brexit, too, was provoked by the illusory visions of politicians. The years since the referendum have proved that there can be no easy divorce with the European Union - and that life outside the continental bloc may be far more bleak and lonely than imagined.
At a town hall this week on the other side of the English Channel, French President Emmanuel Macron flatly declared that "the British people were sold a lie."
Others see an even darker plot: the shadow of the Kremlin. The paralysis in both countries "adds up to a strategic bonanza for Vladimir Putin and his vision of a revanchist Russia," wrote The Washington Post's James Hohmann in the Daily 202. "We don't know exactly how much Moscow spent supporting influence operations to impact the U.K. and U.S. elections in 2016, but it seems hard to overstate how good the Kremlin's return has been on what Western intelligence agencies believe was a relatively modest investment."
For Britain, there's a sense of historical comeuppance. The Brexiteers campaigned on the fumes of imperial delusion, promising a future in which Britain reclaimed its global preeminence once free of its ties to Brussels. Instead, that very colonial legacy now haunts its political present.
"Partition - the British Empire's ruinous exit strategy - has come home," Indian leftist writer Pankaj Mishra wrote in a New York Times op-ed. "In a grotesque irony, borders imposed in 1921 on Ireland, England's first colony, have proved to be the biggest stumbling block for the English Brexiteers chasing imperial virility. Moreover, Britain itself faces the prospect of partition if Brexit, a primarily English demand, is achieved and Scottish nationalists renew their call for independence."
In the United States, other chickens are coming home to roost. The American public largely faults Trump for the current crisis and sees through his efforts to blame Democrats. That's partially because previous shutdowns have also been a Republican legacy.
"The GOP's proclivity for using government shutdowns to force through its agenda is another example of its drunken frat-boy antics," wrote Post columnist Max Boot. "The three longest government shutdowns in U.S. history were all caused by Republican temper tantrums."
Gary Cohn, Trump's former top economic adviser, told the Boston Globe that the shutdown was "completely wrong," adding that he was "confused" about the White House strategy.
"I don't understand what the outcome is here," he said, "and I don't understand where we're going with it."
It's a feeling of uncertainty that stretches across the Atlantic.

Resumen: This editorial from April 10, 1968, ties “the bitterness” in American policies during the war in Vietnam to the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Those “twin trials,” the editorial board writes, should cause every American deep shame. Part of a 2019 archival project on Dr. King.

Texto completo: The United States is being called upon to learn a profound lesson, one which is necessary to its peace and progress, and, perhaps in the ultimate analysis, to its very survival as well. Yet the truth of this lesson has been available for many centuries, being set forth sharply and urgently in the book of Proverbs: “Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.” Seldom if ever in its history have an understanding and an acceptance of these words been more sorely needed in the United States than today.
Out of the twin trials of the war in Vietnam and of race relations, there have arisen widespread evidences of hate, of bitterness, of resort to violence, of intolerance. These in turn have spawned acts and attitudes of which no American should be other than deeply ashamed and which have so seriously tarnished America’s image abroad.
Stark and savage as it was, the murder of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was but the outward manifestation of the hatred felt in so many hearts. It was the sudden volcanic explosion of the uncontrolled and unsubdued forces which lie below the surface.
Similarly, the bitterness which has arisen over American policies in Southeast Asia have, in a sense, produced its victims. The decision of the President of the United States not to seek reelection is but one example of this. So, in part, are the bitterness being shown various presidential candidates, and the intolerance exhibited toward differing viewpoints. As Russell Baker wrote in the New York Times, “A good part of the population has been hooked on hate for a long time now. . . .”
Such bitterness and hatred is the most corrosive element which can enter national life. It makes it impossible for a man or a country to think correctly or constructively and leads him to take decisions and commit acts which he would not dream of in sober moments. Often it even blinds him from seeing what he is doing to himself and others.
It is to be hoped that the shock of Dr. King’s assassination and stunning surprise of President Johnson’s withdrawal will contribute to a national awakening, to a recognition of how deeply the American people had allowed themselves to become mired in animosities. But the only guarantee of such an awakening is through a recognition of what hatred is and what it seeks to do. The founder of this newspaper, Mary Baker Eddy, wrote, “Hatred inflames the brutal propensities.” But she also wrote, “Human hate has no legitimate mandate and no kingdom. Love is enthroned.” When men strive to prove these latter facts, the problems of race and the problems of war will be more quickly solved.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — An exhibition of photographs tracing John F. Kennedy’s private life and public trajectory opens at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum on Feb. 15. Some are iconic images of Camelot, while many have rarely been seen before.
"American Visionary: John F. Kennedy’s Life and Times" shows Kennedy as a joyful boy playing in the ocean and a troubled president working in the Oval Office, as a public figure adored by crowds and a father alone with his baby daughter. Jacqueline Kennedy is there, too — as a happy bride, an elegant first lady and a heartbroken widow.
The exhibition, one of the most exhaustively researched collections of Kennedy photos ever assembled, runs through May 19. It brings together images from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, Getty Images, private collections, and the Kennedy family archives.
Alan Lowe, executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, called the exhibit "a wonderful snapshot of JFK’s life."
"We are honored to bring ‘American Visionary’ to Springfield," Lowe said. "Not only are the photos wonderful, but they offer a chance to reflect on a man who, like Abraham Lincoln, served his nation in a time of great challenge and gave his life in that service."
There is no extra fee to see the exhibition. It will be included in regular ALPLM admission.
The exhibition is based on the book "JFK: A Vision for America" by Stephen Kennedy Smith and Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who contributes frequently to CNN and The New York Times. Brinkley will speak at the presidential library on April 12. The topic will be his latest book, "American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space Race."
"American Visionary" was organized and curated by Lawrence Schiller of Wiener Schiller. Schiller, a noted photographer, writer and director, will be taking part in a special preview Feb. 13. The free preview, which runs 6:30-8:30 p.m., is open to members of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation. To become a member, visit www.ALPLM.org.
Another special event takes place Feb. 19. In "Fact vs. Fiction: Lincoln and Kennedy," two historians will examine the supposedly "eerie" coincidences between the assassinated presidents and explain which ones have some significance, which are random chance and which have simply been made up.
Kennedy’s administration coincided with a golden age of photojournalism in America. Photographers such as Ed Clark, Lisl Steiner, Ralph Crane and Steve Schapiro captured the optimism and challenges of the early 1960s in some of the finest and most vivid images of the period.
"John F. Kennedy is still seen as a symbol around the world, representing and espousing the best and most universal elements of the American character," said Stephen Kennedy Smith, Kennedy’s nephew and co-editor of "JFK: A Vision for America." "It is our hope that the compelling images of President Kennedy’s life and work on view in this exhibition will remind visitors not only of the values that defined his presidency, but also will introduce him to new audiences and future leaders."

Kennedy’s administration coincided with a golden age of photojournalism in America. Photographers such as Ed Clark, Lisl Steiner, Ralph Crane and Steve Schapiro captured the optimism and challenges of the early 1960s in some of the finest and most vivid images of the period.
Highlights of "American Visionary" include: * A 1953 photo booth snapshot of the Kennedy newlyweds, possibly taken on their honeymoon * A candid 1958 photograph of Kennedy playing with his baby daughter, Caroline, in her bassinet * A 1960 photograph of people peering at Kennedy through the window as he prepares for a campaign speech * A 1961 photograph of the First Couple and others heading to Kennedy’s inauguration ceremony, with the White House blanketed in snow * A haunting photograph of the first lady departing the White House on the day of Kennedy’s state funeral in 1963.
"John F. Kennedy is still seen as a symbol around the world, representing and espousing the best and most universal elements of the American character," said Stephen Kennedy Smith, Kennedy’s nephew and co-editor of "JFK: A Vision for America." "It is our hope that the compelling images of President Kennedy’s life and work on view in this exhibition will remind visitors not only of the values that defined his presidency, but also will introduce him to new audiences and future leaders."
The presidential library and museum uses a combination of rigorous scholarship and high-tech showmanship to immerse visitors in the life and times of Abraham Lincoln. Visitors can see ghosts come to life on stage, watch TV coverage of the 1860 presidential election, roam through the Lincoln White House, experience booming cannons in a Civil War battle and come face to face with priceless original Lincoln artifacts.
The library holds an unparalleled collection of Lincoln books, documents, photographs, artifacts and art, as well as some 12 million items pertaining to all aspects of Illinois history.

Texto completo: WESTBROOK -- A world- famous ice disk is spinning again, thanks to a Freeport photographer who used a paddleboard, an ice pick and an adventurous spirit Thursday afternoon to free the giant chunk of ice that had become frozen to the bank of the Presumpscot River.
Andrew Sims said he felt compelled to free the disk after it became stuck Wednesday and disappointed dozens of onlookers who had come to the city's River Walk to see it. He also saw an opportunity to do some time-lapse photography.
Westbrook's ice disk has drawn international media attention while fueling jokes about a supernatural omen or alien invasion.
The disk has been covered by the BBC, ABC's "Good Morning America" and The New York Times, among other news outlets. It also has been a boon to businesses in the area - one bar was serving a cocktail it called the "Ice Disk Cosmo" - catering to the people who have come from far and wide to witness an unusual natural phenomenon.
Adding to the sensation, two more ice disks were reported in Maine on Thursday. One was in Baxter State Park on the Nesowadnehunk Stream and the other was nearby on the West Branch of the Penobscot River near the Abol Bridge.
But the ice disk in Westbrook is much larger. Seen from above, it is an almost perfectly symmetrical circle of ice about 300 feet across that vaguely resembles a moon.
The disk had been surrounded by open water since at least Monday and was slowly spinning counterclockwise until Wednesday, when it lodged against stationary ice near the riverbank.
Sims had visited Westbrook on Wednesday and was disappointed the disk had stopped turning. An experienced paddleboarder, he returned Thursday determined to see if he could get it spinning again. Launching his paddleboard into the river at around 2:30 p.m., he kneeled on it while he began cutting around the edge using an ice pick and his own weight to break the ice where it was attached to the bank.
By 4:30 p.m., the disk was floating free and again slowly spinning counterclockwise. Based on his time-lapse photos, Sims estimates it was taking about three minutes for the disk to complete one revolution.
Sims, interviewed Thursday night while standing on the top level of a parking garage overlooking the Presumpscot, said a crowd of onlookers started applauding when they realized he had freed the disk.
"It's awesome," Sims said. "I was pretty excited."
Watching the mission unfold was Doug Bertlesman, who had a view from his riverfront office at Ethos Marketing. Coworkers crowded around the window to watch. Some thought it was a fool's errand.
"We were like, 'This is insane. There was no way he's going to be able to do this.' He came at it from two sides and cut it loose. And then he pushed it, he pushed it across the river back to where it was. We're just laughing. There is no way. What an idiot. And sure enough."
With temperatures expected to remain well below freezing, Bertlesman suggested the city hire someone to "keep things moving."
"You can imagine the posting," Bertlesman said. "Must be good in a kayak and be able to withstand cold temperatures."
A day earlier, Westbrook police dissuaded a man from attempting to climb onto the famous slab of frozen river water. Officers responded to the end of Ash Street for a report that a man had tethered himself to a tree with a rope and ventured onto the river ice in an apparent attempt to reach the disk.
The attempt was partially captured on video from a nearby office building. The video shows five people standing on the shore as a sixth, trailing a rope, walks toward the edge of the ice disk and pokes at the sheet of ice below him with a stick or cane.
The video ends before the man reaches the disk, and before police arrived to end the expedition.
"This is something that happens," police Captain Steven Goldberg said. "We don't always have an ice disk on the river, but we always get ice and people try to get out onto the ice, and it's never safe. The ice on the Presumpscot River in Westbrook is never thick enough to go on."
Police did not have any reason to compel the man to tell them who he was, and he did not volunteer his identity.
"People are strange sometimes with their motivation," Goldberg said. "He left the scene, he was safe. It could have been a lot worse, and luckily it wasn't."
Dozens of people lined the riverbank late Thursday afternoon. Most were content to take photographs of the disk with their cellphones or to stand back and admire Mother Nature's work. Nearby restaurants and bars were packed with customers.
"It looks like the moon," said Hunter McGuire, who drove with her mother, Heather McGuire, and their dog Jade - a black poodle - more than an hour from their home in Readfield just to see the disk. The McGuires, who recently moved to Maine from Florida, had never visited Westbrook before.
"We had to see this phenomenon because we'll never see anything like it again," Heather McGuire said.
Betty and Terry Phillips live in Bridgton. They had an appointment Thursday morning in Augusta and then decided to drive to Westbrook to see the ice disk they had heard about on television. The couple said the long drive was worth the trip.
"I am so pleased," Betty Phillips said. "It's fascinating and it is awesome."
Legends Restaurant and Taproom, located a few feet from the river path, was doing a booming business Thursday evening.
Bartender Chyle Cameron said the establishment saw an opportunity to capitalize on the ice disk craze and earlier this week it started serving up Ice Disk Cosmo, a mix of raspberry vodka, Chamboard, a raspberry liqueur, and lime.
"It has been flying today," Cameron said of the cocktail.
Ice disks are natural phenomenon that form in rivers and streams, and range greatly in size. They are believed to be almost perfectly round because the shoreline or other ice formations grind down the edges after it begins to rotate in an eddy current.
One study that explored why the disks spin theorized that a vortex of cooling water under the ice helps propel the motion, but that experiment used tiny, 4-inch disks in artificially heated water baths as hot as 140 degrees.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The New York Times is full of dream jobs: Pete Wells gets paid to eat at restaurants; Sebastian Modak is about to travel around the world; Will Shortz is living his eighth-grade dream of making a career out of puzzles. But my job is the most fun of all.
I am The Times's go-to cleaning contributor. (Yes, one exists!) Most people, when they hear the word "cleaning," do not immediately think of fun, but, truly, those people are missing out. I do all manner of work related to cleaning: big, broad-scope guides on how to clean your entire home; narrow, niche articles about things like caring for Halloween costumes (you'll want to get another use out of that Sexy Gritty ensemble, naturally); and reported features in which I get to the bottom of why all vintage clothing stores smell like, well, vintage clothing stores.
You will, of course, want to know how I got this way and what, exactly, qualifies me to do this work. Well, I know an awful lot about cleaning, and I've been writing about it for almost eight years for publications including Esquire and Jezebel. I've been working with The Times since 2017. But more important, there's a combination of empathy, humor and a desire to solve problems that makes me especially suited for this job. I'm a fixer. A family member once said, awed after I'd intervened in a Thanksgiving cooking disaster in the making, "Jolie, you're like the Wolf from 'Pulp Fiction."' It's the greatest compliment I've ever received.
You might be surprised to learn that, like "Pulp Fiction," being a cleaning expert is hilariously profane. (Here comes the part where you begin to understand, or understand not at all, based on how much you enjoy a dirty joke, why I'm so certain I have the most fun job at The New York Times.) Your lives are quite often booze- and sex-soaked; even more often, because of toddlers and college students and pets, they are pee-soaked. And you write to me about these problems! I find it endlessly fascinating and amusing and also quite touching to be trusted with your messy lives.
In your hands, even the most mundane of household furniture, the humble couch, can be fodder for hilarity, as one reader recently demonstrated. His email opened chirpily enough, "Hi Jolie!" Then, a turn toward the dark: "I'm currently stuck to my couch, so I figure it's time to solve this mess."
As it turns out, the joy in reading about cleaning isn't really in the solutions themselves, though they can be funny. (Using a paste made of meat tenderizer -- the unseasoned stuff, please! -- for removing set-in blood stains from mattresses? True story!) Rather, it's in marveling at the marvelous messes people have made for and of themselves. And so, you read. (Or listen, if you're a podcast enthusiast. I have one of those! It's called "Ask a Clean Person.")
Here's the downside to my job: I cannot be all things to all people. This hurts me in the tenderest part of my tender heart, because, truly, the joy of the job -- other than the joy that comes along with the voyeurism of learning how, exactly, you fused your rear end to the sofa -- is helping people. But I can know only as much as you tell me; absent the richness of a full life's context, my advice will always be imperfect. I do, however, endeavor to provide solutions and options that fit three sometimes opposing criteria: the best solution to a problem; a budget-friendly approach to cleaning and caring for your belongings; and an eco-friendly and/or nontoxic option, because that matters to a great many people.
But those burdens are mine, and mine alone, and as we've established, your burdens are much more interesting. So let's return to the matter of the viscous couch. The problem, you see, was that its owner, in a misguided attempt to restore its good looks, had doused the cushions in leather conditioner, and then placed them on his roof to bake in the sun. He essentially seasoned it like a cast iron skillet! The solution, then, was to head to the kitchen for a Dobie Pad with which to scour the stickiness away -- a trick I learned about from spending, oh, a few thousand hours watching car detailing videos on YouTube and can now pass onto you. But should you find yourself stumped in the face of a cleaning conundrum, don't fret! Just write to me.

With Little Left to Cut Back On, Federal Workers File for Unemployment

Texto completo: On the second day of the year, Danielle Miller gave up on the federal government.
Furloughed from her Internal Revenue Service job near Cincinnati and fearful of running out of money during the partial government shutdown, she filed for unemployment benefits: $414 a week, about $200 less than usual.
"Once Christmas came and went, after New Year's, I was like, I can't go on," said Ms. Miller, a single mother who has worked for the I.R.S. for almost 14 years. She spent part of this week calculating when her first unemployment check would arrive. "It's disappointing, and it's frustrating," she said. "I have a job."
The shutdown, the longest on record, is prompting tens of thousands of federal employees to seek jobless benefits. As the impasse meanders through its fourth week and more bills come due, their numbers have been growing.
On Thursday, two days after the White House doubled its projections and warned that the shutdown was reducing quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points per week, the Labor Department reported 10,454 initial claims by federal workers for the week that ended Jan. 5, doubling the previous week's figure. Thousands more have applied since, state officials said.
"We're certainly prepared for an influx of claims," said William Walton, the director of unemployment insurance services at the Virginia Employment Commission. "The logical conclusion is that the longer the partial federal shutdown continues, the more claims we're going to see."
The trend is especially acute in the District of Columbia and neighboring Maryland and Virginia, which have many federal offices and installations. But a survey of state labor agencies by The New York Times shows that the shutdown is driving a mounting wave of unemployment filings across the country.
Texas has received more than 2,900 claims from federal workers since the shutdown began on Dec. 22, while Ohio is approaching 700. Kansas reported 445 filings, and Alabama was closing in on 500. Montana said it had logged almost 1,500.
But those may only be the beginning. About 380,000 furloughed federal workers are eligible for benefits, and if the White House and Congress remain at odds over President Trump's demand for a wall along the southwestern border, state officials expect many thousands more applications.
"We need to be cognizant and responsive to our customers' needs," said Jeff Fitzgerald, who oversees the unemployment insurance program in Colorado, which has so far received about 2,200 federal claims. "At present, there is no foreseeable end to the customers' needs, so, yeah, we're bracing for that."
Federal workers and the leaders of their unions said this week that people had begun to shift their thinking about how to get through the shutdown, which has not had a swift resolution. They said they were increasingly giving up on the idea that short-term stopgaps like borrowing from family and friends or postponing purchases would be enough.
"This week they're projecting, 'What do I need to do this week to pay February's mortgage and February's utilities?"' said Steve Reaves, a Federal Emergency Management Agency employee who leads the union for FEMA workers.
Mr. Reaves, who lives in Texas, prepared his own unemployment claim over the weekend.
"We need help on groceries, we need help on utility bills," said Mr. Reaves, who said he did not apply for unemployment during the 16-day shutdown in 2013. "We're cutting back on everything," he said.
Federal employees are covered by a separate unemployment insurance system parallel to that for other workers. But the two systems are nearly identical, and are administered similarly by the states. A significant difference is that federal agencies, rather than private employers, bear the costs of the federal system.
The Labor Department and many employment lawyers say that filing a claim now is not an option for all of the roughly 420,000 federal employees who are "essential" and are working without pay during the partial shutdown. According to the department, workers in those circumstances are "generally not eligible" to receive benefits.
There were not yet signs that many federal workers were rushing to drain retirement accounts.
The Thrift Savings Plan, a government retirement program with about 5.5 million participants, has received more than 5,500 requests for hardship withdrawals since Dec. 26, but Kim Weaver, a spokeswoman for the plan, said that was only a slight increase over the same period a year ago, and could not yet be directly tied to the shutdown. Ms. Weaver noted that the plan's enrollment had grown since last year, and that in response to recent natural disasters, the I.R.S. had made hardship withdrawals easier to obtain.
In state unemployment offices, administrators said they expected the cost of the shutdown to mount every day. They said that earlier shutdowns like the one in 2013 and the plentiful near-misses over the years had taught them how to prepare for this one.
"What we have, unfortunately, working for us is experience," said Cher Roybal Haavind, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, which set up a nine-person team in Denver to answer inquiries from federal workers.
Some state officials said they had asked utilities and other companies to extend mercy to federal employees, and the federal Office of Personnel Management -- essentially the government's human resources department -- published sample letters that furloughed employees could send to creditors to ask for patience.
Still, officials said unemployment insurance usually offers the surest way to assist furloughed workers, even though they can be reluctant to apply. It can take weeks for benefits to start flowing, and then, when the shutdown ends and retroactive pay is granted, workers will generally have to reimburse the state for their unemployment benefits.
"They're appreciative of our support and our service, but they're very frustrated they even have to do it," said Suzan G. LeVine, the employment security commissioner in Washington State, where about 2,200 federal workers have applied for benefits. "They have a job -- why should they have to get unemployment insurance?"
Ms. LeVine said that in her state it typically takes two to three weeks for a claim to be processed. Although she and officials from other states said they were trying to expedite the work, the shutdown came at a busy time for them, when they were already coping with high seasonal volumes of claims from agriculture and construction workers.
Governors, including Gavin Newsom of California, where there are about 245,000 federal employees, have been urging workers to file claims; so have union leaders like Mr. Reaves, who worry about backlogs and waiting periods.
"What I've been preaching to them is to get it, because it will make ends meet until the furlough is over," Mr. Reaves said of his members. He said he knew of a handful of FEMA employees, though, who decided not to wait out the shutdown and found other jobs.
Ms. Miller, the furloughed I.R.S. worker, said she hoped that unemployment benefits would help her avoid a similar reckoning. Two of her three children live with her in Covington, Ky., just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, and she said she had already borrowed money from her parents to pay for groceries while waiting for her benefit checks to start.
"I would like to think it would not go on for weeks or months, but at this point, I have no idea," she said of the shutdown. "I'm playing it day by day. I don't want to have to find another job. I've put in 14 years at this place."
When she went to apply for unemployment online, she said, the state website asked why she needed help.
"There was no option for shutdown," she said. "It's frustrating because it's not that I don't want to work, and it's not that I can't work. It's that I'm not allowed to work."

Texto completo: When Julie Conley was furloughed from her job at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in late December as part of the partial federal government shutdown, it felt kind of like a vacation - albeit an unexpected one.
Her oldest daughter was home from college and her younger daughter, a senior at Davis High School, was on winter break. Other friends and family members were taking time off for the holidays.
"I got lots of time with family over the holidays," said Conley, 50, who monitors and conducts rangeland restoration activities for the agency. "I had more time to do things for them."
Reality hit earlier this month when friends and family returned to work or school and she stayed home.
Conley is grateful that she and her husband are not living paycheck to paycheck. But even so, she feels betrayed.
"It makes you feel like a pawn," she said. "That's what's frustrating about it. I'm sort of this negotiation piece."
With the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history entering its 27th day, she isn't alone.
About 1,200 people work in federal government jobs in Yakima County as of 2017, according to Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages figures provided by the state Employment Security Department.
Pinching pennies
There have been moments of relief when government officials have managed to find workarounds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, for example, announced an arrangement that would extend food stamp recipients' benefits into February.
Rita Buckles also is breathing a sigh of relief. Buckles, 68, received her late husband's monthly pension check from the U.S. Coast Guard as scheduled earlier this month. The check goes toward the mortgage on her Yakima home, where she, her daughter and her four grandchildren live.
Because of the shutdown, she's been trying to economize. One example: She's no longer drives to the landfill. While that's a savings of only a few dollars per trip, it's still money she wants to have if the pension checks temporarily stop coming.
She's also trying to pay a little extra on her mortgage, so she can own the title to her home earlier.
"I'm going to pinch every penny," she said.
Buckles may have the right idea - U.S. Coast Guard officials recently said new legislation is needed to fund checks for active and retired members. The Coast Guard, unlike other segments of the military, is under the Department of Homeland Security.
Active Coast Guard members have already missed their first paycheck and the prospect of funding coming before Feb. 1, when retirees are scheduled to receive checks, is uncertain.
Stepping in to help
Some relief may be coming: The United Services Automobile Association, a Texas-based insurance company, recently donated $15 million to a charitable organization to provide interest-free loans to Coast Guard workers.
Locally and nationwide, banks and credit unions are also offering no- or low-interest paycheck advances or loans to help workers affected by the shutdown.
Cashmere Valley Bank, which has branches in the Yakima area, is offering a no-fee, interest-free payroll advance for federal workers who have their paychecks directly deposited. Customers need to go to a local branch and sign a single-page form, said Taylor Stormo, Yakima market manager.
"We'll advance their paycheck and we'll get repaid when the government reopens and they get their back pay," he said.
Walla Walla-based Baker Boyer Bank is offering low-interest, no-fee loans of up to $10,000 for any federal worker who lives within their coverage area, which includes the Yakima Valley.
Washington Federal, which has a branch in Yakima, is also offering 90-day interest-free loans to any federal worker in any of the eight states where the bank operates.
Richland-based Gesa Credit Union, which has two branches in the Yakima area, also encourages customers to contact its customer service line to discuss possible options.
Trying to cope
Money aside, Conley, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife worker, simply wants to return to her job and tend to the work piling up.
"This is the time where I synthesize information I collected over the last field season and advise my clients on resource management," she said. "And none of that is happening."
But until she can return to work, Conley has tried to do different things to cope.
"I've tried to quit checking The New York Times every four hours," she said. "For my own my mental health, I had to quit doing that."
She's also started going to the gym during the day, when she would usually be working. She received a free monthlong membership to Functional Fitness, the gym affiliated with Pro-Motion Physical Therapy.
"What better thing to do than to use an unlimited first free month at a gym and focus on my health?" she said.

No, the government shutdown isn’t a ‘crisis’

Texto completo: This government shutdown is now longer than any in history. The media keep using the word “crisis.”
“Shutdown sows chaos, confusion and anxiety!” says The Washington Post. “Pain spreads widely.”
The New York Times headlined, it’s all “just too much!”
But wait. Looking around America, I see people going about their business — families eating in restaurants, employees going to work, children playing in playgrounds, etc. I have to ask: Where’s the crisis?
Pundits talk as if government is the most important part of America, but it isn’t.
We need some government, limited government. But most of life, the best of life, goes on without government, many of the best parts in spite of government.
Of course, the shutdown is a big deal to the 800,000 people who aren’t being paid. But they will get paid. Government workers always do — after shutdowns.
Columnist Paul Krugman calls this shutdown, “Trump’s big libertarian experiment.” But it’s not libertarian. Government’s excessive rules are still in effect, and eventually government workers will be paid for not working. That makes this a most un-libertarian experiment.
But there are lessons to be learned.
During a shutdown when Barack Obama was president, government officials were so eager to make a point by inconveniencing people that they even stopped visitors from entering public parks.
Trump’s administration isn’t doing that, so PBS found a new crisis: “Trash cans spilling… (P)ark services can’t clean up the mess until Congress and the president reach a spending deal,” reported “NewsHour.”
But volunteers appeared to pick up some of the trash.
Given a chance, private citizens often step in to do things government says only government can do.
The Washington Post ran a front-page headline about farmers “reeling… because they aren’t receiving government support checks.”
But why do farmers even get “support checks”?
One justification is “saving family farms.” But the money goes to big farms.
Government doesn’t need to “guarantee the food supply,” another justification for subsidies. Most fruit and vegetable farmers get no subsidies, yet there are no shortages of peaches, plums, green beans, etc.
Subsidies are a scam created by politicians who get money from wheat, cotton, corn and soybean agribusinesses. Those farmers should suck it up and live without subsidies, too.
During shutdowns, government tells “nonessential workers” not to come to work. But if they’re nonessential, then why do we pay 400,000 of them?
Why do we still pay 100,000 American soldiers in Germany, Japan, Italy and England? Didn’t we win those wars?
We could take a chainsaw to so much of government.
The New York Times shrieks, “Shutdown Curtails FDA Food Inspections!”
Only if you read on do you learn that meat and poultry inspection is done by the Department of Agriculture. They’re still working. And the FDA is restarting some inspections as well.
More important, meat is usually safe not because of government — but because of competition.
Food sellers worry about their reputations. They know they’ll get bad publicity if they poison people (think Chipotle), so they take many more safety measures than government requires.
One meat producer told me that they employ 2,000 more safety inspectors than the law demands.
Lazy reporters cover politicians. Interviewees are usually in one place — often Washington, D.C. Interviewing politicians is easier than covering people pursuing their own interests all over America. But those are the people who make America work.
While pundits and politicians act as if everything needs government intervention, the opposite is true.
Even security work is done better by the private sector. At San Francisco’s airport, security lines move faster. Passengers told me, “The screeners are nicer!” The TSA even acknowledged that those screeners are better at finding contraband. That’s because San Francisco (Kansas City, Seattle and a dozen smaller airports) privatized the screening process. Private companies are responsible for security.
Private contractors are better because they must compete. Perform badly, and they get fired.
But government never fires itself.
Government workers shout, “We are essential!” But I say: “Give me a break. Most of you are not.”

Hampshire's brightest lights

Texto completo: When one hears the word “Amherst," the image of the University of Massachusetts' looming library or the clock tower of elite Amherst College might come to mind. But another small, liberal arts college also calls the town home: Hampshire College, another elite school known for its nontraditional curriculum and gradeless courses. (On Tuesday, the college announced its desire for a merger, citing financial strain).
While the school's unconventional approach might strike some as a bit new-agey, Hampshire College is known for churning out high-performing alumni. Here are some of them.

Ken Burns — The Emmy-winning documentarian known for films like “Brooklyn Bridge," “The Central Park Five," “The Civil War," and “Baseball" started at Hampshire College in 1971.
In a promotional video for the college posted to YouTube in 2015, Burns said that applying to Hampshire was a “risk."
“I was supposed to go the University of Michigan for free. Instead I went back East to a college that had just been started, that had no history whatsoever, and it changed my life."
He also said that Hampshire inspired him to take risks, go against the grain, and have the courage to challenge himself.
“Choosing that path, the Hampshire path, has made all the difference in my life," he said.
David Shulkin — Shulkin earned his bachelor's degree in science in 1982. He has served as the president and CEO of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and at several other hospitals and medical centers.
Shulkin was appointed in 2015 as the undersecretary of health for the US Department of Veteran Affairs by former president Barack Obama before becoming the secretary of Veterans Affairs under President Trump. He made headlines in March 2018 after Trump fired Shulkin and nominated White House physician Ronny Jackson. Shulkin in March wrote a New York Times op-ed slamming D.C. culture and suggesting his ouster was the result of political forces.
One Hampshire professor, Nancy Lowry, described him as “a student with a sense of direction, moral purpose, and a sense of humor, a really nice young man," according to the school's website.
Liev Schreiber — Admittedly, we have a bit of a soft spot for Schreiber: He played former Boston Globe editor Marty Baron in the Oscar-winning movie “Spotlight," which portrayed the Globe's investigation into the clergy abuse scandal.
He started at Hampshire in 1985. After graduating, he went on to study at the Yale School of Drama, and has a resume chock full of roles in impressive films and shows, including “The Butler," “X-Men Origins: Wolverine," “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," “The Manchurian Candidate," and “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."
The actor now plays the titular character on Showtime series “Ray Donovan."
John Krakauer— The noted nonfiction writer and Brookline native graduated from Hampshire in 1976 with a degree in environmental studies. He served as editor of the college's newspaper.
His best-seller “Into Thin Air" recounts a fateful 1996 episode — when Krakauer was on assignment for Outside magazine — in which several climbers died on their descent from Mount Everest during a storm.
His other books include “Into the Wild," “Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman"; and Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town."
Lupita Nyong'o — The actress burst into the national spotlight for her role in “12 Years a Slave," for which she won an Oscar for her portrayal of Patsey. She has since starred in blockbuster films like “Black Panther," “The Jungle Book," and several “Star Wars" movies.
Nyong'o graduated from Hampshire in 2007 and went on to study at the Yale School of Drama. While at Hampshire, she made “In My Genes," a documentary that follows people with albinism who suffer discrimination in Kenya.
A Hampshire film professor, Baba Hillman, told Mass Live in 2013 that Nyong'o “always stood out from the beginning as a brilliant, gifted actor and exceptional filmmaker."

Bernie Sanders and Former Staffers Meet After Harassment Allegations; Senator has offered two public apologies on behalf of campaign, as he weighs a potential 2020 bid

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday heard directly from a group of former campaign staffers who said they faced sexual harassment and discrimination from colleagues during his 2016 presidential campaign.
As he weighs a potential 2020 bid, Mr. Sanders has offered two public apologies, and he and top aides have pledged to address the allegations that some women faced harassment or were mistreated while working on his 2016 campaign.
Mr. Sanders didn't immediately comment on the private meeting with about 30 former staff members at a Washington hotel. Arianna Jones, a Sanders campaign spokeswoman, declined to comment.
Pamela Coukos, one of the meeting's facilitators, said Wednesday it was the "first step in a process" that would seek to make recommendations on how to develop improved workplace policies.
"Campaign culture needs to be changed, and people who work on campaigns are important and should get the kinds of practices and procedures that make it a good workplace," said Ms. Coukos, founder of Working IDEAL, a workplace advisory firm. "I think everybody is committed to continuing this conversation and trying to use it to develop some good recommendations."

If the senator launches a second campaign for the Democratic nomination, he will be competing in a #MeToo era landscape against a large field of Democrats that could feature multiple women, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California.
Much of the party's success during the 2018 midterm elections was driven by a record number of female candidates for Congress and an outpouring of female voters energized by opposing President Trump. Such dynamics could hurt Mr. Sanders if his campaign were perceived as being hostile toward female staffers.
"Every candidate running for the Democratic nomination will need to take seriously the experiences and concerns of women, who are the backbone of the Democratic Party and the majority of general election voters," said Denise Feriozzi, a Democratic strategist.
The exchange Wednesday came in response to a letter, first reported by Politico, from a group of former Sanders workers, both men and women. They asked to "discuss the issue of sexual violence and harassment on the 2016 campaign, for the purpose of planning to mitigate the issue in the coming presidential cycle," according to the letter.
Mr. Sanders attended the meeting for an hour. Jane Sanders, the senator's spouse and adviser, also attended. The gathering was facilitated by a Washington-based consulting firm that provides expertise on workplace discrimination, diversity and pay equity issues.
Politico reported last week that Robert Becker, who led Mr. Sanders's Iowa campaign, forcibly kissed a woman who worked for the campaign during the Democratic convention in Philadelphia.
In a statement to the news outlet, Mr. Becker "categorically" denied any allegations of "improper and unprofessional conduct."
Advisers to Mr. Sanders have said that Mr. Becker won't play a role in any future campaign.
Mr. Sanders apologized last week to the women who had come forward with the allegations--his second apology of the month--telling Capitol Hill reporters: "What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable, and certainly not what a progressive campaign or any campaign should be about."
The senator initially apologized during a CNN interview on Jan. 2 after the New York Times reported allegations of sexual harassment by a number of women who worked on the campaign along with pay disparities between male and female staffers.
When asked in the interview if he had been aware of the allegations at the time, Mr. Sanders said he had been "a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case."

Texto completo: I am a 78-year old healthy woman facing a fourth surgery on my leg and am a bit depressed. Fortunately, I’ve recovered well from the previous three. Up until now I have been very active, hiking, traveling, dancing and continuing to work in my career. Several friends who have had recent surgeries tell me I need to get used to doing less and that’s just what I should expect given my age. Their negative outlook is distressing to me. Can you offer a little hope? T.S.
Dear T.S.
Yes, hope is on its way. Let’s look at the reality. We know with age we will experience changes at some point in time. Some might be disease related, others more mechanical such as a joint replacement. We may need more sleep and slow down a bit. Our immune system may not be as efficient. And then there are changes in our vision and hearing. Add to that the loss of muscle mass and flexibility. Many of these normal changes can be postponed with healthy lifestyles.
And part of that healthy lifestyle is our attitude. Here is what we know:
Becca Levy and colleagues from Yale found that those who are optimistic about their age and reject aging stereotypes can extend their life by 7.5 years. This powerful finding takes into account age, gender, wealth and self-reported health and loneliness. This research is based on a study of 660 men and women in Ohio who were followed for over 20 years. Levy found the years they gained from having a positive attitude was more than the years gained from low blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking and regular exercise.
In today’s world, it can be difficult to maintain a positive view of aging as we live in a youth-centric society, particularly in Southern California. On our sunny days we are surrounded by sleek bodies in their beach, running and biking attire. In addition to our culture, preferences for youth over older age are evident in employment, movies, the advertising industry, marketing and more. But the times are slowly changing.
A recent New York Times story (January 9, 2019) headlined “Older and in Power, Unwilling to Remain Unseen” referred to four older women in positions of power: Susan Zirinksy at 66 will take over CBS News in March and is the first woman to do so. Then there is Nancy Pelosi who at 78 was re-elected to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. Representative Maxine Waters at 79 will lead the Financial Services Committee. And Glenn Close at 71 beat out four younger women to win the Golden Globe award for best actress.
Yes, these all are women, which makes their position noteworthy because in general age works against women a little bit more than it does for men. You’ve heard the expression – gray hair on a man is distinguished; on a woman it’s old age. Additionally, women confront two biases: age and gender.
Let’s continue to look at reality. Those who have an illness, particularly chronic ones, may have a hard time being optimistic. Illness is scary, forcing people to deal with uncertainty, lack of control and turning themselves over to doctors. For many there is a realization their life is finite. Being positive all of the time may be unrealistic.
Older adults are resilient. They have lived through wars, divorces, losing a job, relocating, financial concerns, illness and then spring back. Jonathan Rauch, author of “The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50” writes that older people feel less stress and regret; they dwell less on negative information and are better able to regulate their emotions. As a result, older adults are reported to be happier in their later years. Clearly difficult events continue to occur; it’s their response to the events that changes over time.
Although I am in no position to judge your current situation, it sounds as though your problem is likely fixable, given you have recovered well from your previous leg surgeries. Yet there is always uncertainty.
There is hope. Your ongoing positive outlook and resilience should serve you well. As to your friends, you might mention that everyone is a case of one – and in your case you are planning for a full recovery and resuming your active life. I feel confident that you will do everything possible to make that happen.

E.J. Dionne Jr. : The media's bias should be toward democracy

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The belief that constitutional democracy is superior to other forms of government rests in part on its capacity to encourage open debate and thus social learning.

Social learning is underrated. Citizens can and do learn together and from each other. They pick up tidbits and cues from the public debate and then argue over back fences or kitchen tables, in their houses of worship or at their favorite bars and restaurants.

True, this is an idealized view. In the Trump era, many people avoid political talk with neighbors or family members they disagree with for fear of igniting bitter shouting matches.

And social learning is problematic when we only hang around with people who reinforce our own views and prejudices, as Bill Bishop suggested in his revelatory book, "The Big Sort." Social media pushes us further into ideological silos, something Russian hackers understood in 2016.

It ought to be the job of traditional media to help break this cycle. As Matthew Pressman shows in his recent history of journalism, "On Press," there was a purpose behind the old ideas of "objectivity" and "fairness." At their best, journalists examine questions of genuine importance and offer citizens a chance to hear competing arguments on various sides of the issues at stake. This task includes pointing out when claims are at odds with the facts.

Now only a naive rationalist would claim that politics is purely cerebral. It's also about passion, self-interest and the foibles of would-be political leaders. But for democracy to work well, we need a balance among reason, emotion and interest. When reason is in retreat and when candidates are given strong incentives to stir up ugly passions, we have a problem.

This is where we are now, and President Trump is both the product of this crisis and its apotheosis. He brought home just how nonsensical and dishonest our politics have become with his assertion last Thursday about Mexico paying for his border wall: "Obviously, I never said this, and I never meant they're going to write out a check."

This was shocking, even from an unrepentant liar. Trump denied ever saying something that, as David Nakamura reported in The Washington Post, he did say "at least 212 times during his campaign and dozens more since he took office."

This points to the media's major shortcoming in 2016: its continuing commitment to "both sides are equally flawed" journalism, which led to its failure to portray Trump as the moral aberration he is. As Frank Bruni recently noted in The New York Times (citing the research of Harvard professor Thomas Patterson), treating Trump and Hillary Clinton "identically" in terms of their "fitness for office" was "madness."

And as the Post's media critic Margaret Sullivan noted, journalism needs to pull back from a "focus on personalities and electability" and on blowing gaffes "way out of proportion." She endorsed New York University professor Jay Rosen's idea that the press follow a "citizens agenda" in 2020. Why not more reporting on the problems voters care about and how candidates propose to solve them?

There are obvious responses to all this: Many voters knew who Trump was and voted for him anyway because they disliked Clinton even more; the critics just don't like the way the election turned out; and many of our fellow citizens are so stuck in "media bubbles" that what mainstream journalism does won't matter.

But whatever their merits, these assertions come down to a denial of responsibility. The mainstream media still greatly influence how we talk to each other about politics and should take this responsibility seriously.

Consider just two examples. A video of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's collegiate dancing made for fun stories, but it's far less important than the New York Democrat's proposal for a 70 percent tax rate on incomes of over $10 million. Coverage of Trump's 2016 attacks on Jeb Bush for his "low energy" were a successful distraction from a serious conversation about Bush's prophetic assertion that Trump would be a "chaos president."

None of this takes away from the fact that journalists still provide an abundance of accurate information. This includes, thank goodness, smart and tough coverage of Trump.

But Bruni, Sullivan, Patterson and Rosen are right to ask the media to ponder what role it has played in bringing our democracy to its current state. The arbiters of the news should be encouraging better conversations over those back fences -- and doing a better job of warning us early on about politicians who lie even about their lies.

'St. Elsewhere' creator John Falsey dies in IC

Texto completo: John Falsey the co-creator of multiple acclaimed television shows including "Northern Exposure" and "St. Elsewhere" and a University of Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate, died earlier this month in Iowa City.
Falsey died at 4:56 p.m. Jan. 3 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, according to Johnson County Medical Examiner's office administrative director Clayton Schuneman. He died of blunt force trauma to the head, and his death was ruled an accident. He was 67.
Falsey's brother James told The New York Times last weekend that he died due to injuries sustained during a fall at his Iowa City house. They reported that Falsey had been living in town for the past five years and was writing short stories and a novella.
He was also set to executive produce a new revival of his beloved comedy drama "Northern Exposure," as reported by Variety last November.
Through his work creating, writing and producing television in the 1980s and 1990s, Falsey's shows were praised for mixing eccentric wit and characters with stirring drama that proved to be both critically acclaimed as well as popular.
Along with his creative partner Joshua Brand, Falsey won three Emmy Awards. In 1992, he won for Outstanding Drama Series as a producer of "Northern Exposure," along with Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries or Special for "I'll Fly Away." He and Brand also won an Emmy for Outstanding Miniseries for "A Year in the Life" in 1987.
Falsey graduated from the Iowa Writer's Workshop in 1978, during an era of the workshop that featured the likes of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jane Smiley, science fiction master Joe Haldeman and other Iowa literary luminaries.
Soon after, he started a writing job for "The White Shadow," the Emmy-winning drama starring Ken Howard as a white, former professional basketball player coaching a mostly black city high school.
After "The White Shadow" ended, Falsey and Brand created the medical drama "St. Elsewhere." The show, one of the most acclaimed television dramas of the 20th century, would go on to win 13 Emmy Awards, launched the careers of actors like Denzel Washington and Mark Harmon and showcased one of the most talked-about, and controversial, series finale endings in television history.
The series ended with the titular hospital being shown inside of a snow globe.
TV and film critic Matt Zoller Seitz wrote last year on the 30th anniversary of the "St. Elsewhere's" finale that the show "wove in commentary on the process of writing, producing and airing a television show, and sometimes characters would round a corner and come face-to-face with a metaphor for the creative process." The show ran from 1982 to 1988.
In 1990, Falsey and Brand created "Northern Exposure," a seven-time Emmy Award-winning comedy and drama show centering on a recently graduated doctor who set up his practice in the small fictional town of Cicely, Alaska. The show ran from 1990 to 1995.
Both "I'll Fly Away" and "Northern Exposure" were co-produced by David Chase. Four years after the Alaska-set show ended, Chase created HBO's defining drama "The Sopranos." Fellow UI graduates Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess would go on to win numerous Emmy awards for their work on the hit mafia drama.
Falsey later co-created and produced the Steven Spielberg-backed anthology show "Amazing Stories." The last show Falsey produced was "Providence," a family drama that ran from 1999 to 2004.
Falsey was born in New Haven, Connecticut and graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1975.

Texto completo: "Schitt's Creek" returns for its fifth season with a special two-episode premiere, and all 10 episodes of YouTube's original series "Wayne" are available to stream.

What's on TV
SCHITT'S CREEK 10 p.m. on Pop. When we last saw the Roses, they seemed to be actually liking Schitt's Creek, the small town that the formerly wealthy family landed in after being defrauded by their business manager. They were still living in adjoining rooms at the Rosebud Motel, which the patriarch, Johnny, now co-owns with Stevie, and visiting Twyla at the Café Tropical, but over all, things were looking up. David and Alexis found love, and Moira even seems to have gotten her acting career somewhat back on track. On Wednesday, the comedy, created by the father-and-son team Eugene and Dan Levy, returns for its fifth season with a special two-episode premiere, reuniting fans with an uncharacteristically happy Rose clan.
EQUUS: STORY OF THE HORSE 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Dogs might be considered man's best friend, but horses and humans have a long and storied history. The anthropologist Niobe Thompson takes a deep dive into the species' origins, emotional intelligence and connection with humans in this special two-part "Nature" series on PBS, which was filmed over 18 months across three continents.
What's Streaming
WAYNE on YouTube Premium. Described by YouTube as an "action comedy and a punk-rock teen romance," this original series follows 16-year-old Wayne (Mark McKenna) as he travels from Boston to Florida on a dirt bike to retrieve a stolen 1978 Trans Am his ailing father wanted to leave him after his death. But before he sets off, he grabs a pair of nunchucks and his new crush, Del (Ciara Bravo), whose meathead brothers eventually come looking for them.
SEX EDUCATION on Netflix. If you're in the mood for more teenage angst, check out this new comedy starring Gillian Anderson and Asa Butterfield as a very open sex therapist and her teenage son, Otis, who discovers he has a surprising talent for helping his peers navigate the awkward obstacles that come with dating and having sex for the first time. With help from his best friend, Eric (Ncuti Gatwa), who's gay, and his crush, Maeve (Emma Mackey), Otis turns his skill into a side hustle, charging sexually frustrated "clients" for his guidance, despite having his own set of intimate issues. In his review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik named the show a Critic's Pick, and called it "a little bit 'Masters of Sex,' a little bit 'Doogie Howser, XXX.' But it blooms, over eight episodes, into a smart, sensitive look at teens finding their place and figuring out the owner's manuals for their bodies."
AMERICAN GANGSTER (2007) stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes and Google Play. This Ridley Scott-directed cat-and-mouse crime drama follows the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a heroin smuggler who ran the Harlem crime scene in the late 1960s and early '70s, and the New Jersey detective, Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), who tries to take him down.

Trump makes his critics insane: White House burger buffet edition

Texto completo: We are more than two years into the Trump presidency, and his opponents still haven’t figured out that criticizing absolutely everything he says and does actually doesn't turn people against him. You’d think the president's critics in politics and news media would understand by now that nitpicking him over silly issues makes them look small and petty, accomplishing the exact opposite of attracting converts.

But you’d be wrong.

Yes, the White House served burgers, chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets, salad, pizza, and french fries this week to the 2018 national college football champions. Yes, Trump bragged about paying to feed the Clemson Tigers out of pocket (there’s a shutdown, you know). Yes, the president exaggerated in his usual hyperbolic way about the amount of McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Domino's, and Burger King served this week and how much it cost him.

Maybe burgers and pizza are not the sort of spread one would expect from the White House. But the Clemson players appeared to appreciate it, and everyone seemed happy. So, who cares, really? The most this incident deserves is maybe an eye roll. Maybe.

But this is the era of Trump, and most of his critics in the news media are nuts, so of course the Clemson dinner has sparked a serious, mostly humorless response from reporters and pundits.

New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, for example, tweeted the perfect gotcha, writing: "So Trump served Burger King and called it ‘great American food.’ Am I the only one who thought to do a little research? Burger King is owned by 3G Capital, which is ... Brazilian.”

Ah, yes. Who hasn’t taken a bite from a Whopper and thought, “This is Brazilian food!”?

And this keen fact-checker wasn't about to let the president get away with it!

The Washington Post, meanwhile, published an analysis titled, “President Trump’s extravagant, $3,000, 300-sandwich celebration of Clemson University,” exploring just how many sandwiches were served and what it likely cost the president. The “detailed Washington Post analysis” includes charts, graphs, and investigations of wire photos and social media posts. The article is clearly written in jest, but at nearly 1,000 words long, the author is maybe just a bit too committed to the gag, which ultimately is about proving whether the president is a liar and a skinflint. And all because the White House served burgers.

Then, there’s Vox, which used the meal and the president’s subsequent remarks as an opportunity to launch into a broader discussion about his tendency to lie.

On Monday, Trump told the players, “we have 300 hamburgers, many, many French fries — all of our favorite foods.” Tuesday morning, he tweeted that he paid for “over 1000 hamberders [sic] etc.”

For Vox, the discrepancy between the numbers suggests a more serious problem. “This particular exaggeration isn’t a big deal in and of itself, obviously,” the author claims in an article titled, “Trump’s tweet about ‘hamberders’ illustrates just how effortlessly he lies.”

The author adds, “But it does reflect how effortlessly Trump fibs about everything from steel plants to Democrats’ position on the shutdown to ‘hamberders.’”

For the record, the president also said that the stack of burgers was “piled up a mile high.” As the Post very helpfully noted Tuesday, that can’t possibly be true.

"At two inches each, a thousand burgers would not reach one mile high. Had Trump instead invested his entire net worth — $3.1 billion per Forbes last year — on $5 sandwiches, each two inches high? A stack of hamburgers nearly 20,000 miles high," the Post noted.

Thank God for this press.

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, bashed fellow GOP Reps. Liz Cheney and Kevin McCarthy in an interview after the House passed a resolution that rejected all forms of hateful expression.

The resolution was introduced by House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., to specifically call out King for comments he made to the New York Times that many say are racist.

“I will tell you if there is support out there for Liz Cheney after this, you can’t put her in a category of ever being a conservative again,” King told the Ed Martin Movement radio show after the Wyoming congresswoman called for his resignation Tuesday morning.

“She called for my resignation, she’s been here for two years. What would give her the moral authority or the intellectual judgment to do something like that?” King said.

He said fellow Republican lawmakers have expressed their respect and admiration for him, and he also heard from people of his home district.

“We’re getting a lot of support from the district, they’re starting to realize what Kevin McCarthy did,” King said.

On Monday, McCarthy, the House minority leader from California, voted alongside other House Republicans to strip King of all committee assignments.

"We will not be seating Steve King on any committees in the 116th Congress," McCarthy told reporters after meeting with the House GOP steering committee. "It was a unanimous decision by steering in light of the comments. These are not the first time we've heard these comments."

The fallout came after a New York Times story was published in which King asked when the terms “white supremacist” and “white nationalist” become offensive.

It is expected that he will lose his post on the House Judiciary Committee, including the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, the House Agriculture Committee, and the Small Business Committee.

New Gloucester lawmaker seeks to ban 'obscene' material from public schools

Resumen: The Republican lawmaker introduced a bill that would revise a state law governing the dissemination of obscene material to minors to remove an exception for educational purposes that allows public schools to use obscene matter. Arata said that college students and adults should have access to Murakami’s novel, but its “very vivid descriptions” of sexual scenes make it inappropriate for public school students, especially given the consequences that could follow from reading rape scenes that falsely portray the crime as potentially pleasurable. The obscenity law doesn’t apply to noncommercial distribution or exhibition “for purely educational purposes by any library, art gallery, museum, public school, private school or institution of higher learning, nor to any commercial distribution or exhibition by any art gallery or museum.”

Texto completo: AUGUSTA — When her teenage son came home from school toting a book titled “Kafka on the Shore,” Amy Arata of New Gloucester decided she ought to give it a read.
What she found within the pages of the 2002 novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami appalled her.
“It was very, very specific and graphic,” Arata said, and at one point made it seem as though a woman desired rape.
Arata, who was elected in 2018 as state representative for House District 65, is taking steps to try to make sure books she considers obscene don’t wind up in the hands of schoolchildren.
The Republican lawmaker introduced a bill that would revise a state law governing the dissemination of obscene material to minors to remove an exception for educational purposes that allows public schools to use obscene matter.
She has support for her bill from Sen. Scott Cyrway, R-Benton, and Rep. John Martin, D-Eagle Lake. Her measure will likely be considered by the Legislature’s Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety.
Arata said that college students and adults should have access to Murakami’s novel, but its “very vivid descriptions” of sexual scenes make it inappropriate for public school students, especially given the consequences that could follow from reading rape scenes that falsely portray the crime as potentially pleasurable.
The book she is targeting is widely considered a modern-day classic, included on The New York Times list of the 10 best books of 2005 for a translation by Philip Gabriel.
It brings readers into a world where, as one teacher put it, “cats talk, fish fall from the sky, and spirits slip out of their bodies to make love or commit murder.”
Author John Updike, one of America’s most famous novelists, called it a “real page-turner, as well as an insistently metaphysical mind-bender.”
But it has its critics as well.
The novel is banned for sale in Hong Kong, where it carries a “Class II: indecent” classification reserved for what authorities call obscene materials. What that means in practical terms is that the book can’t be distributed to anyone under the age of 18 and has to be sealed in a wrapper with printed warnings.
Maine law defines obscene materials as items that appeal “to the prurient interest” in the opinion of average people applying contemporary community standards “with respect to what is suitable material for minors, considered as a whole.”
Obscene material “lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value,” the law says, and “depicts or describes, in a patently offensive manner, ultimate sexual acts, excretory functions, masturbation or lewd exhibition of the genitals.”
The obscenity law doesn’t apply to noncommercial distribution or exhibition “for purely educational purposes by any library, art gallery, museum, public school, private school or institution of higher learning, nor to any commercial distribution or exhibition by any art gallery or museum.”
Arata’s bill would simply strip away the exception for a public school.
She said public schools shouldn’t be handing obscene material to students.
“It’s not about banning books,” she said. It’s about making sure that students are given age-appropriate materials they can learn from.
The obscenity law established “a really high bar” that doesn’t apply to much. She said she has no interest in pushing classics out of the classroom.
But, Arata said, she doesn’t want teenagers reading graphic descriptions of rape scenes that might give them a false idea of the horror involved in the crime.
She said the Murakami book’s lewdness is so extreme that “I don’t know how I’m going to testify on this book. I’m not going to get up there and read it.”
She said her proposal is “just a common-sense bill” to rein in the most extreme volumes.
Not everybody agrees with her, though.
A 2017 column by two students in The Clarion, the school paper for Grover Cleveland High School in Portland, Oregon, admitted the novel has graphic, troubling scenes that their teacher should have warned the class about.
But, they said, “when you read ‘Kafka on the Shore,’ it will become clear that this novel is more than its few graphic scenes.”
They said the volume “illustrates themes of destiny and family through displays of personal pleasure and violence.”
“None of these topics should be new to any high school student,” wrote Ariel Harmon and Brooklyn Pierce, who were juniors when they read the book.
“Similar scenes are common throughout books, shows, and movies that appeal to the demographic of high school students,” they said. “And seeing that many high schoolers are in tune with what is happening in the real world outside of the boundaries of Cleveland, the events that transpired in this novel are nothing we have not seen before.”
Arata said that when she read it, she found its obscenity outweighed any possible value for students who are still minors.
As a member of the School Administrative District 15 board of directors, she said, she spoke with the superintendent and a teacher about the assignment and the book was ultimately withdrawn from classroom use.
But, she said, it was just lucky that she happened to pick up the volume and read it.
It shouldn’t be so easy for something so offensive to wind up as a class assignment, she said. Changing the law is one way to tackle the problem, Arata said.
Before her bill can advance, it will be the subject of a public hearing, not yet scheduled, and would need to win a majority of both houses of the Legislature and Gov. Janet Mills.

Let the sealing begin

Texto completo: Pennsylvania state court officials are preparing a massive initiative that could pave the way for courts across the country to offer people convicted of minor offenses a fresh start outside the shadow of their past.
In late June, Pennsylvania officials plan to begin running a computer program that will flag an estimated several hundred thousand old non-violent misdemeanor and summary convictions as well as cases that did not result in convictions for removal from the public record under the state's new Clean Slate law.
The law -- the first of its kind in the nation -- passed the General Assembly last summer with only two no votes.
The law is designed to help people who did their time, paid their fines, stayed out of trouble and found themselves facing hurdles to housing and employment as the result of an old record, said attorney Tom Farrell, vice chairman of the Allegheny County Bar Association's criminal defense section.
"We have people 50 or 60 years old who have been in jobs forever, and in the 1970s or 1980s they were involved in something and had a conviction (and) no one knew about it. Now the company is getting bought out and the new owners want to run a background check on everyone, and they're back to square
one," Farrell said. "We heard from one person who was working in a place where they fire people with any kind of theft, and that person was scared to death because they actually did the firing and had a theft record from way back when."
How it works
Criminal records have always been a public record. Until the advent of online court dockets, however, those wishing to access them had to visit the courthouse where they were kept.
Pennsylvania's unified online court dockets made it simple for anyone to check old records. Short of hiring an attorney and persuading a judge to expunge the record, even charges that did not result in a conviction became available online for anyone to see with a few keystrokes.
Under the Clean Slate law, records flagged by the court will be sent to the Pennsylvania State Police. The police agency must sign off on moves to seal records. Records will not be destroyed, only removed from the public docket.
And those thousands of paper records filed away in courthouses across the state? Well, it's not exactly clear how they will be handled.
The office of Westmoreland County Clerk of Courts Bryan Kline dockets about 6,500 to 6,600 criminal cases a year. He said he's been led to believe his office will continue to maintain the physical files but that they will not be available to the public.
All of the sealed files will remain accessible to law enforcement agencies.
The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts is scheduled to begin running an automated program to flag files for sealing on June 28. Officials warn they may not get through the backlog in the first year.
In the meantime, people whose records are eligible for sealing may petition the courts to act immediately.
Wide support
Greensburg lawyer Tim Andrews, a former assistant district attorney, said he has already had many inquiries about it. Andrews said the new law should not harm anyone. But it will allow some people who made a mistake as a young adult to move forward.
Sharon Dietrich, the Community Legal Services lawyer who penned the Clean Slate law, works in the office's employment section in Philadelphia. She said the office has heard from 10,000 people dealing with such issues over the past several years.
"And that's probably just the tip of the iceberg," she said.
Dietrich said the estimated volume of cases eligible statewide is so large that the only thing that could make it work is automation.
In many states, each county has a separate computer system. But Pennsylvania, with its unified court system, has a single computer system that can tackle the project. Even so, Gov. Tom Wolf, one of the law's most ardent supporters, warns the start-up will be complicated.
Special interest groups as diverse as the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity on the right and the left-leaning Center for American Progress have lauded the Clean Slate Act.
More help needed
Pennsylvania legislators passed the law as state and federal lawmakers across the country tackled various aspects of criminal justice reform, ranging from reducing tough mandatory minimum sentences to addressing job training and education to prepare inmates for release in the hope of reducing recidivism.
In New York, state lawmakers passed a similar law that extended the opportunity to have a record sealed to individuals with a single felony. Unlike Pennsylvania, where all cases eventually will be flagged automatically, New York required people to petition the courts.
As of May, when the law had been on the books for seven months, the New York Times found that the records of only 346 people had been sealed.
"When it's not automatic, people may not know that the opportunity exists and people are left with the burden -- and potentially the cost of trying to hire a lawyer -- to submit a sealing application," said Alison Wilkey, public policy director at the Prisoner Reentry Institute at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
"Briefly, these sealing initiatives are an incredibly important way of expanding opportunity for the 70 million Americans who have criminal records. We all believe in redemption, but people who have been arrested or convicted of a crime are punished for life even though they have served their sentence and paid their debt to society. This means people have a problem getting jobs, supporting their families and finding housing," Wilkey said.
Some say reformers are only beginning to recognize the impact of laws that fed the explosion of Pennsylvania's prison population from 7,600 in 1979 to 47,370, four decades later.
New Kensington defense attorney Dan Joseph, who began practicing law at the beginning of that era, said the Clean Slate law is a small start.
Joseph said prosecutors could have an impact without changing the law by simply thinking twice about whether to charge a crime as a felony on a first offense. Unlike misdemeanors, felonies are not eligible for sealing under the new law.
"One of the problems we have right now is these young people get tabbed with felonies and it haunts them the rest of their lives. Felonies are tossed around like they don't matter in court," Joseph said.
Prosecutors often have an option to file a misdemeanor instead, he said.
"I always ask, 'Why do you want the felony when you could use your discretion and go for the misdemeanor?'" Joseph said. "And why not make the wait (for Clean Slate eligibility) five years instead of 10?
"To me, the Clean Slate is like a piece of salt on a mountain of what needs to be done to allow people to get their lives back once they've done their time."

The FBI is playing politics with Donald Trump: Today's talker

Texto completo: The New York Times reported Friday that after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the bureau began to investigate whether Trump was "knowingly working for Russia or had unwittingly fallen under Moscow’s influence. "
This isn't newsworthy
By Arthur I. Cyr
The report in The New York Times and elsewhere of the FBI's focus on Russian influence on President Donald Trump has news media center stage, but is the item really so newsworthy? Yes, but not for the reasons usually given.
According to the reports, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, some in the agency began investigating whether the president was “working on behalf of Russia. ” Trying to do business in Russia, while a candidate for president of the United States, is stupid but not illegal.
Talker: Don't forget Republicans are responsible for Trump's shutdown
Sign-up for Today's Talker newsletter here
Then, after intelligence arose that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, special counsel Robert Mueller was formally appointed to investigate Russian involvement in the Trump campaign. The Justice Department, which includes the FBI, initiated this. The separate informal efforts by the FBI, if true, indicate malice as well as vigilantism.
The latest “news” provides Trump further ammunition to condemn Washington institutions and reinforce his committed public base. Along with the government shutdown over border security, this can be an applause theme for his 2020 re-election campaign.
But a more significant story is the long-term deterioration of the FBI. The partisan behavior exemplified by FBI representatives regarding Trump shouldn't be tolerated.
That's the real news story.
Arthur I. Cyr is the director of the A. W. Clausen Center for World Business at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin. You can reach him at acyr@carthage. edu
What others are saying
Asha Rangappa, The Washington Post: "If the counterintelligence case against the president was eventually closed because it found that Donald Trump did not pose a threat to U. S. national security, Trump should welcome special counsel Robert Mueller’s report reaching Congress. This conclusion would stop the speculation about Trump’s relationship with Russia and reassure the American public that his loyalties remain with the United States. But if it wasn’t, and the threat to national security is ongoing, then informing Congress of the nature of the threat is paramount. This would be the only way that Congress can determine whether it should take the ultimate step to neutralize the damage that the president could inflict on the nation — through impeachment and removal from office. "
Alan M. Dershowitz, The Hill: "The issue I am raising, which is the propriety of a special counsel report including information and opinions regarding alleged noncriminal political sins, is worthy of serious nonpartisan discussion. It goes to the proper functions of the FBI, prosecutors, special counsels and grand juries in a democracy that subjects them to checks and balances. This important national debate should take place before Mueller concludes his report. "
Andrew McCarthy, FoxNews. com: "After Trump was elected, the FBI realized that Trump was soon going to have access to government intelligence files. If they honestly told the president-elect that they had been investigating his campaign in hope of making a case on him, they had to be concerned that he would shut the investigation down and clean house at the FBI and Department of Justice. So, they misleadingly told him the investigation was about Russia and a few stray people in his campaign, but they assured him he personally was not under investigation. This was not true. The investigation was always hoping to find something on Trump. "
What our readers are saying
Almost two years of investigations and not a shred of criminal evidence presented against President Donald Trump. Only rehashing old news, harassing his associates, or punishing associates of old crimes that should have been brought up a long time ago.
— Jeffrey Lyons
No doubt Trump is compromised. No innocent person would act the way he acts when it comes to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has never attacked Putin but has attacked everyone from Pope Francis to President Barack Obama . . . and the FBI, Chief Justice John Roberts, the court and leaders of our Western allies.
— Abraham Eseku
When Trump was asked if he was a Russian agent, he could only say he was insulted. No "yes" or "no" response from him.
— Sam Nada
Interesting how many of the think pieces against Trump use terms like "suggest," "point to," "imply," "potential" or "seems to. " I'm not a Trump fan, but I'll wait for definitive proof to be presented.

Texto completo: By insisting on a border wall, President Trump is emphasizing an issue that may be popular with his base but seems unlikely to attract new supporters.
There has been little polling since the government shutdown began last month, but what there is indicates that voters oppose a border wall, blame the president for the shutdown, believe the shutdown will have adverse consequences and don't believe the government should be shut down over the wall.
The wall has consistently been unpopular, with voters opposed by around a 20-point margin over months of national surveys. That makes it even less popular than the president himself.
Support for the wall is closely tied to support for the president, though. Over all, polls show it consistently tracks just a few points beneath the president's approval rating, and support for the wall is almost exclusively confined to voters who already support the president.
In New York Times Upshot/Siena College polls of eight battleground congressional districts this past fall, 89 percent of voters' views on the president and the wall were aligned, more than any other issues except the tax bill and the Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination.
The relationship between support for the president and the wall is so tight that it's hard not to wonder whether, at least for now, support for the wall is simply a function of support for the president. In other words, attitudes about President Trump might drive attitudes about the wall, rather than the other way around. It wouldn't be much of a surprise, given how strongly voters feel about the president and the extent that he's emphasized the issue.
It's hard to see how the issue can be used to help him win re-election. Midterm exit poll data, election results, voter file data and pre-election polls indicate that the president's approval rating is below 50 percent in states worth at least 317 electoral votes (270 are needed to win).
That's actually a relatively healthy number for the president compared with his national approval rating (around 41 percent), but it could be a conservative estimate, and voters' views might be unusually entrenched, given the stability of his ratings.
Many presidents have won re-election after a midterm drubbing, and Mr. Trump's approval rating isn't particularly far from what he may wind up needing, given the G.O.P.'s current advantage in the Electoral College. But the wall has not helped so far.
Data from the Fox News Voter Analysis of the midterms, a new competitor to the traditional exit polls, indicated that a majority of voters opposed the wall in states worth nearly 400 electoral votes, including in several states where the president's approval rating was above water in the poll, like Ohio and Florida.
There is tentative evidence in the Fox data that the wall is particularly unpopular in the relatively white and rural West, but somewhat more popular, at least with respect to the president's approval rating, in the Northeast and inland South. This would follow a familiar pattern in American politics: It mirrors the president's support in the presidential primary and tracks with longstanding measures of racial resentment.
Even so, the wall still isn't popular in Michigan or Pennsylvania, important battleground states. And voters in Ohio, a politically similar state, opposed the wall.
None of these polls account for the government shutdown, but attitudes about it are unlikely to be particularly fluid, given the lack of movement on the wall during the Trump presidency. Tying the issue to an unpopular shutdown seems particularly unlikely to help and, historically, voters tend to drift against the policy preferences of the president's party. That's already evident on immigration more generally: Polls show voters more supportive of immigration than ever before.
For all of the focus on the president's base over the last two years, there is not much reason to think that the base, alone, is enough for the president to win re-election in a one-on-one race against a viable Democratic candidate. This could change. It has before. But with the midterms over, this is now the central political challenge facing the president. By that measure, it's hard to see where a shutdown over the wall fits in.

Texto completo: I took my teenager to the DMV this week to get his license. I can’t help but feel as if we got away with something — if not a crime, then at least somebody’s better judgment.
When we got to the front of the line, the worker (whose cheery disposition broke all stereotypes about DMV employees) pointed to the chair right next to her so my son could get his picture taken.
“Have a seat,” she said.
Without looking up from his phone, he sat down in one of the general chairs people wait in. The employee and I exchanged looks.
“When do you think he’ll notice?” she said.
“Probably just around never o’clock,” I answered.
“I have one of those, too,” she said, and an unspoken bond passed between us. We are mothers of unobservant teenagers.
This was after weeks of anticipation. He took the test at his high school, then claimed that meant he had his license. I asked to see it. He was all, “It’s not a physical license.” I was all, “Then it’s not a license.”
If complete obliviousness is a talent, then my son is the most talented kid around. It invites the existential question: If it’s not on an electronic screen, does it truly exist?
One time, a few years back, I sent him into the grocery store to buy milk. He came out 10 minutes later, empty-handed.
“They don’t have any,” he said with a shrug.
“They do,” I said. “It’s a grocery store. Milk is one of those things they definitely have.”
“I couldn’t find it.”
“OK, so, I’m just going to throw some things out there, and see if you can come up with any ideas. Milk is refrigerated. Did you see a refrigerator?”
“Yes.”
“Here’s another thing. There are employees inside that building whose job descriptions include knowing where the milk is.”
Needless to say, now I do the grocery shopping alone.
Back to the DMV, where my son finally found the right chair.
“1, 2, 3,” the employee said.
My kid did this pursed lip thing, and I think he thinks doing it makes him look like Snoop, but really it makes it look like he’s lost a grape in his mouth. Then he moved on to the vision test, and after he passed, he said, “I totally aced that.”
Then he stood up and started to leave.
“Um, do you think you’re forgetting something?” I asked.
“Oh yeah. My license.”
“Yes, not just a small detail, but pretty much our entire reason for being here.”
Then, the employee, who’s observed the whole thing from the beginning, did the strangest thing. She actually gave him a license. I wanted to say, “Weren’t you here for the whole chair thing? And now you expect him to notice things like, I don’t know, stop signs?”
I felt a similar feeling when they handed him to me 16 years ago and then the hospital just let me leave. With a baby! They checked no references, tested for no motherhood qualifications. They just gave me the baby.
We got his license and got into the car, where he proceeded to alert the world of his accomplishment, because heaven forbid he has his license for five minutes without Snapchatting it. I started in on a lecture about how with great license comes great responsibility.
The pièce de résistance of my speech: Teenagers are dumb.
“But Mom, I’m a teenager.”
“I know, so it’s important for you to know this. You are dumb. And the worst part is you think you’re smart. Don’t feel bad. I was dumb once too. It has to do with our brains trying to catch up with our bodies.”
As he was relaying this conversation to his father, he left out all of the details except one fact.
“I’m dumb.”
And that’s the smartest thing he’s said in a very long time.
So good luck, fellow drivers — there’s another green newbie on the road. And feel free to adapt the “You’re dumb” speech for your own teenagers. It’s easy to remember.

Texto completo: In the fall of 2016, American diplomats in Cuba complained of high-pitched sounds that were leading to headaches, vertigo, and hearing loss. A recording, made by diplomats and circulated by the Associated Press, fueled speculation about a sonic attack by adversaries of the United States. But two scientists, Alexander Stubbs of the University of California, Berkeley, and Fernando Montealegre-Z of the University of Lincoln in England, now say the evidence points to a more benign source: crickets. They're quick to say they can't rule out an attack altogether. But the sound they examined doesn't match up with that hypothesis. “All I can say fairly definitively is that the A.P.-released recording is of a cricket," Stubbs told The New York Times, “and we think we know what species it is." That would be the Indies short-tailed cricket (or a close relative), known for making an enormous racket.

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

Facebook scandal: We can't trust Big Tech

Texto completo: The same tech companies that swear up and down that they don't censor and deplatform conservative voices also claim they keep your private info private — even when they get caught.
The New York Times recently caught social media giant Facebook in its biggest lie yet. After Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told the world his company doesn't "sell data to advertisers" and told Congress that users have "complete control" over their data, internal documents and whistleblowers revealed that Facebook has allowed companies like Spotify, Netflix, and the Royal Bank of Canada to read and even edit your private personal messages.
Even after being caught red-handed, Facebook argues that this gross violation of privacy isn't a problem, claiming that users consented to let other companies read their private messages by agreeing to Facebook's terms of use.
I don't know about you, but when I clicked "agree" after scrolling through those seemingly endless reams of legal jargon, I never imagined that I might also be giving Canadian bankers permission to hijack my messages.
It's not just users who are being subjected to Facebook's chicanery; the company's executives seem to think they're pulling the wool over federal regulators' eyes, too. Facebook was already subject to a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission in order to settle charges that it deceived customers about the privacy of their data. This latest scandal may well run afoul of that agreement.
David Vladeck, former head of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, certainly thinks it does.
"This is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it," he told The New York Times. "I don't understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree."
It would be one thing if this kind of arrogance and dishonesty were confined to Facebook, but it's not; it's pervasive among Silicon Valley's would-be aristocrats. Just this past September, Google — Facebook's biggest rival in the internet advertisement game — got caught letting other tech giants into customers' Gmail accounts.
Google has the same instincts under pressure as Facebook. Like Facebook, the search giant's strategy is to lie about and obscure practices that they know Americans are uncomfortable with. Then, when they get caught, they act as if we're too stupid and ignorant about their technology to notice, like Google CEO Sundar Pichai did in his testimony before Congress.
The same games that Big Tech companies play with our privacy, they also play with our political system.
Zuckerberg swears up and down that there is no bias against conservatives at Facebook — even after being caught changing algorithms in ways that transfer ad revenue from conservatives to liberals, repeatedly banning popular pro-Trump pages, and, in the crucial weeks before the midterm elections, pulling Republicans' campaign ads without warning.
Similarly, Pichai claimed, under oath, that Google operates "without political bias" — even after leaked emails showed Google employees bragging about manipulating searches to boost Hispanic turnout for Hillary Clinton in swing states in 2016, and discussing how best to alter algorithms to punish the conservative outlets that were breaking these stories about their bias.
Luckily for Big Tech executives, they can rely on Democrats like incoming House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to provide cover for their deceptions. Nadler, whose biggest campaign donor is Google parent Alphabet, calls anti-conservative bias a "right-wing conspiracy theory."
The fact is, we can't trust Big Tech or their Democratic allies — not on privacy and not on bias.

Texto completo: Richard E. Mooney, a former New York Times columnist who served as executive editor of The Hartford Courant for five years, died Wednesday night at the age of 91.
Mooney shepherded The Courant during the landmark years of 1976 to 1981, coinciding with the shuttering of The Hartford Times and The Courant's $105.6 million sale to the Times Mirror company, ending its independence as a locally-owned paper.
He spent more than 40 years as a journalist, his time at The Courant book-ended by long careers at The New York Times as a reporter, foreign correspondent, assistant editor and editorial board member.
"His passion was the New York Times, and The Hartford Courant when he was editor there," his son, Steve Mooney, said. "His passion was the news and his passion was getting it right. He took language seriously, he took facts seriously, he took journalistic standards seriously."
Until he suffered complications from a long battle with cancer, he was living independently in New York City. Even recently, Mooney was taking regular trains to visit his alma mater, Yale University, where he compiled several exhibits on the Yale Daily News, Revolutionary War figure Nathan Hale and the naming of Yale's 12 original colleges.
Mooney was born in Plainfield, N.J., to Wandell M. Mooney, a banker, and Alice Joy Mooney. He briefly served in the U.S. Navy at age 18, but as World War II came to a close, he went on to Yale, where he became managing editor of the Yale Daily News.
He graduated in 1947, and spent a year as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, going on to work for the United Press and, in 1956, The New York Times.
Over 19 years, he worked as an economics reporter in Washington, D.C., and New York and a foreign correspondent in Paris, with his wife, Elizabeth Coleman Mooney, and sons Jim, Steve and John in tow. He returned to the city as deputy foreign editor and deputy financial editor, until a serendipitous phone call from a cousin - and head hunter - led him to Hartford.
The cousin had been commissioned to find the next editor for The Courant and wanted to know if Mooney had any suggestions, according to former Courant editor and historian Joseph Nunes. Mooney gave him a few names, and then threw in his one.
He got the top job.
"It was a personal accomplishment for him to be leading a paper, and especially one with that kind of history to it," said his son, John Mooney, founder of an online policy publication NJ Spotlight. "I think he wore that really proudly and seriously. There was no chance it would falter under his watch."
His oldest son, Jim Mooney, remembers his parents searching for a home in the West End, near the town line, and his father insisting they have a Hartford address.
"He said, 'I have to live in Hartford, we can't live on that side of the street because it's West Hartford," Jim said.
It was his first act as a cheerleader of Hartford, which was approaching the 1980s renaissance that would see the peak years of Whalers fandom and the tripling of office space downtown. His wife, who died in 2003, also went on to work as a tutor and learning specialist at Watkinson School in Hartford and Renbrook School in West Hartford.
But his first test came just one month into the post, when the shuttering of the Hartford Times in October 1976 left The Courant the only newspaper in the capital city. Immediately, Mooney called for the first the creation of an Op-Ed page, something that would increase the paper's interaction with its readers and help maintain the balance and diversity of voices the two papers had been supplying.
Mooney went on to court two key hires to the desk, editorial page editor John Zakarian, who gave 27 years to The Courant, and the paper's first and only political cartoonist Bob Englehart, who stayed 35 years.
In interviews with Nunes, Mooney recalled how he and Zakarian pushed back against publisher Ed Downes over who the paper would endorse for president in 1980 - Democrat Jimmy Carter, as he and Zakarian wanted, or Downes' choice, Republican Ronald Reagan.
"He wouldn't hear of endorsing the Democrat," Mooney told Nunes. He offered an alternative. "I went in and negotiated with him to endorse John Anderson, the independent. He agreed to it."
"I think he got a kick out of that," John Mooney said.
In his short time with The Courant, Mooney oversaw a $9 million expansion project, the growth of the paper's state desk to 110 reporters, copy editors and correspondents, and modernization that brought a more advanced typesetting system and replaced typewriters with desktop computers.
He also helped The Courant weather one of its greatest challenges, the end of the paper's proud history of local ownership. At the urging of hundreds of employee stakeholders, the board agreed in 1979 to be purchased by the Times Mirror company for $105.6 million.
Many felt a sale was inevitable, as the Courant's stock continued to rise with the paper's growth. In 1978, The Courant had a daily circulation of 215,385, a Sunday circulation of 288,186, and earnings of about $3.7 million on revenues of $53 million.
And already, Mooney had made signfiicant changes - charging for obituaries, expanding the feature's department, introducing a Sunday Connecticut page and reformatted Sunday business and finance section, and sending reporters to report on national, and international, stories like sending then-religion editor Colin McEnroe to Rome for the election of Pope John Paul I in 1978.
"The Courant had not done anything like this," McEnroe told Nunes. "That was a Dick Mooney kind of thing: If you want to be a big-league newspaper, you've got to do some of these things."
But just a few years later, the Times Mirror's corporate influence took its toll. In 1981, the company pushed publisher Keith L. McGlade to replace Mooney with Mark Murphy, an editor at The Los Angeles Times
"I think that was very hard for him," said his son, Steve Mooney. "Even though it was a takeover, it wasn't personal, how can you not feel that it's personal?"
"It had been success after success, and then you have someone remove you from your position. It was very difficult."
After turning down several offers to lead other newspapers, Mooney returned to The New York Times as a member of its editorial board. His sons say he welcomed a return to the real work of journalism.
His writings ranged from the serious to the exceptionally lighthearted, with columns lamented the colorizing of classic movies and the joy of collecting loose change on the streets of New York. The latter particularly resonated with readers, who wrote back to share how much money they too had scrounged from taxi cab cushions and sidewalks and gutters.
Often, they reflected his own passions, like an editorial on the two camps of crossword puzzlers - those who accept help, and those who do not.
"This one refuses crutches - dictionaries, gazetteers, kibitzers or, worst of all, crossword dictionaries," he wrote. "Puzzling is not a social sport. Part of the fun lies in unaided accomplishment, part in the splendid isolation. A puzzler puzzling on a New York subway is off in another realm."
Mooney also took great pride in completing the crossword in pen, John says - it played into his passion for the news, for facts, for getting it right.
"He was certainly a superior intellect who I think at [age] 3 knew he was going to be a reporter," John added. "The rest of us struggle their whole life trying to figure out what we're going to be and he just knew it."
It was in New York that he helped Andrew Julien, now publisher and executive editor of The Hartford Courant and a friend of Mooney's sons, get his own start in journalism.
Julien recalls visiting Mooney at his New York office in 1986 and taking in the veteran reporter's advice - to go find a paper where he could cover a community. Mooney put him in touch with the Middletown Press, where Julien went on to cover the towns of Durham and Middlefield.
"I just remember how optimistic and encouraging and positive he was at a time where I didn't know exactly where this journey would land me," Julien said. "I'm still grateful to him for that."
Mooney remained at The New York Times for 15 years, until his retirement at 70 years old.
He continued to live independently in New York City until his death, only once considering a move to assisted living. His sons remember visiting facilities in New York, New Haven and Hartford, but Mooney ultimately chose to stay in his 5th floor apartment at East 67th Street and Lexington Avenue.
He often walked a few blocks north to Neil's, a small, crowded diner outside Hunter College. He took on the ambitious Great Saunter, a hike along Manhattan's 32-miles of shoreline, made near-weekly trips to the opera, and ice skated in Central Park and Rockefeller Center well into his 80s.
He never stopped doing the crossword, digging into history, or following the progress of The Hartford Courant, his sons said.
"He had an intellectual curiosity, and 'How did we get here, where is this taking us.' I think that always was part of his DNA when he was a journalist or after," John Mooney said. "He always had that next question."

LAUSD teachers went on strike in 1989. But are the stakes higher in 2019?

Texto completo: Whether they were stuck in an auditorium or playing long-term hooky, many a school kid old enough to remember the 1989 Los Angeles teachers strike recalls the period as nine days of good old-fashioned lawlessness.
Quoted in a New York Times article at the time, LAPD Lieut. Frank Valdez expressed his concern about “little predators” roaming LA’s downtown streets. “The problem kids are not going to go to school and it’s going to create problems all over, not just on campus,” he said during the strike.
Jamie Todd Rubin, an 11th-grader at Cleveland High School at the time, wistfully remembers weekday ventures to the beach, Valley bowling alleys and movie theatres while his teachers fought for better pay as his personal “golden age.”
Triumphantly, he recalled that “teachers ended up getting what they were looking for too.” In many respects, they did.
By all accounts, teachers succeeded in gleaning higher wages, more administrative control and greater stature for their union from the Los Angeles Unified School District after thousands walked off the job in the spring of 1989.
It was the second teachers strike since the founding of United Teachers Los Angeles in 1970, ushering angst into the city and turmoil to the nation’s second largest school system.
In 1989, the major win for teachers after the walkout that lasted nine days was getting school-based management and shared decision-making into a contract. Around 80 percent of members participated in the strike, and half of LAUSD K-12 students stayed home.

As an army of 30,000 teachers stand ready to form new picket lines on Monday, their demands ring markedly familiar: higher pay, relief from ballooning class sizes, and more nurses, librarians and counselors trained to address the medical and psychological needs of today’s students.
Has much really changed?
Former UTLA President John Perez, who was on the picket lines both as a teacher in 1970, said it this way:
“To be perfectly honest, very little has changed. In 1970 we felt disrespected. In 1989 we felt disrespected. And in 2018 teachers feel disrespected.”
Undercurrents of teacher empowerment were also at the crux of the 1970 strike, UTLA’s first, when around half of the young union’s members went off the job for nearly five weeks.
Then, as now, district officials threatened that acceding to their calls for salary increases would spell financial ruin.
Parallels between ’89 and today run as deep as rhetorical strategy, like the union’s relentless critiques of LA Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner.
“Oh yeah it was a big war in ’89 and the union made superintendent [Leonard] Britton the bad guy,” Perez said. Picketing teachers wore buttons with his face over a lemon, or with a slash over his face. “We called him Lenny the lemon.”
Some have argued all this recurrence is evidence that the lasting effects of earlier strikes have been mixed at best, and that securing lasting public funding for education has proven elusive over the decades.
Former LAUSD elementary school teacher Michael Romo lamented the lack of progress since 1989.
“Back in my day we had nurses, smaller class sizes and maybe even better stocked libraries,” said Romo, director of the California Teachers Association in Burbank and Glendale.
He went on strike in 1989, his first year of bilingual teaching at Norwood Street Elementary School. “For 30 years to come back to the same issue, it’s like we’ve made no progress.”
Of course, things do change in 30 years. Along with overarching economic differences and a friendlier face in the governor’s mansion, a key factor in this looming walkout that appears to have been absent from previous strikes is competing visions for the future of public education.
UCLA Professor John Rogers, director of the university’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, interpreted the current impasse between the district and the union as a reflection of opposite reactions LAUSD’s current financial and enrollment woes.
“The district is thinking about how they can contain costs and deal with a growing charter school sector by devolving the district over time as a portfolio of schools,” he said. “While teachers think the way forward is to more broadly improve the quality of its own educational program, only sometimes acknowledging how much spending that requires.”
The emergence of charter schools in Los Angeles, which are privately managed but publicly funded, have been central to the standoff between district and union leadership.
Perez seems to think this is uncharted territory, particularly what he said was superintendent Beutner’s goals to break up and “privatize” the a time-honored and democratic institution like L.A. Unified.
“The existential threat to public education as we know it is real. That wasn’t there in 1989,” he said. The district’s financial woes this time around also have some experts worried about a state takeover.
“My understanding is after the strike it will appear to be a win for teachers and then the layoffs will come soon after,” said UCLA Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies Pedro Noguera.
Noting LA County’s recent appointment of a fiscal team to the district, he said “That’s my fear, that they’re at risk of being taken over.”
Carmen Romero, special education teacher at South Gate High School, remembers those long days in auditoriums, in the gym and on the football field as a 10th-grader at Bell High School during the 1989 strike.
“We didn’t feel valued as students,” she said about the nine days of boredom. More of a rule-follower, she was on campus every day of the strike.
“But it made me appreciate school more, and feel like I deserve things like desks and respect.” Now that she’s gearing up to get on the picket line as a teacher, “It’s the same feeling.”

Texto completo: S. Korean leader wants action: SEOUL, South Korea — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday that President Donald Trump and his North Korea counterpart, Kim Jong Un, needed to move from "abstract" talk to "concrete" action the next time they meet, to speed up their peace process and bridge mistrust. Moon said Kim’s trip to China this week suggested a U.S.-North Korea summit could be nearing.
King criticized for comments: WASHINGTON — House Republicans on Thursday criticized a fellow GOP lawmaker for making what they said were "racist" comments. Rep. Steve King of Iowa was quoted in The New York Times saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" The comment drew a denunciation from members of House Republican leadership. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican, said King’s remarks were "abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse."
Bracing for unrest in Congo: KINSHASA, Congo — Scores of police with automatic rifles and tear gas launchers were positioned late Thursday along a road in the capital leading to Limete, a stronghold of opposition candidate Martin Fayulu. Fayulu has alleged presidential election fraud in the surprise win of opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi. He has urged the Congolese people to protest. Election results compiled by the powerful Catholic Church and its observers at all polling stations show Fayulu easily won, diplomats say. An Associated Press witness saw a vehicle filled with military personnel in full combat gear. One soldier carried a rocket launcher. Congo has been largely calm since results were announced early Thursday, but observers have warned that a court challenge could lead to unrest.
Pompeo criticizes Obama: CAIRO — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a scathing rebuke of the Obama administration’s Mideast policies on Thursday, accusing the former president of "misguided" thinking that diminished America’s role in the region while harming its longtime friends and emboldening Iran. In a speech to the American University in Cairo, Pompeo unloaded on President Donald Trump’s predecessor, saying he was naive and timid when confronted with challenges posed by the revolts that convulsed the Middle East, including Egypt, beginning in 2011.
No more location data sales: AT&T says it will stop selling all location data from mobile phones to brokers following a report that companies are still selling that information to shadowy companies without customer knowledge. Last year, AT&T and other carriers pledged to stop providing location information to data brokers. But AT&T made an exception for useful services that, for instance, help customers with roadside assistance or fraud protection. Now the company says it will also end those sales in March.
Editor fired for altered image: SEATTLE — A Seattle TV station has fired an editor after airing video footage of President Donald Trump’s Oval Office address on immigration that appears to be altered. FOX affiliate Q13 broadcast video from the Tuesday night speech that showed a more orange-toned Trump with his tongue hanging out languidly from his mouth after making a statement. The video’s filtered colors look more saturated and the tongue appears doctored. Mynorthwest.com posted side-by-side videos showing the discrepancies.

Texto completo: With the conspicuous exception of President Trump and some of his supporters, Americans were appalled when it was revealed that Russian "troll farms" had launched a disinformation campaign on social media designed to influence the 2016 election. But online deception about elections is detestable even when it originates inside this country, as it apparently did in a 2017 special election for a U.S. Senate seat from Alabama.
The New York Times reported Monday that progressive Democrats opposed to Roy Moore, the odious Republican candidate in that race, created a Facebook page and Twitter feed purporting to represent Moore supporters opposed to the sale of alcoholic beverages.
The convoluted strategy behind the "Dry Alabama" campaign was to associate Moore with calls for a statewide ban on the sale of liquor in order to alienate moderate, pro-business Republicans and help Democratic candidate Doug Jones. (Jones, who says he had no idea that the deception was underway on his behalf, was narrowly elected.)
"Dry Alabama" was actually the second case of Russian-style disinformation in the Alabama campaign uncovered by the New York Times. In December it reported on an "experiment" in which a phony Facebook page was created to try to drain support for Moore from conservatives and a "false flag" operation was created to suggest that the Republican candidate was being followed on Twitter by Russian bots. Ironically, one of the participants in that project was Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, a cyber security firm that compiled a report on Russian disinformation for the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Morgan said that his intention was to understand the mechanics of disinformation tactics, not to affect the outcome of the election. But the New York Times quoted an internal report saying that the project sought to "enrage and energize Democrats."
Misleading voters is not just another campaign tactic. It's a corruption of democracy.
Jones, the supposed beneficiary of these efforts, sees things more clearly. After the first report of online disinformation, the senator said that he was outraged. He has called for investigations by the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department to see whether any laws were violated.
Even if they weren't, this sort of deception is entirely unacceptable, whether practiced by Republicans, Democrats or Russians. Candidates should follow Jones' lead in disavowing it.

Texto completo: Iranian authorities confirmed this week that a U.S. Navy veteran has been detained in Iran, making him the latest foreigner with ties to America to be imprisoned.
Bahram Qasemi, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, told the official Islamic Republic News Agency that Michael White, 46, has been imprisoned in the eastern city of Mashhad at the notorious Vakilabad Prison, which is known for its executions of drug traffickers, and that his case is still being reviewed.
The formal announcement on Wednesday came weeks after an activist who was imprisoned alongside White took to social media to reveal the veteran's arrest.

Ivar Farhadi, 30, said White, who is from San Diego, has been imprisoned since last summer. Farhadi said he was outside playing volleyball when he met White in prison in October.
"I was surprised to see an American in this prison," Farhadi said. "He was kept in a cell with around 20 people."
While in prison, the Persian-speaking Farhadi said he was able to speak with White with the help of another prisoner, who translated into English for him.
White told him that he had visited Iran three times to see his Iranian girlfriend. He also said that White told him he had been arrested at the international airport in Mashhad on the day he was supposed to go to Turkey with his girlfriend.
Farhadi said White was concerned his family thought he was missing, because he wasn't allowed to make a phone call. He also told Farhadi that he suffers from a tumor in his neck.
Farhadi last saw White before being released on bail in November. He decided to flee to Turkey after he was sentenced to six years for spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic.
In mid-December, after settling down in Turkey, Farhadi took to Twitter to get the message out about White.
"An American citizen by the name of Michael White is in prison in Vailabad general jail #4, section 6/1 in Mashhad, Iran. He is 45 from San Diego and an ex-American marine," he wrote in December, apparently using "marine" in a generic sense.
"He's been in prison since August 2018 in an anti-human condition and he has no access to phone and is not allowed to have a visitor. Also he has found a tumor in his body that he thinks might be cancerous."
A few weeks later, Farhadi got in touch with a journalist who writes for IranWire, an online publication put together by young Iranians inside and outside of Iran.
IranWire reported this week that White had been arrested.
White's mother said she found out only three weeks ago from State Department officials that her son was in prison in Iran, the New York Times reported. She did not respond to queries from the Los Angeles Times.
The State Department confirmed this week that it is aware of reports that a U.S. citizen is being held in Iran.
Qasemi, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Americans were notified about White's arrest soon after it happened via the American mission inside the Swiss Embassy in Tehran. The United States broke off formal diplomatic relations with Iran during the Iran hostage crisis in 1980, and Switzerland has represented U.S. interests in Tehran.
According to a nonprofit website dedicated to helping veterans, White served 13 years in the Navy, working in aviation maintenance administration. After retiring, White attended San Diego State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science.

Oceans hottest on record in 2018, warming faster than previously thought

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, its also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced Thursday. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," said paper co-author Zeke Hausfather, in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, who is a climate scientist with Carbon Brief.
He also said that while 2018 was the 4th-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters that records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.

More: Greenland's ice sheet melt has 'gone into overdrive' and is now 'off the charts'
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
“Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!” the paper's authors wrote.
The new analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top climate change computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told the New York Times that the new research was “a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together. ”
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who has crusaded for President Trump's impeachment, said on Wednesday that he would not join the pack of Democrats running for president in 2020 and would instead redouble his efforts to topple Mr. Trump before the election.
Mr. Steyer's decision came as a surprise even to some of his political confidants. He had made deliberate preparations in recent months to seek the White House, running television ads in the early primary states, recruiting potential staff members and even designating a campaign manager for a possible run.
But Mr. Steyer began informing aides early this week that he would not be a candidate after all, after concluding that he could have a greater political impact through his impeachment activism, several advisers to Mr. Steyer said. Mr. Steyer intends to spend at least $40 million on impeachment efforts in the coming year -- money that might otherwise have been directed toward a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
"Most people come to Iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president," Mr. Steyer said in prepared remarks, which were obtained by The New York Times. "But I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president."
Alluding to Mr. Trump's Oval Office address on Tuesday night, in which he demanded the construction of a border wall, Mr. Steyer said the president had "once again lied to the American people, repeatedly, for his own political skin." He described Mr. Trump as having already committed numerous offenses warranting his removal from office, and warned Democrats that shying away from an impeachment battle would serve to "enable" the president.
Mr. Steyer, 61, left himself some wiggle room to change his mind on 2020, saying in prepared remarks that he had decided against running "at this time." But his announcement ended -- at least for now -- the latest of several flirtations with seeking high office, which have also included abortive candidacies for the United States Senate and for governor of California. He considered running for president in 2016 before ultimately endorsing Hillary Clinton.
In some respects, the Democratic primary landscape appeared inviting for a candidate like Mr. Steyer, with his sterling credentials as a Trump antagonist and a virtually bottomless well of money to spend on advertising. He has been one of the Democratic Party's most prolific donors over the last few elections, eclipsed in 2018 only by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who is considering a presidential campaign of his own.
Anticipating a likely race, Mr. Steyer had settled on a close adviser, Heather Hargreaves, to serve as his eventual campaign manager. He had conducted research into his own political vulnerabilities, in anticipation of attacks from other Democrats in a rowdy primary, and had mapped out how to reorganize his advocacy groups to comply with the fund-raising regulations that apply to presidential candidates.
Mr. Steyer also recently retained a new senior adviser, Doug Rubin, who previously advised former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts on a possible 2020 run. Mr. Patrick announced last month that he had closed the door on a presidential candidacy.
Mr. Steyer and his advisers had conducted polling to test a campaign message focused on attacking corporate greed, confronting climate change -- and, of course, denouncing Mr. Trump.
Yet amid his preparations, there were warning signs for Mr. Steyer, too. As a candidate, he would have faced new levels of scrutiny of his business record: Mr. Steyer made his vast fortune as the founder of a hedge fund, and his portfolio of investments included considerable stakes in fossil fuel companies. As a wealthy white man, he could have been an awkward cultural match for a party increasingly defined by demands for racial and gender equality, and economic populism.
And Mr. Steyer's intention to use his personal fortune in fueling a presidential campaign would most likely have been divisive in a Democratic primary. His announcement in Iowa that he would not run comes days after the first major Democratic candidate to join the race, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, denounced self-funding candidates on a swing through the leadoff caucus state.
An adviser to Mr. Steyer, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with him, said that he had been unruffled by Ms. Warren's attacks on billionaire candidates. But, the adviser said, Mr. Steyer was impressed by Ms. Warren's rollout as a candidate and suggested that her announcement video channeled the very themes he had been planning to campaign on.
Mr. Steyer also disclosed to Vogue magazine in November that he and his wife of 32 years, Kat Taylor, were living separately.
He is the second prominent Democrat to make preparations for a 2020 campaign before abandoning them, after Mr. Patrick.
In stepping back from the presidential race, Mr. Steyer signaled he would further ramp up his impeachment drive, which has roiled Democratic politics over the last year, bringing him into direct conflict with elected party leaders and helping shove the idea of Mr. Trump's early removal into the mainstream of debate on the left.
Underwritten by Mr. Steyer's personal wealth, the impeachment campaign has bombarded television and computer screens around the country with ads demanding Mr. Trump's ouster, and staged pro-impeachment events around the country.
Mr. Steyer indicated on Wednesday that his pressure campaign would continue. One of his political committees, Need to Impeach, said it would aim a pressure campaign at House Democrats who lead committees relevant to impeachment, including Representatives Adam Schiff of California, who heads the House Intelligence Committee, and Jerrold Nadler of New York, who leads the House Judiciary Committee.
And Mr. Steyer, a longtime donor to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, called on her by name to "select a bipartisan group of lawmakers to start immediately" with a process to remove Mr. Trump from office.
"The longer they wait, the more they normalize Mr. Trump's unacceptable acts," Mr. Steyer said in his prepared speech. "And the more they enable him."
Democratic leaders remain wary of Mr. Steyer's impeachment message, and the institutional obstacles to removing Mr. Trump from office still appear insurmountable. Ejecting a president requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate, and Republicans hold 53 seats in the chamber.
Yet the idea of impeachment has moved steadily into the foreground of the Democratic imagination, despite the obvious practical impediments. When a high-profile freshman lawmaker, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, vowed last week in coarse language to impeach Mr. Trump, she drew little censure from party leaders and numerous influential voices on the left leapt to her defense.

In wall duel, Trump's favored dealmaking tactics fall short

Texto completo: President Trump has long said that keeping opponents off balance is the best way to win a negotiation. But nearly three weeks into a partial government shutdown, his usual playbook doesn't seem to be working.
In his fight for a section of border wall, the president has dispatched aides to negotiate with lawmakers only to undercut their offers. He has declared a "crisis" at the U.S.-Mexico border but abruptly dropped a talking point about an influx of terrorists after it was proved false. And he has vacillated between threatening to declare a national emergency and professing to prefer a negotiated deal with Democrats.
On Wednesday, a day after delivering a prime-time Oval Office address to add gravitas to his public appeal, Trump abruptly walked out of a private meeting with lawmakers at the White House.
A "total waste of time," Trump fumed on Twitter, lending credence to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer's accusations that the president is prone to "temper tantrums" when he doesn't get his way.
Trump's approach is a hallmark of a president who eschews strategic planning and preparation in favor of day-to-day tactical maneuvering and trusting his gut. But as he digs in against an emboldened Democratic opposition, Trump has found that his go-to arsenal of bluster, falsehoods, threats and theatrics has laid bare his shortcomings as a negotiator - preventing him from finding a way out of what may be the biggest political crisis of his presidency.
"Doesn't the president do everything ad hoc? He's a gut politician," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates lower immigration levels. "He's gotten out of boxes before, but this one is a zero-sum game. There are obvious resolutions on policy, but this is more of a political fight. Trump needs to say he got a win."
Yet what a win looks like, and how he intends to get there, remain cloudy.
Though Trump plans to visit a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Tex., on Thursday, he revealed his antipathy about the photo op, confiding to television news correspondents in a private lunch this week that he was going only because aides insisted he do so, according to the New York Times.
With a lack of clarity from the White House, anxious Republicans say they are unsure what Trump would accept to end the standoff, while skeptical Democrats express doubt that the president can be trusted to stick with any deal he makes.
"Democrats keep saying, 'We don't trust it until Trump will sign it,' " Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters Wednesday about the negotiations on Capitol Hill. "That's not an unreasonable request. . . . We won't know until we put something in front of him."
Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) pointed to a round of immigration negotiations with the White House a year ago. At more than one point, Democrats thought they had a deal with Trump to provide some wall funding in exchange for giving legal status to some undocumented immigrants - only to have him reject it in public.
"It has been frustrating," Durbin said. "A year ago, we went through this on immigration reform. It did not end well."
Meantime, public pressure is mounting on the White House.
Some moderate rank-and-file Republicans have signaled they would support reopening the government. A union representing Customs and Border Protection officers has sued the administration on behalf of federal workers who have not been paid. And news reports of airport delays, potential disruptions to food stamp assistance and a freeze on some government travel have prompted the administration to patch together temporary solutions.
Against that backdrop, Trump told reporters Wednesday that many of the 800,000 furloughed federal workers "are on my side." In the end, he said, they would be paid and are "going to be happy."
But in a sign that he has grown less confident of his standing, Trump insisted: "This is not a fight I wanted." It was a remarkable assertion from a president who declared in a televised Oval Office meeting with Democratic leaders in mid-December that he would be "proud" to shut down the government for border security and would not blame them for it.
White House allies professed confusion over the president's tactics. Trump aides initially signaled he would support a continuing resolution from Congress to fund the government through early February, but the president reversed course in the face of intense criticism from conservative talk show hosts and border hawks.
Since forcing a partial shutdown, the president has argued that a wall is necessary to block illegal drugs, even though the majority of contraband is smuggled through official U.S. ports of entry. He has said 4,000 terrorists were apprehended at the southern border, only to be challenged and proved wrong by reporters, including some from Fox News.
Trump has shifted his description of the wall to suggest the barrier will be made of steel slats to counter Democratic criticism of an "immoral" concrete behemoth and to comply with wishes from Border Patrol agents who prefer to be able to see activity across the border.
And he has simultaneously insisted that his hard-line immigration policies are working even while warning of a "crisis" of criminals and drugs "pouring into our country."
"It's fair to say that there's been a variety of different asks and demands and statements by the administration, some of which have not always been accurate and some of which have been poorly received," said David Inserra, a national security analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, which supports more restrictive immigration laws.
"The one place where you'll find consistency has been their desire to say, 'We want to stop illegal immigration,' " he added. "How do we stop it? Those arguments have been many and varied. To be fair, there are many arguments, but they seem to be searching for one to get some advantage in the political battle."
In recent days, the White House has even shifted its messaging from focusing on national security concerns at the border to appealing to public empathy by describing the situation as a "humanitarian" emergency. A record number of migrant families with children, mostly from Central America, have been apprehended at the border over the past year, a problem that immigration advocates said has been exacerbated by the administration's policies.
The Trump administration also has added new demands on top of the wall funding, including changes to immigration laws that would allow federal authorities to detain families for longer periods and speed up deportations by rolling back some due-process laws. These are moves that Democrats, and some Republicans, oppose.
For Republicans who have tried to stick with the mercurial president, the shifting goal posts have been frustrating. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he will not allow a vote on any bill to reopen the government unless he receives assurances from the White House that Trump supports it.
"It's always difficult," said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), "when the person you're negotiating with is someone who changes their mind."

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it encourages a glass of red wine every now and then.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: Dozens of Long Islanders turned out Tuesday to question Suffolk police officials about what role a school resource officer played in the deportation of a Huntington High School student.
The crowd of more than 50 people at the monthly community meeting at the Second Precinct in Huntingtonaired concerns about the handling of the student. The deportation came to light in a New York Times/ProPublica story The New York Times Magazine posted online in late December.
The student was arrested in June 2017 by federal immigration officials after he was questioned by the school resource officer and the principal about his alleged gang activities, according to the account. Identified only as "Alex," the boy was sent back to his native Honduras, the story said.
The police department "is satisfied that the proper procedures were followed," a public information officer said in an email. The Huntington School District is reviewing its relationship with the department.
At the community meeting, many said they believed the process had identified the student as a gang member without thoroughly investigating him.
"We feel he was innocent and denied due process," said Cheryl Lynn Blum, of Huntington Station.
The handling of the student has created a rift between the police and the school, many in the room said.
"The students feel [the officer] has ratted out their friend," said Sandy Saginaw of Huntington. "There needs to be some healing."
The school resource officer, Andrew Fiorillo, is one of five such officers in the Second Precinct, said Insp. Bill Scrima, the precinct's commanding officer.
Fiorillo has been in the schools for about 14 years and is well-liked and respected by students and teachers, Scrima said.
"Kids come up to him, hug him," Scrima said. "That said, he has a job to do."
The school resource officer is still on the job but is no longer at Huntington High, he said.
"If we're welcome, we go; if we're not, we don't, " Scrima said.
Several residents asked Scrima to describe the process for identifying a student as a gang member and the level of communication between the police department and federal immigration officials.
A student, he said, is identified as a suspected gang member after evidence is collected that establishes possible ties between the student and a gang. The evidence could include writings, drawings or wearing the colors of a gang, as well as statements from students or school staff members, he said.
The student's name is entered into a police database, Scrima said. The student's parents may be notified if officials think they can play a role in turning around their child, he said.
Matt Harris of Huntington Station took issue with how the magazine account painted Huntington High School.
"This article made the school look like a really awful, gang-infested place," he said. "That's ridiculous."
The story was written by a reporter with the nonprofit news organization ProPublica, which did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Last week, in a statement, ProPublica president Richard Tofel said, "With respect to the story, the school district has not indicated that there are any inaccuracies at all, and we are aware of none."
At a Huntington school board meeting Monday night, hundreds showed up to talk about the magazine account.
Huntington High Principal Brenden Cusack described the account as a misrepresentation of him and the school, saying, "The story as published is not the whole story."

Texto completo: As someone who takes pride in being something of an ice cream connoisseur, I’m quite familiar with the “flavor of the week.” I’ve also watched enough ESPN to know every sport from bowling to volleyball selects a “player of the week.”
But New Hampshire “Fugitive of the Week?”
That was news to me — until a media release from the U.S. Marshals Service’s office in Concord showed up in my inbox announcing an arrest in Claremont last week.
James Perry — wanted on an outstanding warrant for parole violations since October — had recently been named the U.S. Marshals’ Fugitive of the Week. After Perry’s mug shot was distributed to print, broadcast and online media across New Hampshire in mid-December, the federal agency that specializes in fugitive-hunting received multiple tips from the public that pointed to his whereabouts.
Last Thursday, Perry, 30, was “located and arrested without incident” at a Claremont apartment, according to U.S. Marshals. Perry’s capture got the Fugitive of the Week program “off to a great start” in 2019, the agency crowed.
That’s one way to look at it.
The overriding objective of law enforcement, after all, is to get bad guys off the street. The hype surrounding Fugitive of the Week also plays into the hands of media who know that crime news can boost ratings, improve sales and increase clicks.
It’s a win-win all around.
So what’s the problem?
I looked up the last 10 fugitives that New Hampshire’s U.S. Marshals office chose to highlight. Six, including Perry, were white. The remaining four were people of color. A small sample, but in a state where minorities make up less than 7 percent of the population, it does make me wonder about racial profiling.
Jeffrey White, the U.S. Marshals supervisory deputy in New Hampshire who oversees the program, told me that the color of a fugitive’s skin was irrelevant. When he and others in the Marshals office are deciding on whom to feature each week, “race isn’t even considered,” White said. “We just know them all as fugitives.”
I’ll take him at his word.
Still, when a federal law enforcement agency is partnering with local media to round up alleged fugitives, why does it seem like the makings of bad reality TV?
Adding to the theatrics: After an arrest is made, the U.S. Marshals Service stamps “Captured” across the alleged fugitive’s mug shot on its website.
In Vermont, however, U.S. Marshals take a different approach to fugitive-hunting.
“We don’t necessarily publicize that we’re looking for someone,” Deputy U.S. Marshal Mike Barron told me. “That’s not to say publicity is wrong. We’d just rather do our thing more quietly.”
Makes sense to me, particularly, when it’s unclear whether flashing a bunch of mug shots on media websites for the public to gawk at does more harm than good.
A front-page story in The New York Times on Sunday questioned the longstanding police practice of showing mug shots to crime victims and eyewitnesses to identify culprits. It can “increase the likelihood of ensnaring an innocent person,” the Times wrote. “The method has few safeguards to protect against a false identification and can lead police to focus on the wrong person from the outset of an investigation.”
Anonymous tips, which often come by phone or text message, are carefully evaluated before the U.S. Marshals act on them, White said. Since Fugitive of the Week debuted in 2007 (the Valley News doesn’t participate, which is my lame excuse for just finding out about the program), the Marshals Service has not had a problem with false tips, White said.
In the beginning, White was skeptical that weekly publicity blitzes to drum up tipsters would result in promising leads. “I thought it was going to be a waste of time, but the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.
In 2018, “cooperation with media partners and tipsters” led to 42 fugitive arrests in New Hampshire, the U.S. Marshals Service reported.
I found it interesting that 14 of the 42 people were on the lam for drug-related crimes — more than any other type of offense. If nothing else, it speaks to the revolving-door nature of the state’s criminal justice system for people battling substance abuse.
Perry seems to be an example. He has a lengthy criminal record dating back to his teenage years, but hadn’t spent much time behind bars until he pleaded guilty to robbing a Claremont convenience store in 2013.
Perry gave the store clerk a note indicating that he had a gun when he actually didn’t. He made off with $270 in cash that he used to buy drugs. On the day that he was sentenced to two to five years in state prison, Perry told the judge about his addiction to heroin and cocaine.
I don’t know enough about Perry — or any other Fugitive of the Week — to say whether he belongs back in prison. But I don’t need a tipster to figure out that locking up addicted people without treating their substance abuse problems is a prescription for failure.
And as a society, maybe we could ask ourselves if time spent gawking at mug shots could be better spent advocating for addicts.

Do ex-presidents back Trump wall? They say no

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump's recent claim that his predecessors endorsed his idea of a wall at the Mexican border got no support from the ex-presidents' club.
Trump stated in a Rose Garden news conference Friday: "This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me. And they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it."
THE FACTS: The four living ex-presidents do not back him up on this claim.
■ “I have not discussed the border wall with President Trump, and do not support him on the issue," said Jimmy Carter.
■ “The answer is no," said Angel Urena, speaking for Bill Clinton. "In fact, they've not talked since the inauguration."
■ George W. Bush has not discussed the wall with Trump, said spokesman Freddy Ford.
■ Barack Obama's office did not respond except to send along some of his past comments on the subject, such as this one from May 2016: "Suggesting that we can build an endless wall along our borders, and blame our challenges on immigrants — that doesn't just run counter to our history as the world's melting pot; it contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe."
Since Trump's inauguration, his only interaction with Obama was a quick exchange at former president George H.W. Bush's funeral.
Asked Tuesday about Trump's claim of support for the wall from his predecessors, Vice President Mike Pence told NBC's "Today" show, "I know the president has said that was his impression from previous presidents."
Pence added: "I've seen clips of previous presidents talking about the importance of border security and the importance of addressing illegal immigration.'
Associated Press
House Democrats' bill would require background checks
WASHINGTON — House Democrats, seeking a politically charged debate on gun control, unveiled legislation Tuesday to expand background checks to nearly all firearms purchases, a move timed to mark the eighth anniversary of the mass shooting in Arizona that nearly killed former Representative Gabrielle Giffords.
By introducing the measure less than one week after taking control of the House, Democrats are signaling that it is a top priority. A vote could come within the first 100 days of the new Congress.
The bill, which will almost certainly pass the House but face a steep climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, would require background checks on the purchases of nearly all firearms, including those sold at gun shows and over the Internet. There would be limited exception.
Polls have shown that most Americans — by some estimates, 90 percent — support universal background checks for all gun purchases. Many Democrats, including Representative Lucy McBath, a freshman from Georgia whose son was shot and killed at a Florida gas station, were elected last year after promising to address gun safety.
“Today we take a decisive step to help save lives right away," said Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California, the bill's chief sponsor.
By limiting the bill to background checks — and keeping out other provisions such as a ban on assault rifles or high-capacity magazines — gun safety advocates hope to pressure Republicans on a policy that has broad public support. In the Senate, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, will have to decide whether to bring up the bill. In the House, Republicans will be forced to vote on it.
But by narrowing the bill so dramatically, Democrats may also limit its utility. Suspects in many recent high-profile mass shootings had passed background checks when purchasing their weapons.
Even so, gun law changes rarely make it through Congress. The measure is similar to one written by Senators Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, in 2012. That bill that fell to a bipartisan filibuster in 2013 in a Senate controlled by Democrats.
Then as now, the National Rifle Association opposed the measure.
New York Times
Supreme Court lets stand subpoena linked to Mueller
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday left in place a lower court order requiring an unnamed foreign-owned corporation to comply with a subpoena said to be part of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The court dissolved a temporary stay that had been put in place by Chief Justice John Roberts.
The entity that is the subject of the cloaked legal battle — known in court papers simply as a "Corporation" from "Country A" — is a foreign financial institution that was issued a subpoena by a grand jury hearing evidence in the special counsel investigation, according to two people familiar with the case.
It is thought to be the first time that an aspect of Mueller's wide-ranging probe into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign has reached the Supreme Court.

2019 Wall Street outlook? You might not want to know

Texto completo: In good times and bad, Wall Street has to have a story — a clear, concise view of the economy and markets and how you, our valued client, can make money by trading with us.
As we limp into 2019, about the most upbeat line the pros can spin is that, hey, a recession probably won't hit until next year. Otherwise, most agree that the growth rate for the US economy and corporate earnings will weaken, financial markets will continue to be volatile, and investment profits will be much harder to find.
Just how much harder?
Bloomberg reporters sifted through dozens of Wall Street research notes and provided a Reader's Digest version of the key takeaways.
Morgan Stanley has one of the gloomier outlooks:
“We think the bear market is mostly complete for emerging markets, has further to go in U.S. credit and is about to begin for the dollar. We remain neutral equities, underweight credit, neutral government bonds and overweight cash."
Translation for the average investor: Lay low, and put money in safe certificates of deposit or under your mattress.
State Street Global Advisors tries to find a silver lining:
“Slower global economic growth, higher volatility, less accommodative monetary policies and falling earnings likely mean lower returns. However, the risk of a recession, particularly in the U.S., remains quite low."
Its advice: Some solid companies might get cheap enough to make them a reasonable bargain. Maybe.
So as you open up your year-end retirement plan statement — if you have the stomach to look — it's reasonable to wonder how painful 2019 will be. That's impossible to know right now. There are too many economic and political uncertainties out there to confidently assess whether we'll get a “soft landing" — a gradual slowdown but no recession — or a more damaging contraction.
Here's a subjective and incomplete list of questions (all interrelated) that we need more clarity on:
■ Will consumer confidence hold up? The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell slightly in December, but it remains at a level not seen since just before the 2001 dot-com recession. Because consumer spending accounts for about three-quarters of the US economy, a sharp deterioration in confidence would spell trouble. But some decline should be expected, given the stock market sell-off and the prospects for slower growth.
■ How cold will the housing market get? In Boston, as in many other markets around the country, home prices are rising, but at a slower pace than in the first half of 2018. Inventories remain tight. If you start getting a lot more price-drop alerts from Zillow, be prepared to hunker down. There is a bright spot: Mortgage rates have fallen to an eight-month low.
■ Can the United States and China reach a trade deal? The tariff war has spooked investors and hurt US farmers and companies. A successful resolution would provide a big boost to the market. On Monday, word that Chinese and American negotiators were talking again was enough to help stocks move higher. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 23,531, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.3 percent.
■ Will Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of President Trump reveal any impeachable offenses? David Leonhardt of The New York Times wrote a long Sunday opinion piece arguing that Trump is unfit for office. But it seems unlikely that Congress would move against the president if Mueller's probe finds no significant wrongdoing. But if Mueller finds a smoking gun, and the Democrats push to remove the president from office, we could find ourselves in a destablizing constitutional crisis.
■ Will rising wages lead to a reduction in job creation? The blowout December payroll report on Friday (312,000 new private sector jobs) was accompanied by a 3.2 percent gain in average hourly wages over last year. That was the biggest jump in wages since the financial crisis, and good news for workers, who have not fared nearly as well as investors during the long expansion. But if wages start climbing too quickly, the Federal Reserve may get antsy and raise interest rates again, a move that tends to hurt stocks.
■ And, speaking of the Fed and interest rates, can it successfully pursue its primary mission — keeping inflation low and employment high — without inadvertently pushing the economy into a recession? It's a difficult tightrope to walk, but Fed chairman Jerome Powell, after sending conflicting signals, last week made his position clear: While the central bank expects to raise its benchmark federal funds rate twice this year, it will be flexible, acting only if the data warrant tighter credit, not following a predetermined path to bringing rates back to more normal levels.
But there is only so much reassurance the Fed can offer. It has erred in the past — most recently by keeping rates too low for too long, leading to the housing bubble — and Powell is new and hasn't won the trust of investors, as his most immediate predecessors did.
And, most important, it's not the Fed's job to make sure the markets keep going up. Ben Bernanke, who served as Fed chairman from 2006 to 2014, told a conference over the weekend that, in the grand scheme of things, the current correction isn't so catastrophic as to require special intervention.
Looking back at the financial crisis of 2008-2009, he said that “what we've seen in the last year, I hate to tell any investors here, this is not all that huge."

CITY &amp; STATE; Schiff presses probe of Russia skyscraper deal; Burbank congressman raises concerns that Mueller could ignore Trump's pursuit of private business deals.

Texto completo: Rep. Adam B. Schiff expressed concern Monday that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III might decline to look into President Trump's private business dealings as he investigates Russia's interference in America's 2016 election.
As a result, the Burbank congressman said, it could be up to Democrats who took control of the House last week to expose the full scope of alleged wrongdoing by Trump and his allies, Schiff told the Los Angeles Times editorial board.
Schiff, a Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, cited the revelation by Michael Cohen, the president's former personal lawyer, that Trump was actively pursuing a deal to build a skyscraper in Moscow during the 2016 campaign even while denying doing business with Russia.

"Now, the Russians knew this was happening, which makes it very compromising, because the Russians could expose it," Schiff said.
"Anyone who engaged in anything like that, anything remotely like that, would never get a security clearance, but this is the president of the United States," he added. "If the financial entanglement goes beyond that, and includes money laundering and criminal activity that the Russians could expose at a time and place of their choosing, that's compromising."
Schiff said he suspects that "Mueller may not be looking at this, which concerns me, because it means that up until now no one has looked at this."
Schiff cited a New York Times story last April that Trump was ready to fire Mueller after an erroneous report that the special counsel had subpoenaed Deutsche Bank records on his real estate business. The White House, he said, might be forcing Mueller to steer clear of his private finances.
"I don't know whether the Justice Department is maintaining that red line that the president decided to draw," he said. "If they are, then we'll be the only people, the only investigation of that thus far, our committee and any other committee in Congress that looks at that issue."
Mueller's function is to see who broke the law and deserves to go to jail, not to tell the country what happened, Schiff said.
Schiff also signaled that if Mueller releases a report implicating Trump in criminal wrongdoing, House Democratic leaders were not inclined to impeach Trump if it appears the Republicans who control the Senate will refuse to convict him and remove him from office.
In his former job as a federal prosecutor, he said, "it was not our tradition or habit or policy to indict people that we did not believe we could prove guilty in trial and convict merely to put them through the process of a trial or to expose wrongdoing if we couldn't persuade a jury beyond a reasonable doubt."
"I think the same is true in impeachment -- that it's a tremendously wrenching thing to put a country through, and it obviously has a deeply disruptive impact on the running of the government ... and there are ordinary mechanisms to remove a president at the ballot box, and so to depart from that, you need a powerful reason, and I don't think you undertake that process unless you have some expectation that it's going to be successful."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump vowed a "prudent" withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, embracing a new, more cautious timeline on Monday while appearing to deny that he had ever ordered an immediate troop departure in the first place.
"We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!" Trump said in a morning tweet. That was "no different from my original statements," he said, accusing the news media of inaccurately reporting "my intentions on Syria."
Last month, Trump declared the Islamic State group defeated in Syria and said troops would be "coming back now." Since then, senior officials have issued a series of statements that have cast doubt on his promise of a quick departure.
The president's endorsement of a flexible departure, conditioned on the still-to-come defeat of the Islamic State, was the latest indication of his administration's zigzagging foreign policy, in which decisions are often made by dramatic presidential tweets and followed by more circumspect policies reflecting top advisers' views.
The initial plan for a quick withdrawal, which would require turning over the U.S.-supported effort against remaining militants to NATO ally Turkey, was met with dismay among officials and lawmakers who feared the Islamic State could return in force. A day after Trump's announcement, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest.
Trump's new remarks appeared to endorse a revised proposal, floated by National Security Adviser John Bolton a day earlier, that would allow U.S. troops and their local allies to extinguish a small but stubborn militant force before they depart. It would also require Turkey to refrain from attacking Syrian Kurdish troops who are the chief U.S. partner on the ground.
The evolving plans came as Bolton traveled Monday to Ankara, Turkey's capital, for talks with Turkish officials on the U.S. withdrawal, including protection of the American-allied Syrian Democratic Forces, which Turkey has vowed to expel from northeast Syria.
Officials across the government have scrambled in recent days to keep up with shifting statements from administration leaders, even as they continued to make plans for a near-term military exit that they cautioned could squander the fruits of a four-year military effort. There are more than 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria.
While Trump initially demanded a 30-day departure, officials said the administration later settled on an exit within 120 days to give the military more time to break down bases and safely remove equipment and personnel. The latest comments from Trump and Bolton intensified uncertainty about what would occur.
Trump's pullout plan fueled concerns among allied nations, including France and Britain, who have sent their own troops to Syria. It also drew criticism from his own party, including from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who on Sunday said Trump had "made a mistake" with his initial pronouncement but was now "slowing down."
On Monday, the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee accused Trump of "changing course like a drunken sailor."
"It shows that our president literally doesn't know what he is doing. He is making it up as he goes," Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., told CNN. "The way he is going about it is disastrous."
But Trump and his top advisers were defiant Monday as they denied that their Syria plans had changed.
"The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria," Trump said in the same tweet, referring to articles on Sunday from numerous publications, including the Times and The Washington Post, that noted the shifting accounts of the military exit. "No different from my original statements."

Liberal Media Scream: ‘Prestige press’ pro-Trump, ‘easier coverage than he deserves’

Texto completo: This week’s Liberal Media Scream features a view about the media’s Trump bias that even the former editor of the New York Times would mock.

It comes from Atlantic writer David Frum who said, in an apparent reference to the media biggies President Trump calls “fake news,” that the “prestige media” lets the president off the hook too often.

Frum, on CNN’s Reliable Sources Sunday, said that “relative to the truth, the prestige press in this country has a pro-Trump bias. Relative to the truth, Trump gets easier coverage than he deserves.”

And he said pro-Trump commentators should be working for the Home Shopping Network.

He was reacting to the observation, in an upcoming book by former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson, that the news pages the Times and the Washington Post are “unmistakably anti-Trump.”

Frum on the January 6 Reliable Sources:

“Relative to the truth, the prestige press in this country has a pro-Trump bias. Relative to the truth, Trump gets easier coverage than he deserves. The surest way onto the op-ed page of a prestigious paper is to come up with some angle to explain why something the president has done is less crazy or dangerous than it seems. Networks, like this one, give a lot of airtime to people who normally would be working for the Home Shopping Network, who wouldn’t be on at all.”

Media Research Center Vice President of Research Brent Baker explains our weekly pick: “What planet is Frum living on? You can argue that Trump is a terrible president who deserves negative coverage, but to contend the ‘prestige press’ has a bias in favor of Trump because they occasionally allow someone to defend him? That’s just nuts. By any measure, Trump is on the receiving end of the most hostile press of any president in the past century.”

Rating: Five out of five screams.

Gun deaths soar to new all-time high

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Two of the five worst mass shootings in recent U.S. history occurred in 2017, including in Las Vegas where a gunman barricaded in a high-rise hotel slaughtered 58 people at a music concert below. Mass killings kept happening last year: at a high school in Parkland, Florida; another school in Santa Fe, Texas; a synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Then, of course, there was the daily toll of less-publicized shootings and self-inflicted fatalities.
Even with Democrats taking power in the House on Thursday, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream, particularly given the power of the national gun lobby and continued Republican control of the Senate and White House.
The good news is that after the Parkland shooting, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns, and a license to buy handguns. The restrictions go further than federal background checks. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat. It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3.4 per 100,000.
Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchasing guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards buying firearms and ammo.
Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt "red flag" laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person's firearm for a limited period of time until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks.

Texto completo: The search for love is back on in "The Bachelor," and feel that high school nostalgia during "Friday Night Lights."
What's on TV
THE BACHELOR 8 p.m. on ABC. Colton Underwood, the former NFL football player and Season 14 "Bachelorette" contestant, returns to reality TV once more to try to find love. During the 23rd-season premiere of this show, which has captivated many and caused books to be written about its scope and power, Colton meets the 30 contenders after his heart. They include Miss Alabama 2018 and one contestant who brings, and momentarily leaves behind, her 10-year-old pet Pomeranian.
COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 8 p.m. on ESPN. Alabama, with a 14-0 record, takes on Clemson, also 14-0, for the national title. This is the fourth year these teams are meeting in the College Football Playoff, and the third time in those four years that the two go head-to-head for the championship.
AMERICA'S GOT TALENT: THE CHAMPIONS 8 p.m. on NBC. The judges Simon Cowell, Mel B, Heidi Klum and Howie Mandel return, and the new host, Terry Crews, arrives, in this series premiere. The show features the most notable contestants and acts from past seasons and other iterations of "America's Got Talent," bringing them together to compete for the title of world champion. Fifty acts will return to the stage, including the 2009 runner-up Susan Boyle; the knife-throwing act Deadly Games, a 2016 semifinalist; and the ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer, the 2017 winner.
What's Streaming
LOVE ACTUALLY (2003) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Hulu and Vudu. Although Christmas is over, it's hard to wean yourself from holiday movies. Now that Valentine's Day is approaching, a Christmas-themed film about love might help you get ready for February's celebration. With a star-studded cast -- Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and Keira Knightley, among others -- the film follows several intertwining love stories, including that of a prime minister who falls for a young staffer, and one about a marriage on the brink and plagued by infidelity. Despite a few questionable subplots involving a young woman and a much older man in a position of power, which prompted the critic A. O. Scott to label the movie's portrayal of love "shallow and dishonest" in The New York Times, the feature remains a cult classic and even received an unorthodox 15-minute sequel nearly 15 years later.
FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (2004) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Hulu and Vudu. In this film, based on H. G. Bissinger's 1990 nonfiction book, the director Peter Berg brings the small town of Odessa, Tex., where football reigns, to the screen. Here, the game takes precedence over everything, rivaling religion. Inspired by the Permian High Panthers' 1988 season, the movie offers glimpses into the personal lives of the boys tasked with upholding their town's honor, like the star quarterback, Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), who is the victim of an abusive father (Tim McGraw). The players, as well as their coach (Billy Bob Thornton), must learn to navigate the pressures of being hometown heroes. Berg went on to create a television series of the same title, writing and directing its pilot episode.

Likability matters in elections

Texto completo: In the landmark obscenity case Jacobellis v. Ohio , Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously refused to define which level of "hard-core pornography" passed the point of constitutional protection.

"I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so," Stewart wrote. "But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that."

Likability mirrors obscenity in this sense. It doesn't manifest itself in the same way across candidates, but you know it when you see it.

Hillary Clinton was not likable. It cost her the 2008 presidential primary, where she lost to one of the most annoyingly likable and charming candidates in modern American political history.

Elizabeth Warren is not likable. Her political passion looks earnest, especially based on her personal background and foray into public life, but from her "goin' get her a beer" and hackneyed selfie videos, every stunt the Massachusetts senator and presidential hopeful pulls feels like a came straight of a can, packaged by a focus group.

Employing a lazy feminist trope, Annie Linskey and David Weigel at the Washington Post, have chalked up the anti-Warren sentiment to sexism.

"But even as Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was elected House speaker on Wednesday, the women looking at White House campaigns continue to shoulder gendered criticism and demands not placed on their male counterparts," the pair write. "To be strong but not too tough; to be assertive without being pushy, lest voters turn away for reasons that they may not acknowledge are sexist but that researchers say are."

Needless to say, this is hogwash for two main reasons.

First off, likability has plagued male politicians as long as America has existed. Aaron Burr found himself increasingly alienated almost solely due to his perceived opportunism and lack of likability. Most of the 2016 Republican primary centered around personality rather than policy.

Just as President Obama's likability covered for his unique lack of experience, Ted Cruz's lack of likability possibly cost him the 2016 presidential primary. In a piece titled "Anyone but Ted Cruz," New York Times columnist Frank Bruni explicitly cited the fact that on a personal level colleagues "dislike him" as a boon against his presidential candidacy. And so long as politics rely on representatives to vote on the behalf of the people, personal charisma, apparent integrity, and likability will always play a key role in elections.

Second, if anti-Warren animus could be solely attributed to sexism, then how could you possibly explain the number of Democratic women whose celebrity has exploded overnight?

Take Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., whose resume is arguably even more "tough," "pushy," and opportunistic than Warren's. Klobuchar cut her teeth in corporate law and has spent over a decade in the Senate. She's just as white as Warren and doesn't hold back on the Senate Judiciary Committee. But she has the "it" factor. She's likable. She might be the only Democrat who improved her political capital during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.

And how about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.? She may tout idiotic and catastrophic economic policies, but she's also likable. Likability doesn't manifest itself the same way in different people. It's why, when Ocasio-Cortez puts out an Instagram live video, she seems like the kind of millennial you might actually want to brunch with. When Warren does it, you can't help but cringe.

You can't define or quantify it, or develop a one-size-fits all model, or pull it out of thin air. But you know likability when you see it. Warren ain't it, and it isn't because she's a woman.

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA — In many ways, what the Bears are about to find out about quarterback Mitchell Trubisky in the playoffs is what the Eagles are longing to find out about their franchise quarterback, Carson Wentz.
The Eagles traded up to draft Wentz second overall in the 2016 draft, one year before the Bears traded up to draft Trubisky.
Trubisky will make his playoff debut Sunday. Wentz is injured heading into the postseason for the second straight season. He has never thrown a pass in a playoff game.
All the talk is about Eagles quarterback Nick Foles' seemingly superhuman feats as a backup leading another playoff run, as well as Trubisky's rise. But really, it should have been about two franchise quarterbacks facing off against each other early in their careers.
It's not like Trubisky has lit up the stat sheet in his second season, although he had a quarterback rating of at least 120.0 in four different games, the most by any Bears quarterback in a single season.
He has 3,223 yards passing and 24 touchdowns, but 12 interceptions, this season. Still, it's an improvement over his rookie campaign in which he threw for 2,193 yards in 12 games with seven TDs and seven interceptions.
Trubisky has also shown he can run the ball, with 421 yards, fifth among QBs this season.
Bears coach Matt Nagy, the former University of Delaware quarterback and Andy Reid protege both with the Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, is just as anxious to find out about Trubisky in the playoffs as everybody else.
"My approach coming into this year was just for him to know that it's going to take a little time," Nagy said. "We're going to learn together. I'm going to learn how he plays, and he'll learn how I coach."
As the Chicago Sun Times writes, the playoffs are when a quarterback's legacy is established. The Bears have the opportunity to find out about Trubisky. The Eagles are still waiting to find out about Wentz.
Rapid fire Brothers in arms could be literal as Eagles defensive end Chris Long could end up trying to get past his brother, Bears' right guard Kyle, to sack Trubisky. Kyle Long told the NFL Network that "on Sunday, we're not related." Then he was asked what kind of communication he'll have on the field with Chris: "No good communication ... He's on the other team, so I gotta figure out a way to beat him."
There have been plenty of comparisons of Eagles running back Darren Sproles and the Bears' Tarik Cohen, mainly because both are undersized at 5-foot-6 and both are seen as receivers first. Cohen led the Bears in receptions with 71 and was second in receiving yards with 725. Malcolm Jenkins, who respects and admires Cohen, said no one compares to Sproles.
But Cohen, in his second season, has many of the attributes of Sproles, who's 35 years old. The New York Times describes Cohen as "the Bears' handoff-taking, punt-returning, ball-catching, pass-throwing, mismatch-creating, gasp-inducing, highlight-monopolizing cyborg." One can say the same about Sproles.
Remember tight end Trey Burton, the famous thrower of the 1-yard TD pass to Foles in the Super Bowl, forever known in Eagles' lore as the "Philly Special?" Now, he's an integral part of the Bears' offense. Burton reflects fondly on his time with the Eagles, as NBC Sports Chicago details.
Around the NFC East Cowboys
When the Cowboys made the trade for Amari Cooper in late October, they were thinking more about the future than getting into the playoffs this season. After all, they were 3-5 at the time, and as Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones put it, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: "We were thinking: We're already behind the 8-ball, long shot to get back in it. This is really about long term. But we got back in it. And he helped us get in it."
Speaking of Cooper, he hasn't done much since torching the Eagles for 10 catches for 217 yards and three TDs on Dec. 9. In the three games since, Cooper has 13 catches for 83 yards. So ESPN.com wonders which Cooper will show up in the playoff game against the Seahawks.
The Cowboys and Seahawks have an interesting history. The Seattle Times breaks down the 5 best games between the two teams. That includes the 2006 playoff game that featured Cowboys' rookie QB Tony Romo, whose claim to fame that game was the botched hold for the potential game-winning field goal.
Giants
The offseason intrigue for the Giants began immediately when general manager Dave Gettleman didn't commit to Eli Manning's return for the 2019 season, and Manning himself didn't commit to it either in his radio show on New York's WFAN. "I don't know if it's leaning one way or the other right now," Manning said on the radio show. "I think this is kind of the time to reflect and figure out what's the best thing going forward."
Washington
How do you fix the Redskins? The Washington Post counts the ways with the team's offseason needs. That could include quarterback with Alex Smith's uncertain status following a devastating broken leg. And it could possibly include releasing cornerback Josh Norman.

Texto completo: ARTS & LEISURE
An article on Page 1 about the artists Gillie and Marc Schattner, using information from the artists and the MetroTech BID, misidentifies the organization that secured "The Last Three" sculpture in Brooklyn's MetroTech Commons. While MetroTech Commons is a privately operated space within the MetroTech BID, the BID did not secure the work. The error is repeated in a picture caption. The article also misstates Jennifer Lantzas's position with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. She is its deputy director of public art, not its public arts coordinator.
TRAVEL
An article on Page 1 about Jada Yuan's experiences traveling the world for The New York Times misstates the surname of a woman who was murdered in Washington last year. She was Wendy Martinez, not Marina. The article also misidentifies a farmer in Puerto Rico who told Ms. Yuan and a friend about a party. He is Elmer Sánchez, not Rafael.
Because of an editing error, an article on Dec. 23 about the Dead Sea misstated the amount of money in dollars that the Israeli tourism ministry recently spent on improvements at the Ein Bokek resort area. It was $135 million, not $13 million.
REAL ESTATE
A photograph with the cover story last Sunday, about Manhattan's housing market in 2018, was published in error. The picture showed 21 West End Avenue, not One West End Avenue, where several notable sales occurred.
THE MAGAZINE
An article on Dec. 16 about a patient who had a rare autoimmune disorder misstated the location of a Toronto hospital. While North York General Hospital is in Toronto, it is not in the downtown section of the city.

Education Dept. looks into native students' complaints

Texto completo: The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights will investigate allegations that a public school system in Montana discriminated against Native American students, according to a letter sent by the department to attorneys representing the students.
The students, from the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, filed a complaint with the federal government in June 2017 alleging the Wolf Point School District "deprives them of basic rights to which they are entitled in school." The discrimination included dozens of instances of bullying, racial slurs and disproportionate discipline of students who are not white, according to the complaint.
In its Dec. 28 letter, the department said it would investigate issues raised in the complaint, including charges that Native American students were subject to more severe discipline than white students, that Native American students were not properly evaluated for special-education services and that the school system failed to respond to complaints of racial harassment.
Melina Healey, an attorney for the tribes, said in an interview she was optimistic about the department's decision to investigate "persistent discrimination and mistreatment" of Native American students in Wolf Point schools.
"I hope it will lead to necessary resolution and much-needed reforms in the district," she said.
Healey said the Education Department has authority to instruct the school system to revise its policies to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws and, if the district fails to do so, can refer the case to the Justice Department for follow-up.
Education Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill confirmed the Office for Civil Rights has three open investigations into Wolf Point and two additional cases under evaluation. She declined further comment because the investigations are ongoing.
The department's letter announcing the investigation arrived shortly after publication last month of a lengthy article by the New York Times and ProPublica detailing the allegations and their impact on Native American students on the reservation.
Jeana Lervick, an attorney with the firm representing the Wolf Point School District, said in an email the system had been notified by the Education Department about the investigation and would cooperate. Wolf Point schools, she wrote, "work exceptionally hard to ensure that all students receive an excellent education, and we are extremely concerned about the allegations."
Wolf Point Schools Superintendent Rob Osborne did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation.
Wolf Point, the largest town on the Fort Peck reservation, has a population of 2,600 and is 57 percent Native American. Although they are a majority, tribe members do not control the school board and, according to the original complaint, the native representatives on the board are often overruled on issues that affect native students.
"Non-Native domination of the District has created a culturally unwelcoming school environment for Native students," the complaint reads. "It undermines Native students' sense that they can be future teachers and school leaders, further perpetuating their under-representation."
Healey, the attorney for the tribes, said Friday that she was not aware of any changes made by the school system to address charges made in the original complaint.
"We hope the school district will start to listen to and include the native families and students that they've mistreated and discriminated against for years," she said. That process, she said, would include investment in Native American cultural competency for teachers and staff, reducing suspensions and expulsions of native students, and adding native faculty and staff.
For Roxanne Gourneau, a tribe member whose children and grandchildren attended school in the system, the announcement of an investigation signaled a solution could be in sight.
"The school district has done more to fuel Native students' trauma than to support their education," she said in a statement Friday. "Change is long overdue. I am hopeful that this investigation by the DOE may finally bring that change."

Saudis pay Sudanese children to fight

Texto completo: KHARTOUM, Sudan - The civil war in Darfur robbed Hager Shomo Ahmed of almost any hope. Raiders had stolen his family's cattle, and a dozen years of bloodshed had left his parents destitute.
Then, around the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia offered a lifeline: The kingdom would pay as much as $10,000 if Hager joined its forces fighting 1,200 miles away in Yemen.
Hager, 14 at the time, could not find Yemen on a map, and his mother was appalled. He had survived one horrific civil war - how could his parents toss him into another? But the family overruled her.
"Families know that the only way their lives will change is if their sons join the war and bring them back money," Hager said in an interview last week in the capital, Khartoum, a few days after his 16th birthday.
The United Nations has called the war in Yemen the world's worst humanitarian crisis. An intermittent blockade by the Saudis and their partners in the United Arab Emirates has pushed as many as 12 million people to the brink of starvation, killing some 85,000 children, according to aid groups.
Led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudis say they are battling to rescue Yemen from a hostile faction backed by Iran. But to do it, the Saudis have used their vast oil wealth to outsource the war, mainly by hiring what Sudanese soldiers say are tens of thousands of desperate survivors of the conflict in Darfur to fight, many of them children.
At any time for nearly four years as many as 14,000 Sudanese militiamen have been fighting in Yemen in tandem with the local militia aligned with the Saudis, according to several Sudanese fighters who have returned and Sudanese lawmakers who are attempting to track it. Hundreds, at least, have died there.
Almost all the Sudanese fighters appear to come from the battle-scarred and impoverished region of Darfur, where some 300,000 people were killed and 1.2 million displaced during a dozen years of conflict over diminishing arable land and other scarce resources.
Most belong to paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a tribal militia previously known as the Janjaweed. They were blamed for the systematic rape of women and girls, indiscriminate killing and other war crimes during Darfur's conflict, and veterans involved in those horrors are now leading their deployment to Yemen - albeit in a more formal and structured campaign.
Some families are so eager for the money that they bribe militia officers to let their sons go fight. Many are ages 14 to 17. In interviews, five fighters who have returned from Yemen and another about to depart said that children made up at least 20 percent of their units. Two said children were more than 40 percent.
To keep a safe distance from the battle lines, their Saudi or Emirati overseers commanded the Sudanese fighters almost exclusively by remote control, directing them to attack or retreat through radio headsets and GPS systems provided to the Sudanese officers in charge of each unit, the fighters all said.
"The Saudis told us what to do through the telephones and devices," said Mohamed Suleiman al-Fadil, a 28-year-old member of the Bani Hussein tribe who returned from Yemen at the end of last year. "They never fought with us."
A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement that it was fighting to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemen and that coalition forces upheld all international humanitarian and human rights laws, including "abstaining from child recruitment."
"The allegations that there are children among the ranks of the Sudanese forces are fictitious and unfounded," spokesman Turki al-Malki said in the statement. Saudi officials said their soldiers have also died in Yemen, but declined to disclose how many.
President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan has gained valuable allies, easing his international isolation after years as a virtual pariah.
The United States has designated Bashir's government a state sponsor of terrorism for more than two decades. The International Criminal Court has issued warrants for his arrest, charging him with directing the Darfur war crimes.
The war in Yemen, however, has enabled Bashir to win at least diplomatic support from its Gulf leaders, and he has thanked the Saudis and Emiratis for pressing Washington to upgrade relations.
The Saudi payments to the soldiers have become increasingly significant to Sudan, where inflation has hit 70 percent and even in the capital residents line up for bread, fuel and bank withdrawals. At least nine people have been killed in the past month by security forces.

Texto completo: President Trump denied a Friday report that he’s weighing whether to install Jim Webb, a former Democratic senator, as the next defense secretary.

Trump pushed back on a New York Times report, referring to it as "fake news," that said his administration was considering Webb for the top post at the Department of Defense.

“I’m sure he is a fine man, but I don’t know Jim, and never met him,” Trump said.

Trump also expressed confidence in acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive. Trump appointed Shanahan to the role after Jim Mattis stepped down in December. Mattis had said he would stay in the position until the end of February, but Trump moved up his departure by two months.

Webb represented Virginia in the Senate for one term and ran as a candidate in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries.

He was also appointed by former President Ronald Reagan in 1987 as secretary of the Navy.

Texto completo: The Trump White House isn't big on sharing information or answering questions asked on behalf of the public.
The so-called daily briefings are not even monthly.
The "communications" office specializes in stonewalling, often not even deigning to issue a "no comment."
So White House correspondents must rely on inside sources, direct observation, documents and other reportorial wiles to perform their jobs: informing citizens about what the executive branch is up to.
When they do, President Donald Trump is quick to trash-talk them.
"The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House," went one broadside after the many departures among his top appointees were reported.
"Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy!"
But the reporting he criticizes as false - he claims it is invented from sources that don't exist - is validated every time top officials leave the White House staff and give on-the-record interviews.
Take, for instance, an article based on an interview with just-departed Chief of Staff John Kelly by Molly O'Toole in the Dec. 30 Los Angeles Times, which carried some remarkable headline words: that Kelly's time as Trump's top aide "is best measured by what the president did not do."
That Kelly was, in other words, often in the position of restraining a whimsical and incurious president.
If that sounds more like chaos than "great energy," consider this passage from the same article:
"Kelly faulted the administration for failing to follow procedure and failing to anticipate the public outrage for the two most controversial initiatives of his tenure: Trump's travel ban in January 2017, and the 'zero tolerance' immigration policy and family separations this year.
"Shortly after taking office, Trump issued an executive order immediately suspending the entire U.S. refugee program for 120 days, indefinitely freezing the entry of refugees from Syria and barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.
"Refugees already approved for resettlement, green card holders and others were turned away from flights, detained, and in some cases deported. Federal judges issued emergency stays, and several iterations of the travel ban have been challenged in court.
"At the time, despite reports he'd been caught off-guard by the president's order, Kelly gave a full-throated defense.
" 'I had very little opportunity to look at them' before the orders were announced, Kelly acknowledged in The Times interview."
In other words, media reports that Kelly, then secretary of homeland security, had been caught off-guard by this impetuous blunder were accurate.
And Kelly's defense, at that time, was a charade.
"It's remarkable that Kelly now admits the chaos of travel ban implementation ... when he previously lied to the public and press," CNN senior justice reporter Evan Perez said, responding on Twitter to the Los Angeles Times interview.
Perez added: "The reporting, it turns out, was spot on. Kelly was lying."
And Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent for the New York Times, made a broader point about the coverage overall: "The current theme out of some in the WH comms shop is 'there's no chaos to see in this White House,' a narrative Trump has hoped will replace the actual reporting. This Kelly interview affirms most of the real-time reporting about how it is there."
This is far from the first time that top Trump officials have validated real-time reporting in after-the-fact interviews.
Just weeks ago, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in an interview with CBS News' Bob Schieffer, described the president as someone who is "pretty undisciplined, doesn't like to read," isn't interested in deeply understanding policy decisions, and who repeatedly attempted to do illegal things." (Trump responded by calling Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, "dumb as a rock.")
The situation Tillerson and Kelly have described is far closer to what the mainstream media reported than to what Trump claimed a few months ago: "The White House is truly, as you would say, a well-oiled machine. It is working so well."
This doesn't mean, of course, that every anonymously sourced White House report turns out to be accurate to the letter. (After all, rumors of Kelly's departure circulated for months before he actually departed.)
But it does suggest that news reports describing high staff turnover, impulsive decision-making, an increasingly isolated chief executive and a chaotic atmosphere are valid. Far from being made up out of whole cloth, they are quite an accurate representation of an unsettling reality - despite what Trump would have us believe.
In a particularly unhinged-sounding tweet on Tuesday, the president sent New Year's greetings to the nation, including "the fake news media."
Presidential good wishes? Or just wishful thinking?

Texto completo: Valley News Staff Writer
Before deciding whether to see Lobster War: The Fight Over the World’s Richest Fishing Grounds at Woodstock Town Hall Theatre next week, Upper Valley cinephiles need to distinguish David Abel’s new documentary from Lobster Wars, plural.
While Lobster Wars, a six-part reality TV series that ran on the Discovery Channel in 2007, followed fishermen from the United Kingdom pursuing crustaceans over Georges Bank, the feature Lobster War (singular) focuses on American and Canadian lobstermen pursuing the creatures around an island off Maine’s Down East that both countries claim.
Abel is screening Lobster War, which does not yet have a distributor, at venues around New England. The veteran print journalist’s current tour, which follows a round of film-festival appearances, is scheduled to begin in the fishing town of Gloucester, Mass., tonight and to make its Vermont premiere in Woodstock on Wednesday.
“My first two docs were on cable, on network distribution deals that hemmed us in except for the odd festival,” Abel, who writes about environmental issues for the Boston Globe, said during a telephone interview on Wednesday. “This is the first time I’ve decided to go the theater route.
“It’s really gratifying to show your work, to meet folks who are really interested in these issues.”
Climate change is the issue at the center of Lobster War, which documents a dispute between fishermen from Maine and Atlantic Canada. Over the last decade, with ocean waters warming off the New England coast, lobsters have been migrating north and east in search of colder waters for breeding, many of them are now clustering in a 277-square-mile patch of ocean described in the movie as a “Gray Zone” around Machias Seal Island.
“It was a way to show how climate change is not some distant, abstract threat,” Abel said. “It’s one that is having a very tangible effect on people’s lives very much in the present, not just decades down the line.”
To capture that effect, Abel and cinematographer Andy Lau spent months on lobster boats on both sides of the border, and interviewed scientists and government regulators.
“I was very grateful that the people we made the film about allowed us into their world, to tell the larger story,” Abel said. “I had written about it in the paper some years before, and it wasn’t a story that a lot of the fishermen appreciated because they weren’t eager to broadcast the conflict. At the same time, they understood that we were trying to take a lot more time than I could with a 1,200-word story.”
Lobster War is the second collaboration between Abel and Lau, who had taken one of Abel’s print-journalism classes at Emerson College. In 2015, they shot Sacred Cod: The Fight for a New England Tradition, which the Discovery Channel broadcast in 2016.
“I’d been writing about the fishing industry for a while, and found it kind of a challenging world to plunge into,” Abel said. “There’s so much jargon involved with the regulations, and there are all kinds of vying perspectives to try to cover. There’s a human drama and an environmental drama that sometimes collide. I’d written 800 words here, 1,000 words there and I felt like there was a broader story, a wider narrative to tell.”
The New York City-born Abel has been telling stories in print since the 1990s, in a career that includes a stint as an general assignment reporter for The Palm Beach Post and then several years of freelancing for a variety of publications, on stories ranging from wars in the Balkans to Hugo Chavez’ rise to power in Venezuela.
And during his first few years at the Globe, he clung to a print reporter’s “prejudice against anything that had someone mugging for the camera, particularly in TV news.”
That all changed at the Boston Marathon in 2013. For a Nieman Fellowship project at Harvard, he was following 3-foot-9 Juli Windsor, a woman with dwarfism, in her attempt to run the full 26.2-miles. With Windsor half a mile from the finish in Copley Square, the two bombs planted by the infamous Tsarnaev brothers exploded, killing three spectators and wounding dozens. In the ensuing chaos, Abel posted the first online report on the Globe website and then wrote a first-person story that was part of the Globe’s Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the attack.
“And when the bombs went off,” he recalled, “I was still wearing a camera.”
Abel returned to Windsor’s story, first with the documentary 25.7: In Twice the Steps, which ran on the cable channel Pivot. A year after the bombing, Able ran the full Boston course with Windsor, filming her along the way for Undaunted: Chasing History at the Boston Marathon, which BBC World News and the Discovery Life channel both ran.
“From there,” Abel said, “I just sort of kept going.”
He added that the Globe has given him the flexibility to moonlight on film projects that dovetail with his print work.
“Filmmaking is a skill I’m still learning,” Abel said. “Going back and forth between the mediums is still a work in progress.
“I kind of want to have a foot in both worlds as long as I can.”
Pentangle Arts screens Lobster War at Woodstock’s Town Hall Theatre on Wednesday night at 6, following a one-hour reception. Admission is by donation. For more information about the movie, visit lobsterwar.com.
Our ‘Times’ Even though I saw Page One: Inside the New York Times shortly after its release in 2011, I’m tempted to revisit the documentary next week, when the Woodstock Vermont Film Series screens it at 3 and 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 12 at Billings Farm and Museum.
In addition to the day-in-the-life approach to revealing the many dilemmas and decisions that go into putting out a paper, all while trying to stay afloat in the midst of the Great Recession and the disorienting changes wrought by the internet, Page One, filmed in 2010, revolves around the world view of David Carr, the veteran journalist who recovered from drug addiction to become the Times’ acclaimed media columnist. Carr died of pneumonia, at age 59, in 2015, lending the film a deeper poignancy.
To reserve tickets ($6 to $11) and learn more about the film series, visit billingsfarm.org/filmfest or call 802-457-2355.
Coming Attractions
The digital projector at Spaulding Auditorium resumes running this weekend, starting tonight at 7 with a screening of the new iteration of A Star is Born in Spaulding Auditorium.
And on Saturday night at 7 comes the vertigo-inducing documentary Free Solo, about mountain climber Alex Honnold’s 2017 climb, without ropes or pitons or other aids, of the 3,000-foot face of Yosemite National Park’s El Capitan. The cinematographer was Jimmy Chin, who shot the even more-harrowing Meru, during two expeditions to a 21,000-foot peak in India’s Himalayas.

Texto completo: SYDNEY, Australia -- It's the same thrashing guitar and rock music, but the words are different from the lyrics of Twisted Sister's hit song, and the band is not impressed.
The rock band from New Jersey has told an Australian politician to stop using its song "We're Not Gonna Take It" in his advertising campaign.
Clive Palmer, a conservative politician and mining magnate, rolled out a national marketing campaign for his center-right United Australia Party over the holiday period.
Ads from the campaign use the music from "We're Not Gonna Take It," changing the words to "Australia ain't gonna cop it." The ads criticize spending and delays related to the National Broadband Network, an infrastructure project intended to improve the country's internet speeds.
Dee Snider, the lead singer of Twisted Sister, responded on Twitter this week to questions from users who were incensed by the ad's "butchering" of the song. He said the band was considering legal action.
One of the band's guitarists, Jay Jay French, also said on Twitter that the band had not been informed that its music would be used for political purposes.
Mr. Palmer responded by suggesting that the band members were motivated by poor ticket sales. Mr. Snider is scheduled to perform in Sydney and Melbourne this month.
"Old rocker who can not sell enough tickets to their last gig need publicity," Mr. Palmer wrote in a text message to Australia's ABC News on Wednesday.
He, too, threatened to sue.
"I wrote the words personally that appear on our promotion and hold the copyright for those words," The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Mr. Palmer as saying.
If members of the band "attempt to use my lyrics in any of their songs, I'll not hesitate to take legal proceedings against them," he said. "As foreigners, they should stay out of Australian domestic politics and stay where they are. Aussies are not going to cop it at all!"
This is not the first time Twisted Sister has clashed with politicians about the song, which, when it was released in 1984, struck a chord with its themes of rebellion and freedom of choice.
Paul D. Ryan, the outgoing speaker of the United States House of Representatives, used it during his vice-presidential run with former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts in 2012. Mr. Snider's statement at the time denouncing Mr. Ryan's use of the song included the comment: "There is almost nothing on which I agree with Paul Ryan, except perhaps the use of the P90X," referring to Mr. Ryan's workout program.
Mr. Snider did, however, allow Donald Trump to use the song in his presidential campaign. Mr. Snider told Newsweek that Mr. Trump was a friend and had asked him for permission, which he gave because Mr. Trump's "rebelling" was in the song's spirit. (Mr. Snider has since said that he was "not a fan of Trump's style," though he said the president was "not being given a chance.")
Mr. Snider harkened back to the rebellion theme in further Twitter posts regarding Mr. Palmer's advertisement.
"'We're Not Gonna Take It' is a song about EVERYONE'S right to free choice," he said.
Mr. Palmer and his party "are NOT pro choice," Mr. Snider wrote. "So THIS AIN'T HIS SONG!"

Texto completo: Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.
In August 2017, I went to Houston Methodist Hospital to report on the health impacts of Hurricane Harvey: a tiny cut that marinated in floodwaters and became a raging infection; a displaced chemotherapy outpatient whom staff members scoured the city to locate and bring in for care. Some workers had lost their own homes, and the chief of the heart failure and transplant division, who is under 5 feet tall, walked through floodwaters up to her chin to get to work. (Billions of dollars of fortifications had protected Methodist and other Texas Medical Center hospitals from flooding, but they became islands for a time.) Hospital executives, among the most empathetic I've ever met, camped in their offices and distributed hugs, encouragement and bonuses. The crisis extended as the storm moved east, disabling other hospitals, and ambulance crews transferred their patients to Houston.
An email about a patient from a different hospital shifted my focus, because her story offered a window into many of the most critical aspects of the region's hurricane response. Our projects can take us in unexpected directions, and we often do not know what the result, or the impact, of an investigation will be when we begin.
Cassandra Dills-Dailey, known as Casey, had undergone surgery to remove a benign adrenal tumor at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center. A doctor newly graduated from medical school discharged her before the storm hit, sending her home without a critical steroid medication.
A young mother of two boys, Casey fell critically ill after floodwater surrounded her home. Her husband, Wayne, tried to save her, phoning 911 several times starting early one afternoon until late the following morning. Call takers were overwhelmed and local first responders lacked high water vehicles and watercraft. Wayne and others turned to the internet and social media to ask for help. Regular citizens with boats arrived before emergency medical workers did, but it was already too late.
I spent months learning about the Dailey family's ordeal, studying each layer of the systems that might have saved Casey's life and the lives of others who died in similar circumstances. The family wanted answers, and they allowed me and the photographers Andrew Burton and Ilana Panich-Linsman to accompany them through the difficult days after Casey's death in the hopes that telling her story might help others. Wayne had recorded videos on his phone during the disaster and was willing to share them, as well as her medical records.
For a reporter, remarkable openness like this makes it possible to depict events in a richer way.
The investigation showed that response systems in Harris County (with more than 4.5 million residents) -- one of the most flood-prone parts of the United States in recent years -- failed to effectively prioritize those who needed lifesaving medical help in the aftermath of a major natural disaster.
Furthermore, Casey's death was never attributed to the storm by local medical examiners. That is emblematic of the widely varying practices used to account for disaster deaths. The lack of standardization robs us of a common understanding of each emergency's most profound toll and deprives some families of the federal funeral assistance they are entitled to receive. My colleagues and I documented this problem from the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico to the 2018 hurricanes.
In Casey's case, dispatching a helicopter might have saved her. But per the official system, that would have required a complex, multi-step process involving communication across various agencies. It did not happen. Realistic disaster drills might have surfaced this issue and led to streamlined procedures whereby 911 call takers could connect with helicopter dispatchers if local first responders were unable to help.
Another way to solve problems of an imperfect system is to get creative and pivot. The month after the story about the Daileys was published, I witnessed this in Pender County, N.C. A teenager experienced a diabetic crisis in a neighborhood where the roads were cut off by swift-moving water unleashed by Hurricane Florence. His brother called 911, and within about 30 minutes the Coast Guard helicopter crew with whom I was riding was alerted to the case. We landed to pick up the boy minutes later, delivering him to a hospital in time to save his life.
I went back to Pender County to report on how that had occurred. A communications expert at the county's emergency operations center had improvised, establishing direct communications with a federal air operations branch in the state capital.
In Texas that same month, Wayne Dailey was undergoing what he described as "the most surreal thing I've ever experienced in my life." Readers of the Magazine article and listeners to our podcast The Daily, which later released a two-part audio version of Casey's story produced by Annie Brown, had found Wayne on social media and reached out in droves, offering kind words and financial donations to the family's once languishing GoFundMe campaign.
The funds restored their trailer home's water service, which had been cut off, and allowed Wayne to take ownership of the 16-year-old S.U.V. that he had been trying to purchase, which had recently been repossessed. Christian Brothers Automotive Corporation later donated a new Ford Flex S.U.V. to the family. A stranger in New England who had co-founded a chain of urgent care clinics offered Wayne a job. (It was in a state far from Texas, so he did not accept it.)
Wayne received the support with enormous appreciation and a measure of guilt. He had felt terrible about not being able to save Casey. He listened to the podcast many times, finding it "kinda soothing," he wrote in a text. "My heart and mind are constantly telling me everyone has to know how Casey lost her life."
Wayne's mother, Darlene Zavertnik, urged readers to do more than donate. "Our greatest wish is to be a catalyst for change," she wrote to donors. "I encourage you to understand how the emergency system in your area operates. Don't wait until it is too late. There are many lessons to be learned from our story. Awareness and knowledge are the first step."
If reporters like me only expose what went wrong without including evidence that solutions, too, might exist, we risk imparting a false sense of inevitability. Sometimes we learn about those solutions and write about them in later stories, and sometimes our reporting allows us to incorporate them into a single story.
What seems like a small detail might resonate in unanticipated ways. For example, well into production on the Magazine story, the editor, Luke Mitchell, allowed me to add a sentence about innovations that included the fact that in Charleston County, S.C., people could provide information to 911 online.
I learned later that several 911 directors reached out to Charleston's 911 director for more information. One was John Dejung from Dane County, Wis. Hurricane Harvey had awakened him to the possibility that his 911 system, one of the largest in a state prone to ice storms, blizzards and tornadoes, might get "so bogged down or debilitated that we might want to rely on alternatives to phones." Dane County set aside $10,000 in next year's budget for the purchase of a system that will allow people to reach 911 online if necessary in a major disaster.
That alone would likely not have saved Casey's life, but it may save someone's. There are myriad ways in which we and the infrastructure and systems we rely on remain unprepared to contend with the natural disasters that seem to arrive ever more frequently and catastrophically.
All of us have a stake -- and arguably a role -- in fixing the most critical problems. But to justify making personal, professional or governmental investments, we need to understand what it looks like when we don't. Like Wayne, I want to trust that there is value in human empathy, in accountability, and in the practice, from time immemorial, of reconstructing our human tragedies in the form of narratives and sharing them.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by Democrats in the House of Representatives of Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In November she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats' House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic:
In the next Congress, 31 Democrats will represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue -- 41, if the Democrat wins the North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less. Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district's residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer, 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district's 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a cop. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trap-shooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think that that they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches. The Economist, noting that Trump's approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers -- those born between 1946 and 1964 -- who have been America's largest age cohort for more than five decades will in 2019 be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996. Boomers are -- were; they are shuffling off stage -- almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In this year's midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, the GOP, which thinks of itself as the redoubt of the devout, is competing in an increasingly secular country. The Economist says that "Nones" -- people with no religion -- "already outnumber Catholics and mainline Protestants," and in 2019 might outnumber evangelicals. "There will soon be more Nones than any single group of Christians." Ex-Catholics are 13 percent of the American population.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats' capture of New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, California, seats in November -- the Democrats lost only two seats nationally -- come January there will be no Republican from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. And there will be no Republicans from New England.
If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party -- come January, there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states (BEG ITAL)combined(END ITAL) -- they should want to emulate Bustos' success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Republicans can hope that in 2020, with Trump presumably at the top of their ticket, the turnout will be much larger and very unlike that of 2018. But analyst Charlie Cook, citing Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project, says the 2018 turnout of 50.1 percent was the highest of any midterm election since 1914. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report says Republicans lost 96 percent of House contests in districts Trump either lost or carried by less than 7 points.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked if her family did not go out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family's budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent's disposable income. Bustos' question revealed a well-honed political intuition. Democrats, she says, have to "own" districts like hers, "not rent them." This is what ownership looks like: Her four margins of victory have been 6 percentage points, 11, 20 and 24.

Silly info: We're entering a no vowel zone

Texto completo: Don't ever say "30 Second Read" deprives you of silly info needed to impress your friends. Today, vowel news turned up by 30SR's research department.
About 300 years ago, before the "Great Vowel Shift," English speakers pronounced "wind," as in blowing, to rhyme with "find," notes Classicfm.com.
That's good to know when singing the third verse of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," written in the mid-1700s. The relevant lines:
"The shepherds at those tidings
"Rejoiced much in mind,
"And left their flocks a-feeding
"In tempest, storm and wind ..."
Also, now comes a report that vowels are disappearing altogether. We'll pause for you to digest that nugget. Gulp.
Since the early 2000s, dropping vowels has become increasingly fashionable, the New York Times reports. It quoted an expert and attributed the trend in part to character limits in Twitter and to company names such as Flickr and Tumblr.
"Vowels are the distinctive thing now. The lack of them is routine," the Times notes. "Time was that you had to be an experimental weirdo to ditch vowels."

Russia's Federal Security Service said on Monday that the American, Paul N. Whelan, had been detained on Friday “during an act of espionage," and that a criminal case had been opened against him.
Conviction on a spying charge in Russia carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years.
“We noticed that he was not in communication," his parents and siblings said in a statement, “which was very much out of character for him even when he was traveling."
Whelan's twin brother, David, said Paul was in Moscow for a wedding of a fellow Marine, which took place at an upscale hotel in central Moscow on Dec. 28, the day he was detained.
"It is inconceivable to me that he would have done anything to break the law in Russia," David Whelan told The Washington Post.
A member of the US government should have visited Whelan in detention by now, according to Russia's obligations under the Vienna Convention, which dictates that consular access must be provided within a 72-hour window from the time of arrest.
But the government shutdown may have hindered this process, said a person familiar with Whelan's case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
Although US embassies are not closed during the shutdown, they are working with reduced staff. The person added that it could take months before the case is resolved.
A press officer for the State Department said by e-mail the department had been notified of the arrest by Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"We are deeply concerned for his safety and well-being," his family said in a statement. "His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected."
David Whelan described his brother as a “kind soul" who was generous and “often has stories that make you eye-roll."
Paul Whelan works as the corporate security director for BorgWarner, an automotive parts supplier based in Auburn Hills, Mich., that has business contracts in Russia. "BorgWarner has been in contact with the relevant US government authorities in order to help our employee and the US government," the company said in a statement.
Whelan is a regular visitor to Russia.
According to Whelan's brother and Russian acquaintances reached by the Post, he has been visiting Russia since 2007.
He enlisted in the Marines in 1994 and rose through the ranks to become a staff sergeant, serving two tours in Iraq, in 2004 and 2006, according to military records released to the Post.
Whelan was discharged for bad conduct in 2008 after being convicted of several charges related to larceny, according to the records.
Several Russian acquaintances described Whelan as a friendly man who greatly appreciated Russia and had a basic command of the language.
An acquaintance in St. Petersburg said the pair had made plans to meet in that city around Jan. 1, but contact with the American abruptly stopped on the day of his arrest.
Whelan's arrest comes as tensions between Washington and Moscow continue to escalate over issues including election interference, the crises in Syria and Ukraine, and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain.
Russian officials have denied any involvement in such efforts.
The timing of Whelan's arrest — coming weeks after Russian gun rights activist Maria Butina pleaded guilty to Kremlin interference in the United States — has raised questions about a potential swap. The two countries do not have an extradition treaty.
