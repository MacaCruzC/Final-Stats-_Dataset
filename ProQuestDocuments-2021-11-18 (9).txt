Texto completo: KATHMANDU, Nepal - A few years ago, Kami Rita Sherpa, a veteran climber and guide, met with a gruesome sight at Mount Everest Base Camp. Human bones poked from the ground, smooth and ice-crusted.
It was not a fluke. Subsequent seasons yielded more remains - a skull, fingers, parts of legs. Guides increasingly believe that their findings fit into a broader development on the world's highest mountain: A hotter climate has been unearthing climbers who never made it home.
"Snow is melting and bodies are surfacing," said Sherpa, who has summited Everest 24 times, a world record. "Finding bones has become the new normal for us."
In the last few seasons, climbers say they have seen more bodies lying on the icy slopes of Everest than ever before. Both the climbers and the Nepalese government believe this is the grim result of global warming, which is rapidly melting the mountain's glaciers and in the process exposing bones, old boots and full corpses from doomed missions decades ago.
The Nepalese government is struggling with what to do. More than 100 bodies may be lying on Everest, and there is an open debate about whether to remove them or leave them be.
Some climbers believe that fallen comrades have become a part of the mountain and should remain so. A number of the bodies are remarkably preserved: Sun-bleached parkas outline faces frozen into the color of charcoal.
Gelje Sherpa, a guide and six-time summiteer, said that when he first climbed Everest in 2008 he found three bodies. During a recent season, he saw at least double that number.
"They often haunt me," he said.
Over the past six decades, about 300 climbers have died during Everest expeditions, mostly from storms, falls or altitude sickness. This season has been one of the deadliest, with at least 11 fatalities, some of them partly attributable to an excess of climbers on the mountain.
The Nepalese government ' said Wednesday that it was considering changing the rules on who could climb the mountain to avoid traffic jams and unruly behavior at the summit.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has an ace in the hole for the 2020 election: The media elite cannot keep their contempt for Trump voters under wraps.
On Sunday, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd penned a sentence that perfectly encapsulates this disdain for fellow citizens.
“Mitch McConnell, Barr and almost everyone else in the G.O.P.,” Dowd opined, “have made themselves numb to [Trump’s] abhorrent actions because of self-interest.”
There you have it: In Dowd’s world - and Dowd is one of the tribunes of the Manhattan-Beltway media elite - almost every person who supports Trump today does so because of self-interest. Read “self-interest” as “greed” or a “lust for power or position,” or however you care to read it. By Dowd’s assessment, no one can possibly support Trump without being corrupt.
Ignored is the fact that Trump has delivered on his crucial pledges concerning the judiciary and defense spending. Trump has put 100-plus judges on the federal bench, including two on the Supreme Court, 41 on federal circuit courts (with two more confirmations pending), and dozens and dozens on federal trial courtss. He’s strongly supported dramatic increases in defense spending.
The roaring economy, and the tax cuts and deregulation that power it, speaks for itself. But for Dowd and her colleagues in New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley, none of this record matters. To support Trump is to be morally flawed. Let’s face it, most of the media thinks most of Trump supporters are stupid or evil. Incredibly, secular elites have appointed themselves judges of moral character.
Trump’s record is far from perfect, of course. The aluminum and steel tariffs on allies were awful choices. The pipeline of nominees to the circuit courts has inexplicably run dry. There is still no serious, detailed plan to get to the 355-ship Navy fleet Trump promised.
Most of his supporters wish for him to lay off Twitter and his personal attacks on opponents, even when those opponents swing at him daily. They would prefer the president take his “no collusion, no obstruction” win and pocket it while talking endlessly about the economy, the judges, the defense budget and deregulation.
Still, there are far more positives than negatives. Despite his biggest mistakes - the media are not the “enemy of the people” and should not be labeled thus; his indifference to staffing the government is sometimes maddening and a few of his appointees were simply not qualified - Trump has generally kept the promises he made during the campaign.
Dowd’s damning indictment calls to mind Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment. Americans outside of New York City, Washington, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley deeply resent the contempt these elites have for ordinary people.
That contempt, when openly displayed, always boomerangs. Dowd is channeling the left’s searing disdain for the “great silent majority,” which was there in the days of Richard Nixon and which showed up again in 2016. For 50 years the left has been flipping off the apolitical as well as the quiet moderate and conservative citizens who go to work and church, who raise families in somewhat prosaic fashion. But who also vote. Regularly.
To be accused of supporting Trump for evil reasons is of course to be accused of doing evil. To refuse to acknowledge the legitimate principles and policies that motivate millions of Trump voters is to brand all Trump supporters as without principles.
This contempt of the left for ordinary Americans is not new. We saw it directed at President George W. Bush (the stupid cowboy) his father (“the wimp factor”), President Ronald Reagan (another cowboy) President Gerald Ford (“played football without a helmet”) and President Richard Nixon (“Tricky Dick” decades before Watergate). The media conveniently forgets that every Republican president has had to campaign and govern against both the Democrats and their auxiliary troops in the Manhattan-Beltway media elite.
Insults and invective are not how you win elections, though they are great at winning applause and handshakes from other elites.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — In 1968, a young sportswriter named Brent Musburger wrote a column for a long-forgotten newspaper called The Chicago American. He wrote about the Olympic protests of John Carlos and Tommie Smith, who raised their black-gloved fists on the podium after winning medals in the 200-meter sprint at the Summer Games in Mexico City.
The headline on Musburger's story, according to The Nation, was "Bizarre Protest by Smith, Carlos Tarnishes Medals. "
The notable line from Musburger, who was 29 at the time: "Smith and Carlos looked like a couple of black-skinned storm troopers. "
Fifty-one years later, during a panel discussion Thursday about athletes and activism hosted by The Atlantic, Carlos was asked by moderator Jemele Hill whether he ever received an apology from Musburger for that column. Musburger, of course, went on to become a renowned sports commentator for ABC and ESPN, among others.
"Well you know, Brent Musburger doesn't even exist in my mind. So I don't even know," Carlos said to applause. "He didn't mean anything to me 51 years ago. He doesn't mean anything to me today. Because he's been proven to be wrong. "
Musburger, who is now 80, could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. However, in a 1999 interview, he told The New York Times that his column was "a bit harsh" while continuing to question the effect of the protest.
"Did it improve anything?'' Musburger told the Times two decades ago. "Smith and Carlos aside, I object to using the Olympic awards stand to make a political statement. "
Musburger, who currently works for sports gambling network VSiN and serves as the radio play-by-play voice of the Oakland Raiders, referred to Carlos and Smith's protests in his 1968 column as "a juvenile gesture by a couple of athletes who should have known better. " He also wrote that Smith would be remembered as a "militant black. "
Carlos did not return to the topic of Musburger after his initial exchange with Hill, but he did speak at length about his iconic protest during Thursday's event, which also featured appearances by U. S. hockey star Hilary Knight, former U. S. women's soccer goalkeeper Briana Scurry and former NFL player Martellus Bennett, among others.
EX-NFL PLAYER SPEAKS OUT: Martellus Bennett: White quarterback would change conversation on NFL player protests
The 73-year-old also spoke about the repercussions of his action — and how he responded to people who argued that he should "stick to sports" or "shut up and play," which has again become a familiar complaint against outspoken athletes.
"I don't pay attention to people that don't make sense," Carlos said. "They didn't make any sense to Jack Johnson, or to Jackie Robinson, because they told them the same thing. . . . All of them received the same note that they put under my door: 'Just shut up and play the game. '
"I'm not concerned about those individuals who tell me to just go out there and play sports. Because before I was an athlete, I was a human being. When I die, I will be that human being. "

Navy pilots claim UFO sightings; Unidentified objects seen flying up to 30,000 feet

Texto completo: Pilots part of the VFA-11 "Red Rippers" fighter squadron out of Naval Air Station Oceana have begun speaking up about UFOs they claim to have seen from Virginia to Florida starting about five years ago. The pilots appear in a six-part History Channel series premiering Friday called "Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation."
Lieutenants Ryan Graves and Danny Accoin, both F/A-18 Super Hornet pilots, recently told the New York Times they've seen unidentified objects that they cannot explain flying up to 30,000 feet. The strange objects appeared almost daily and had no exhaust or engine plumes, the Times reported.
"These things would be out there all day," Graves told the Times. "Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we'd expect."
Navy representatives did not respond to questions from The Virginian-Pilot on Wednesday.
The accounts come a month after the Navy acknowledged that it drafted new rules for reporting such sightings. Reports documented "unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years," officials said in a statement to Politico, which first reported the changes.
Graves' experiences started in summer 2014, he told the Times, when the squadron was training off the USS Theodore Roosevelt.
Objects, which the pilots would first ignore as false radar tracks, showed up from sea level to up to 30,000 feet, sometimes at hypersonic speeds, the Times reported.
Accoin told the newspaper he once set his plane to merge with the object.
"He should have been able to see it with his helmet camera, but could not, even though his radar told him it was there," the Times wrote.
The pilots assumed the objects were part of a drone program, but started to doubt that when one, that looked "like a sphere encasing a tube," nearly collided with a pilot one day off the coast of Virginia Beach.
They also noticed the objects could make sudden stops, starts and turns at hypersonic speed - something humans physically can't do. But they don't make any claims to know what they are.
"We're here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths," Accoin told the Times.
A declassified video of one 2015 incident, taken aboard a Super Hornet near the Florida coast, shows an unidentified, rotating object in the pilot's line of sight above the clouds. "Look at that thing!" a pilot says.
Another video, taken at 25,000 feet aboard a fighter jet from the Roosevelt, shows a pilot trying to capture an object.
"Whoa, got it!" he says. "What the (expletive) is that thing?"
The military calls the objects unidentified aerial phenomena.
The Pentagon first confirmed the existence of its Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which investigates UFO reports, in 2017 in response to a Times investigation.
That program, the Times reported, has also studied a 2004 incident in which two Navy jets encountered what pilots described as a giant white Tic Tac flying off the San Diego coast.

Biden campaign says Trump's attacks are 'beneath the dignity of the office'

Texto completo: Joe Biden's campaign swung back at President Trump on Tuesday, calling his attacks on the former vice president while traveling in Japan over the Memorial Day weekend "beneath the dignity of the office."
Members of both parties had criticized Trump in recent days after the president tweeted that he has "confidence" in North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and quoted North Korean state-run media's assessment that Biden is a "low IQ individual."
But Biden's campaign had refrained from weighing in until shortly after Trump touched down in the United States on Tuesday afternoon.
"The President's comments are beneath the dignity of the office," Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement issued moments after Marine One landed back at the South Lawn of the White House. "To be on foreign soil, on Memorial Day, and to side repeatedly with a murderous dictator against a fellow American and former Vice President speaks for itself."
Bedingfield added that Trump's actions are "part of a pattern of embracing autocrats at the expense of our institutions — whether taking [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's word at face value in Helsinki or exchanging 'love letters' with Kim Jong Un."
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended Trump's comments Sunday. Asked during an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" whether Americans should be concerned that Trump is "essentially siding with a murderous, authoritarian dictator," Sanders responded: "The president's not siding with that. But I think they agree in their assessment of former Vice President Joe Biden."
During a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday, Trump attributed the North Korean media statement about Biden's "low IQ" to Kim.
"He probably is, based on his record," Trump said of Biden. "I think I agree with him [Kim] on that."
Among those criticizing Trump for his comments was Representative Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican and a military veteran who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Kinzinger cited the Memorial Day holiday in taking issue with Trump's message.
"It's Memorial Day Weekend and you're taking a shot at Biden while praising a dictator," Kinzinger tweeted on Sunday. "This is just plain wrong."
A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the campaign held off on sending out a statement earlier in response to Trump's remarks because the vice president "is committed to respecting the sacred purpose of Memorial Day."

Navy reviewing wearing of Trump patches aboard ship
The Navy says it is reviewing whether service members violated Defense Department policy or regulations by wearing a uniform patch with the words "Make Aircrews Great Again" during President Trump's visit to their ship in Japan.
The phrase emblazoned on the patch, along with a likeness of Trump, is a play on his campaign slogan.
The military has uniform dress codes and regulations against partisan political acts while in uniform.
In a brief statement Tuesday, the Navy said only that the matter was under review by Navy leadership to ensure that the wearing of the patches did not violate policy or regulations.
Trump visited the USS Wasp assault ship on Tuesday before returning to Washington from four days in Japan.

Trump wins fight over messaging apps Nixon 'could only dream of'
Even if Trump White House personnel are using self-deleting message applications in violation of a records-preservation law, a Washington appeals court concluded that it lacks the authority to enforce day-to-day compliance.
The trio of judges — all selected by Democratic presidents — on Tuesday unanimously upheld a 2018 trial court ruling rejecting a bid by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, for an order compelling President Trump and his staff to strictly comply with the 1978 Presidential Records Act.
The law established US ownership of information and communication generated within the White House. The measure was enacted after the Watergate scandal showed destruction of some documents and led to the resignation of Richard M. Nixon, but it left the president responsible for compliance.
“Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of the technology at issue in this case: message-deleting apps that guarantee confidentiality by encrypting messages and then erasing them forever once read by the recipient," US Circuit Judge David Tatel wrote in the 14-page opinion.
Still, he and judges Nina Pillard and Harry Edwards agreed that the relief sought by CREW, together with the National Security Archive, was too vague for a legal mechanism requiring a “clear and indisputable violation." The appellate court declined to “micromanage the president's day-to-day compliance" with the act, Tatel said.
CREW filed the suit two years ago amid reports Trump aides were using self-deleting messaging apps for government communications, even after an internal memo forbade them from doing so when handling official White House business.

Trump undercuts John Bolton on North Korea and Iran
President Trump publicly undercut John R. Bolton, his national security adviser, on Iran and North Korea in recent days, raising questions about the administration's policy and personnel in the middle of confrontations with both long-term US adversaries.
During a four-day visit to Japan that ended Tuesday, Trump contradicted Bolton by saying, inaccurately, that recent North Korean missile tests did not violate United Nations restrictions. And Trump declared that he did not seek regime change in Iran, in contrast to Bolton, who has long advocated a new government in Tehran.
The president's remarks appeared to lay bare a rift with his national security adviser, who is known for his bare-knuckled approach to foreign policy. In private, Trump has made fun of Bolton's reputation for hawkishness, joking that the adviser would get him into war.
Bolton made no comment after Trump's comments. But it did not go unnoticed that the national security adviser skipped the state dinner, although it was not clear why.
Bolton and Trump have never clicked personally, according to other advisers to the president.

Texto completo: Maybe Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is correct when he says the reason for delaying the long-planned Harriet Tubman $20 bill is that he's got his hands full at the moment fighting counterfeiting. It's possible, right? The same way it's possible that President Donald Trump was denied a majority vote of the American people in 2016 because of rampant voting fraud.
In other words, hardly possible.
What is far more probable is that Trump's notorious petulance kicked in -- or at least Mnuchin thought it might, so he made sure the Tubman bill would not replace the Andrew Jackson bill until long after Trump is out of office, if ever.
Tubman was the ex-slave and abolitionist whose image was chosen to bump Jackson's after an extensive public campaign to redesign the bill. The release date was to be next year, on the 100th anniversary of the constitutional amendment that acknowledged a woman's right to vote.
Trump hated the idea. As a candidate, he branded it "pure political correctness," sounding the dog whistle for his supporters uncomfortable with the notion that women and African-Americans were the equals of white men when it came to establishing this nation of equal justice under law.
The proper place for Tubman, Trump said, was not the $20, but the rarely used $2 bill. You know -- out of sight, out of mind.
Besides, the plan for the new bill arose under Obama, and Trump appears to have a pathological need to undo anything his predecessor did, whether it be enacting the Affordable Care Act, combating climate change, protecting public land -- or diversifying the nation's currency.
The New York Times quoted senior Treasury officials as saying that Mnuchin was worried that Trump might cancel the Tubman bill altogether, so he opted to avoid the inevitable outcry by delaying the release of the bill from next year to 2028.
That will mean that Jackson, who led the deportation of Native Americans from their homes in the eastern U.S. to Oklahoma and other territories, and to whom Trump compares himself, will continue to be in circulation without any competition as long as the current president is in office.
It will also mean that for another eight years, the mini hall of fame that is the nation's paper currency will continue to be exclusively white and exclusively male. That's shameful. And it's petty.

Marc Thiessen: Assange is a spy, not a journalist. The Justice Department is right to indict him.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called WikiLeaks a "nonstate hostile intelligence service." Apparently Julian Assange agrees. In its new 18-count indictment of Assange for multiple violations of the Espionage Act, the Justice Department notes that Assange told former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning that WikiLeaks had originally described itself as an "intelligence agency" for the people.
Now, at long last, the head of that enemy intelligence agency is facing a possible 175 years in a federal penitentiary for his theft of American secrets.
The damage Assange has done is unfathomable. In 2010, he exploded what he called his "thermonuclear device" — releasing a tranche of more than a quarter of a million classified State Department diplomatic cables, all unredacted. According to the indictment, those cables "included names of persons throughout the world who provided information to the U.S. government in circumstances in which they could reasonably expect that their identities would be kept confidential. These sources included journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents who were living in repressive regimes and reported to the United States the abuses of their own government, and the political conditions within their countries, at great risk to their own safety."
The indictment cites specific examples of sources WikiLeaks burned inside China, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Moreover, Assange's decision to release 90,000 Afghanistan war-related activity reports also revealed the identities of at least 100 Afghans who were informing on the Taliban. The indictment quotes a New York Times interview with a Taliban leader who told the paper, "We are studying the report. We knew about the spies and people who collaborate with U.S. forces. We will investigate through our own secret service whether the people mentioned are really spies working for the U.S. If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them."
Assange's stolen classified documents didn't just find their way to the Taliban; the indictment points out that WikiLeaks copies were also found in Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. During the raid that killed the al-Qaida leader, U.S. forces recovered "a letter from bin Laden to another member of the terrorist organization in which bin Laden requested that the member gather the DoD material posted to WikiLeaks" as well as a response from that al-Qaida operative providing him with the secret U.S. government documents Assange had provided.
Indeed, Assange's disclosures nearly blew the bin Laden operation. Just one week before the raid, Assange released his "Gitmo files "which contained information that could have tipped off bin Laden that the CIA was closing in on him. One of Assange's stolen documents — the file on Abu Faraj al-Libi, al-Qaida's captured operational commander — revealed that Faraj had "reported on al-Qaida's methods for choosing and employing couriers, as well as preferred communications means"; that he had "received a letter from UBL's designated courier" who was "the official messenger between UBL and others in Pakistan"; and that "in mid-2003, (Faraj) moved his family to Abbottabad, and worked between Abbottabad and Peshawar," Pakistan. The CIA tracked bin Laden down to Abbottabad by following his courier, thanks, in large part, to information provided by Faraj. Had bin Laden read that document detailing what Faraj had told the agency, he could have known that the United States had made the connection between his courier and his Abbottabad hideout. Fortunately, U.S. Special Operations forces did not give bin Laden time to figure it out.
The indictment leaves out much of the damage Assange did, such as his 2014 release of classified CIA documents exposing how CIA operatives maintain cover while traveling through airports; his 2016 release of documents detailing European Union military operations to intercept refugee boats traveling to Europe from terrorist-infested regions along the Libyan coast; and his 2016 exposure of top-secret documents describing NSA intercepts of foreign government communications.
Some are concerned that the newest Assange indictment will help set a precedent to go after investigative journalists who publish classified information. But as I wrote in 2010, unlike "reputable news organizations, Assange did not give the U.S. government an opportunity to review the classified information WikiLeaks was planning to release so they could raise national security objections." So responsible journalists have nothing to fear.
Regardless, Assange is not a journalist. He is a spy. The fact that he gave stolen U.S. intelligence to al-Qaida, the Taliban, China, Iran and other adversaries via a website rather than dead-drops is irrelevant. He engaged in espionage against the United States. And he has no remorse for the harm he has caused. He once called the innocent people hurt by his disclosures "collateral damage" and admitted WikiLeaks might get "blood on our hands." Sorry, he does not get to aid and abet our enemies, put countless lives at risk and then hide behind the First Amendment. The Justice Department is right to indict him for his crimes.

A Graceful Man Who Got Over It

Texto completo: Several years after the 1986 World Series, in a hospitality suite at a postseason event, Bobby Valentine introduced a friend to Frank Cashen. To Cashen, who had built the Mets team that thwarted the Boston Red Sox in that memorable series, Valentine's guest was a legend.
"Oh, wow, Bill Buckner!" Cashen exclaimed to the man, according to Valentine, the former major league manager. "You're my favorite all-time Red Sox player!"
Valentine, a confidant of Buckner's until the day he died, on Monday at age 69, was mortified. How did Buckner respond?
"Buck wanted to kill him," Valentine said on Monday. "But he walked away, you know. He walked away."
Had it not been for his fateful error in that 1986 World Series, Buckner -- who suffered from Lewy body dementia, a degenerative brain disease -- would have been best remembered as one of the finest hitters of his generation. Instead, his legacy includes some very gaudy statistics and one terribly unfortunate mistake but also proof that there are opportunities for true grace even after one really bad night.
In a career that lasted from 1969 through 1990, Buckner compiled 2,715 hits, won a batting title, made an All-Star team and never struck out three times in a game, something 16 major leaguers did on Sunday alone.
Buckner even stole 31 bases in 1974, helping lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to the National League pennant. But that was before a severe ankle injury, and by the time he made it back to the World Series, with Boston in 1986, he had become a symbol of grit, a hobbled hero with high-top cleats who had needed nine cortisone shots just to make it through that season.
And there he was, playing first base at Shea Stadium in the 10th inning of Game 6, with the Red Sox on the verge of their first championship since 1918. At the end of every Boston victory that postseason, Red Sox Manager John McNamara had used a more mobile first baseman, Dave Stapleton. But this time he let Buckner play the field.
With two outs and the bases empty, trailing by two runs, the Mets stirred: Three singles produced a run off Calvin Schiraldi, bringing up Mookie Wilson to face another reliever, Bob Stanley. One strike from the title, Stanley's wild pitch eluded catcher Rich Gedman, tying the game, 5-5.
On the 10th pitch of his at-bat, Wilson dribbled a grounder up the first base line. Buckner did not charge it, as a more nimble Stapleton might have. He shuffled over to straddle the ball, bent over to pick it up -- and watched in disbelief as it skipped through his legs, scoring Ray Knight with the winning run.
In a 2011 interview with The New York Times, McNamara said he had no regrets about leaving Buckner in the game.
"If the ball was hit to either side of him and he couldn't get in front of it, yeah, I would have questioned myself," McNamara said. "But he got to the ball."
Even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, Wilson might have beaten him or Stanley to the bag. And as scapegoats go, Schiraldi or Stanley deserve the most blame: According to Baseball Reference, the Mets had a 1 percent chance of winning before the first of their three two-out singles, and a 60 percent chance after Stanley's wild pitch.
The Red Sox also had another game to put the Mets away, but they blew a three-run lead in the sixth inning of Game 7. As it happened, Stapleton would never play in the majors again, and Buckner would struggle to escape the shadow of his error.
"He handled it amazingly well, but it killed him," said Valentine, speaking metaphorically, of course. Valentine roomed with Buckner in the minors and played with him on the Dodgers. "There were probably 50 interviews where he could have blamed McNamara, or said something about Stanley throwing the wild pitch, or anything else about Game 6. He never said any of that."
The Red Sox released Buckner in July 1987, but the fans cheered him when he returned to the team in 1990. They did so again in 2008, when Buckner threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park the day the players received their championship rings for winning the World Series the previous October, for their second title of that decade.
At a news conference after his pitch, Buckner referred to the emphasis on his error as "the ugly part of sports," and added, "I don't think that in society in general that's the way we should operate. What are you teaching kids? Not to try because if you don't succeed then you're going to be buried, so don't try?"
Buckner succeeded wildly in his playing career -- only 65 players have amassed more hits -- and later worked as a hitting coach for the Chicago White Sox and in real estate in Idaho, where he was an avid outdoorsman.
Buckner also did autograph shows with Wilson and appeared as himself in a 2011 episode of Larry David's HBO series, "Curb Your Enthusiasm." Buckner saves a baby falling from a burning building and rides off in triumph on the shoulders of grateful onlookers.
Was it long-delayed redemption? It looked that way, but Valentine said that was not Buckner's motivation for taking the role. The reason, he said, was that Buckner's daughter was an aspiring actress and was offered a part on the show, and he wanted to help her career.

Birthplace of Memorial Day contested

Texto completo: In July 1866, a New York newspaper reported on a “grand gathering” of Union veterans in Salem, Illinois. Gen. John A. Logan, head of the fraternal group the Grand Army of the Republic, made a speech, railing against the defeated Confederates and urging rights and protections for freed slaves.
He also angrily noted that “traitors in the South have their gatherings, day after day, to strew garlands of flowers upon the graves of Rebel soldiers.”
He was bothered by reports that in towns across the South, women were decorating the graves of dead Confederates.
Two years later, he proposed the same idea. On May 5, 1868, Logan ordered the first nationwide public holiday on May 30, then known as “Decoration Day,” to honor war dead. A national day honoring American men and women who have died while serving in the military has been observed ever since.
Officially, Memorial Day started in Waterloo, N.Y.; that’s according a 1966 law signed by President Lyndon Johnson. And there was definitely a local observance of war dead there in 1866.
But here’s the thing — there’s no evidence Logan was inspired by or even aware of Waterloo’s observance when he pitched his plan.
Contemporaneous coverage doesn’t credit Waterloo either. In 1868, the New York Times said: “The ladies of the South instituted this memorial day. They wished to annoy the Yankees; and now the Grand Army of the Republic in retaliation and from no worthier motive, have determined to annoy them by adopting their plan of commemoration.”
So if the South had “their gatherings, day after day,” as Logan once complained, who in the South started it? The answer to that is complicated; according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, there are more than two dozen cities, mostly in the South, that claim to be the “birthplace of Memorial Day.”
There’s Macon, Ga., and Richmond, Va., and Columbus, Miss., which claims women there decorated the graves of both Union and Confederate soldiers on April 25, 1866, inspiring the poem The Blue and the Gray, which was published in the Atlantic the next year.
Yale historian David W. Blight has a different theory. African Americans invented Memorial Day, he has lectured, in the spring of 1865 in Charleston, South Carolina, when they reinterred the bodies of Union prisoners-of-war and decorated their graves.
There’s no evidence, however, that this commemoration led to others or was more than a one-off event.
More recently, historians have argued that who did it first isn’t what’s most important; it’s who originated the celebrations Logan learned about, was annoyed by and subsequently co-opted.
That’s the thesis of a 2014 book The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America by Daniel A. Bellware and Richard Gardiner. They trace it back to a woman named Mary Anne Williams in another city named Columbus — Columbus, Ga.
In March 1866, she sent an open letter to newspapers, saying that women in her area had been cleaning and decorating the graves of “our gallant confederate dead,” but that they thought “it is an unfinished work unless a day be set apart annually for its especial attention.”
She suggested April 26, the day Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston surrendered the Army of Tennessee near Durham, N.C.
The letter was picked up in papers across the South and arrangements were made in a number of towns and cities, Bellware and Gardiner said.
In Columbus, Miss., they got the date wrong, celebrating a day earlier — thus its claim of being the birthplace of Memorial Day.
But the honor really belongs to the Columbus in Georgia, Bellware and Gardiner said, because that’s where Williams came from, and because it was all of the Confederate grave-decorating across the South that drew Logan’s attention and — temporary — disdain.
With this in mind, in 2016, the mayor of Columbus, Ga., signed a resolution proclaiming that it, too, is the “true” birthplace of Memorial Day.

NY could ban hair-based racial discrimination

Texto completo: ALBANY — New York would become one of the first states to outlaw racial discrimination based on natural hairstyles like braids, twists and dreadlocks under a bill introduced at the state Capitol last week.
The proposal from state Sen. Jamaal Bailey, D-Bronx, and Assemblywoman Tremaine Wright, D-Brooklyn, would make clear employers and schools can't discriminate on the basis of someone's hairstyle if it is "historically associated with race."
Practically speaking, the bill would prevent employers and schools from requiring their black employees or students to straighten their hair, or setting a dress code that prevents braids, dreadlocks or similar hairstyles.
The bill was introduced three months after New York City's Commission on Human Rights issued guidelines preventing discrimination based on hair and a month after the California Senate approved a similar measure.
As it stands, New York state law prevents employer discrimination based on a variety of traits, including age, race, creed, sex and color.
Wright and Bailey's bill, which was introduced Thursday, would expand the legal definition of race to include "ancestry, color, ethnic group identification and ethnic background," including any "traits historically associated with race" such as "hair texture and protective hairstyles."
Examples of "protective hairstyles" are braids, locks and twists, among others, according to the bill.
The same definition also would be added to the state Dignity For All Students act, which deals with bullying in schools.
Bailey and Wright could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.
The proposal is similar to a measure approved unanimously by the California Senate on April 22. That measure is awaiting a vote in the California Assembly.
New York City, meanwhile, took the action unilaterally.
The city Commission on Human Rights changing its guidelines in February to make clear city residents have the right to "natural hair, treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed state," according to The New York Times.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose wife, Chirlane, is black, said his relationship with his wife dating back to the early 1990s "began my education on the question of hair."
"You know, she told me many, many stories of people, particularly women, being looked down on because they had natural hair, or because they had dreadlocks, or whatever it may be," de Blasio said in February. "And it's appalling to me that that ever went on, but it still goes on to this day."
De Blasio continued: "It's not acceptable. It must end, and we're going to lead the way here in New York City."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The strange objects, one of them like a spinning top moving against the wind, appeared almost daily from the summer of 2014 to March 2015, high in the skies over the East Coast. Navy pilots reported to their superiors that the objects had no visible engine or infrared exhaust plumes, but that they could reach 30,000 feet and hypersonic speeds.
"These things would be out there all day," said Lt. Ryan Graves, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot who has been with the Navy for 10 years, and who reported his sightings to the Pentagon and Congress. "Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we'd expect."
In late 2014, a Super Hornet pilot had a near collision with one of the objects, and an official mishap report was filed. Some of the incidents were videotaped, including one taken by a plane's camera in early 2015 that shows an object zooming over the ocean waves as pilots question what they are watching.
"Wow, what is that, man?" one exclaims. "Look at it fly!"
No one in the Defense Department is saying that the objects were extraterrestrial, and experts emphasize that earthly explanations can generally be found for such incidents. Lieutenant Graves and four other Navy pilots, who said in interviews with The New York Times that they saw the objects in 2014 and 2015 in training maneuvers from Virginia to Florida off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, make no assertions of their provenance.
But the objects have gotten the attention of the Navy, which earlier this year sent out new classified guidance for how to report what the military calls unexplained aerial phenomena, or unidentified flying objects.
Joseph Gradisher, a Navy spokesman, said the new guidance was an update of instructions that went out to the fleet in 2015, after the Roosevelt incidents.
"There were a number of different reports," he said. Some cases could have been commercial drones, he said, but in other cases "we don't know who's doing this, we don't have enough data to track this. So the intent of the message to the fleet is to provide updated guidance on reporting procedures for suspected intrusions into our airspace."
The sightings were reported to the Pentagon's shadowy, little-known Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which analyzed the radar data, video footage and accounts provided by senior officers from the Roosevelt. Luis Elizondo, a military intelligence official who ran the program until he resigned in 2017, called the sightings "a striking series of incidents."
The program, which began in 2007 and was largely funded at the request of Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was the Senate majority leader at the time, was officially shut down in 2012 when the money dried up, according to the Pentagon. But the Navy recently said it currently investigates military reports of U.F.O.s, and Mr. Elizondo and other participants say the program -- parts of it remain classified -- has continued in other forms. The program has also studied video that shows a whitish oval object described as a giant Tic Tac, about the size of a commercial plane, encountered by two Navy fighter jets off the coast of San Diego in 2004.
Leon Golub, a senior astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said the possibility of an extraterrestrial cause "is so unlikely that it competes with many other low-probability but more mundane explanations." He added that "there are so many other possibilities -- bugs in the code for the imaging and display systems, atmospheric effects and reflections, neurological overload from multiple inputs during high-speed flight."
Lieutenant Graves still cannot explain what he saw. In the summer of 2014, he and Lt. Danny Accoin, another Super Hornet pilot, were part of a squadron, the VFA-11 "Red Rippers" out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Va., that was training for a deployment to the Persian Gulf.
Lieutenants Graves and Accoin spoke on the record to The Times about the objects. Three other pilots in the squadron also spoke to The Times about the objects but declined to be named.
Lieutenants Graves and Accoin, along with former American intelligence officials, appear in a six-part History Channel series, "Unidentified: Inside America's U.F.O. Investigation," to air beginning Friday. The Times conducted separate interviews with key participants.
The pilots began noticing the objects after their 1980s-era radar was upgraded to a more advanced system. As one fighter jet after another got the new radar, pilots began picking up the objects, but ignoring what they thought were false radar tracks.
"People have seen strange stuff in military aircraft for decades," Lieutenant Graves said. "We're doing this very complex mission, to go from 30,000 feet, diving down. It would be a pretty big deal to have something up there."
But he said the objects persisted, showing up at 30,000 feet, 20,000 feet, even sea level. They could accelerate, slow down and then hit hypersonic speeds.
Lieutenant Accoin said he interacted twice with the objects. The first time, after picking up the object on his radar, he set his plane to merge with it, flying 1,000 feet below it. He said he should have been able to see it with his helmet camera, but could not, even though his radar told him it was there.
A few days later, Lieutenant Accoin said a training missile on his jet locked on the object and his infrared camera picked it up as well. "I knew I had it, I knew it was not a false hit," he said. But still, "I could not pick it up visually."
At this point the pilots said they speculated that the objects were part of some classified and extremely advanced drone program.
But then pilots began seeing the objects. In late 2014, Lieutenant Graves said he was back at base in Virginia Beach when he encountered a squadron mate just back from a mission "with a look of shock on his face."
He said he was stunned to hear the pilot's words. "I almost hit one of those things," the pilot told Lieutenant Graves.
The pilot and his wingman were flying in tandem about 100 feet apart over the Atlantic east of Virginia Beach when something flew between them, right past the cockpit. It looked to the pilot, Lieutenant Graves said, like a sphere encasing a cube.
The incident so spooked the squadron that an aviation flight safety report was filed, Lieutenant Graves said.
The near miss, he and other pilots interviewed said, angered the squadron, and convinced them that the objects were not part of a classified drone program. Government officials would know fighter pilots were training in the area, they reasoned, and would not send drones to get in the way.
"It turned from a potentially classified drone program to a safety issue," Lieutenant Graves said. "It was going to be a matter of time before someone had a midair" collision.
What was strange, the pilots said, was that the video showed objects accelerating to hypersonic speed, making sudden stops and instantaneous turns -- something beyond the physical limits of a human crew.
"Speed doesn't kill you," Lieutenant Graves said. "Stopping does. Or acceleration."
Asked what they thought the objects were, the pilots refused to speculate.
"We have helicopters that can hover," Lieutenant Graves said. "We have aircraft that can fly at 30,000 feet and right at the surface." But "combine all that in one vehicle of some type with no jet engine, no exhaust plume."
Lieutenant Accoin said only that "we're here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths."
In March 2015 the Roosevelt left the coast of Florida and headed to the Persian Gulf as part of the American-led mission fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The same pilots who were interacting with the strange objects off the East Coast were soon doing bombing missions over Iraq and Syria.
The incidents tapered off after they left the United States, the pilots said.

Texto completo: In the early 1980s, when Susan Engel was starting out as the director of the adult division at the 92nd Street Y, the vaunted cultural and community center on Manhattan's Upper East Side, she was asked to "make magic on Sunday nights." So she created a weekly lecture series that became the institution's marquee event, 92Y Talks.
Now Ms. Engel, 59, is the executive producer of the series, which still takes place on Sundays, as well as on other nights. She invites public figures to converse with notable interviewers, such as Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. and a Democratic presidential candidate, who recently spoke with Jonathan Capehart, from The Washington Post. A native New Yorker who also lives on 92nd Street, Ms. Engel, in her 37th working for the only employer she's ever had, is never far from work, physically or mentally, even on Sundays.
GROUNDS FOR RESEARCH I get up around 7:30. I don't do anything until I have my perfect cup of coffee. I'm a bit of an obsessive, so I usually have Stumptown, and I alternate between an AeroPress and an electric drip pour over. I have these high energy, Paleo bars that I make with almond butter and have with plain Stonyfield yogurt on top, and then I open the front door for The New York Times.
I scout the Times for ideas. What's coming out, who has books out. I'm always looking at the Book Review and Arts & Leisure. I have my notepad handy, and my coffee, I sit at a table and write down ideas.
I scour the paper until about 9 when I turn on the Sunday morning shows to get more ideas, but also to be on top of things myself. This is the time when I can rejuvenate and mull over what's in the zeitgeist. And then I go to yoga.
CLEAR THE CHATTER I go to an 11:15 class at Pure Yoga on 86th Street. I take a basics class. It clears the chatter in my mind. That's really it. Because my job is so much about ideas and people, I need a space where I'm not on the phone and I'm not thinking about who I am going to get to the Y next, but I'm just allowing things to be, allowing my mind to just flow.
What's interesting about this is that sometimes then new ideas come, and people I haven't even been thinking of come to mind because I'm not forcing it.
FAMILY At home, I have a little something to eat and then FaceTime with my 97-year-old mother and her caregiver in Florida. Around 3, weather permitting, I want to go for a walk around the reservoir with my daughters, Shira, 27, and Eve, 23. Shira comes in from Brooklyn and Eve lives in the same building as I do. The three of us will go for a walk around the reservoir or along the East River Promenade together. Afterward, the girls might go for coffee and catch up while I make dinner.
EARLY BIRDS Shira and Eve typically come over for dinner. I raised them mostly as a single mother, and it's very important that we spend time together. Sunday is really our only time to do so, and I make an early dinner for us because I have work on Sunday nights, just like I did when they were little, but now I no longer need to hire a babysitter. I keep it simple and get their favorite foods, which are salmon, string beans almandine, and couscous. I pick up fresh fish at Whole Food on the way home from yoga.
THE SHOW I get to the 92Y at 6:30 to prepare for that night's event, where I will introduce the moderator and the guest to the audience around 7:30. From there, I'm in the green room watching the show on the monitor; and also curating some of the audience questions written on cards that are collected by ushers. I pick out six to eight questions to bring out to the moderator, all the while listening intently to make sure questions I planned to bring out haven't already been covered in the talk. Around 9 the show wraps up, and I stay around for any book signings we might have in the adjacent art gallery.
UNWIND I go home and have a glass of red wine. I might read a novel or a short story or I may have a snack, and I do get on email and respond to things because I've been disconnected. I also text with my mother's caregivers. I'll catch up on shows I've missed during the week, typically, "This Is Us."
I go to bed around midnight. It's hard to just kind of go to bed right away. I still get excited by the events. The live event experience has a certain feeling, an intimacy, that you don't get online or onscreen. When an audience gives a standing ovation, there a certain feeling of people coming together, and that's very gratifying.

Texto completo: President Trump on Sunday will award a 60-pound trophy to the next sumo champion in Tokyo, Japan.
He will be the first U.S. president to present a trophy to the winner of the summer wrestling tournament while on his visit to the country. However, there has been some question over what the trophy will look like and whether it will have Trump's name on it.
A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson would only say that it will be a "president's cup" and a senior White House confirmed to reporters that the President's Cup is 54 inches tall and weighs 60 to 70 pounds.
Trump is the guest of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who made special accommodations for Trump to attend the championship.
The New York Times reported that some in Japan were upset that a Japanese traditional sport was being turned into a political spectacle. Ticket holders were removed from their seats so that Trump could attend the iconic Japanese event. Trump will wear a pair of slippers when entering the ring to present the trophy, as shoes are not permitted to worn in the ring.
But others see the event as befitting Trump, who likes to promote a muscular U.S. policy and had been part of American entertainment wrestling shows for decades.
Trump's attendance at the sumo wrestling tournament comes as the sport is in transition. Many of the new wrestlers are immigrants. The sport has also faced growing scandals over bullying and intimidation.

Pope weighs in as states debate abortion: It's like hiring a 'hitman to solve a problem'

Texto completo: Pope Francis affirmed the Catholic stance against abortion Saturday, not long after multiple U.S. states passed bills restricting abortion.
"Is it legitimate to take out a human life to solve a problem?” Francis asked attendees at a Vatican conference on abortion, according to the New York Times. “Is it permissible to contract a hitman to solve a problem?”
Francis also voiced opposition to aborting an unhealthy fetus, calling it "inhuman eugenics."
"Human life is sacred and inviolable and the use of prenatal diagnosis for selective purposes should be discouraged with strength," he said.
The pontiff's remarks echoed those he made about abortion in October, saying the procedure "suppresses innocent and helpless life in its blossoming."
State governments in Alabama, Missouri, and Georgia have recently passed strict anti-abortion laws, often making it illegal to have the procedure after six or seven weeks into the pregnancy. The new laws are seen as a way for the issue to be brought before the U.S. Supreme Court and have Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that made abortion legal, overturned.

Texto completo: Welcome to Inside Desert Politics, your guide to the happenings in Coachella Valley, California and national politics. I'm Marie McCain, your host.
In this week's column: As a growing number of entertainment industry insiders take up the call to boycott states that have passed "heartbeat bills," one California legislator introduces a plan she hopes will draw these groups back to California; and tickets are still available for the May 30 Desert Sun Storytellers event featuring stories from people affected by homelessness.
Outrage over the passage of "heartbeat bills" in a number of states has created an interesting opportunity for California — an opportunity at least one California Assembly member does not intend to pass up.
Called a "heartbeat bill" because it hangs on the moment a fetal heartbeat is detected in the womb, these extremely restrictive and controversial measures not only make it more difficult to access abortion services. They also criminalize the procedure, as well as those who perform it.
Lawmakers in Iowa, Ohio, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia and Utah have approved variations of this legislation and a number of other states are actively considering proposals in their legislatures.
So far, Alabama's version is the only one to outright ban abortion. Some of the laws in other states allow abortions up to six to eight weeks, while still others allow it well into the middle of the second trimester.
Opponents contend the legislation is unfair because most women don't even realize they're pregnant at six to eight weeks. They also object because none of the legislation includes exceptions for instances where a pregnancy can be attributed to incest or rape.
According to Vox.com, proponents of the bills include Faith2Action, which identifies itself as "the nation's largest network of pro-family groups."
The group came up with the proposal, which has been used as a model for the legislation passed in some states.
Proponents are hoping challenges to the legislation eventually lead to the U.S. Supreme Court.
"Some sponsors evidently want to set up a test case to challenge Roe v. Wade," Clarke D. Forsythe, a lawyer for Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion advocacy group, told The New York Times.
Georgia's passage of this bill, which Gov. Brian Kemp signed earlier this month, has upset many people in the film and television industry who moved their productions to Georgia because of its appealing tax breaks.
Now, in protest, at least two projects have decided to move their productions out of Georgia. Also, a coalition of actors, directors and producers have started to call for a boycott of the state that has become known — within the entertainment industry — as the "Hollywood of the South."
Enter California Assemblywoman Luz Rivas, a Democrat from Los Angeles, who believes now is the time to introduce what she calls the "California Share Our Values Film Tax Incentive." Rivas says she believes the measure will "entice entertainment production back to our state."
"My bill provides the film industry a relocation incentive during a time of national uproar that has ensued from these shameful actions of restricting access to abortion services, and the call to action from several Hollywood stars and studios to instead avoid film production in states that do not respect women or their rights," Rivas said.
"California is both a leader in women's rights and the film industry. We hope those who are filming in these regressive states will come to California and share our values," she added.
As of May 20, the proposal is still being considered by the Senate Rules Committee.
Coachella Valley Storytellers Project For the past year, The Desert Sun has been investigating homelessness in the Coachella Valley.
We have interviewed more than 200 individuals experiencing homelessness and have dug into the local social service structures. Join us on May 30 for a night of stories by those we have met who have been affected by homelessness as well as an advocacy fair before and after the show. Storytellers will share their struggles and successes.
Community members will learn how they can access services and what volunteer opportunities are available in the Coachella Valley.
The advocacy fair will begin at 5 p.m. Storytelling will begin at 6:30 p.m.
Tickets are now on sale and frequently sell out days to weeks in advance, so plan to buy your tickets as soon as possible at https://tickets.desertsun.com/.

KILLING PAX AMERICANA TRUMP'S TRADE WAR IS ABOUT MORE THAN ECONOMICS

Texto completo: OK, they weren't supposed to start the trade war until I got back from vacation. But I thought I might take a few minutes to address two misconceptions that, I believe, are coloring discussion of the trade conflict.
By the way, I don't mean President Donald Trump's misconceptions. As far as I can tell, he isn't getting a single thing about trade policy right.
But Mr. Trump's critics, while vastly more accurate than he is, also, I think, get a few things wrong, or at least overstate some risks while understating others. On one side, the short-run costs of trade war tend to be overstated. On the other, the long-term consequences of what's happening are bigger than most people seem to realize.
In the short run, a tariff is a tax. Period. The macroeconomic consequences of a tariff should therefore be seen as comparable to the macroeconomic consequences of any tax increase. True, this tax increase is more regressive than, say, a tax on high incomes, or a wealth tax. This means that it falls on people who will be forced to cut their spending, and is therefore likely to have a bigger negative bang per buck than the positive bang for buck from the 2017 tax cut. But we're still talking, at least so far, about a tax hike that is only a fraction of a percent of GDP.
This means that it's hard to justify claims that the trade war, at least what's currently in the pipeline, will cause a global recession.
If the trade war expands not just to all imports from China but to imports from Europe and other parts of the world, we could get this up to a contractionary fiscal policy of a couple of points of GDP; $200 billion here, $200 billion there, and soon you're talking about real money. And that certainly could happen: Mr. Trump imagines that he's winning, and might well move on from China to European cars and so on. But we're not there yet.
But doesn't the prospect of foreign retaliation change the picture? Actually, what foreign retaliation does is prevent tariffs from being less bad than an ordinary tax increase. When a large country like the U.S. imposes tariffs, one effect - if we don't face foreign retaliation - is a rise in the price of U.S. exports, either though a rise in the dollar or by drawing resources away from export- to import-competing sectors. This price rise is, other things equal, a gain for America (although not for export-oriented sectors like agriculture.) And this "terms of trade" effect can mitigate or even reverse the overall losses as tariffs distort the economy.
If (when) foreigners retaliate, however, the terms of trade effect goes away, and we're back to tariffs just being a tax on domestic consumers.
Maybe the larger point here is that there tends to be a certain amount of mysticism about trade policy: Yes, trade policy is important; but in terms of the strict economics it's not more important than health policy, or fiscal policy, or policy in general.
All of this, however, is only about the strict economics of a trade war, which may be the least important aspect of what's happening.
For trade policy isn't just about economics. It's also about democracy and peace.
This is obvious and explicit in Europe, where the origins of the European Union lie in the Coal and Steel Community of the early 1950s - an agreement whose economic benefits, while real, were in a way incidental to its real purpose, preventing any future wars between France and Germany. And membership of the EU has always been contingent on democratization.
It's more implicit in the case of the United States. But the historical record is pretty clear: the postwar trading system grew out of the vision of Cordell Hull, FDR's secretary of state, who saw commercial links between nations as a way to promote peace. That system, with its multilateral agreements and rules to limit unilateral action, was from the beginning a crucial piece of the Pax Americana.
And Mr. Trump's trade war should correspondingly be seen as part and parcel of his embrace of foreign dictators, lack of respect for our allies, and evident contempt for democracy, at home as well as abroad.
But wait, you say: China is neither an ally nor a democracy, and it is in many ways a bad actor in world trade. Isn't there a reasonable case for confronting China over its economic practices?
Yes, there is - or there would be if the tariffs on Chinese products were an isolated story, or better yet if Mr. Trump were assembling an alliance of nations to confront objectionable Chinese policies. But, in fact, Mr. Trump has been waging trade war against almost everyone, although at lower intensity. When you're imposing tariffs on imports of Canadian steel, on the ludicrous pretense that they endanger national security, and are threatening to do the same to German autos, you're not building a strategic coalition to deal with a misbehaving China.
What you're doing, instead, is tearing down what's left of the Pax Americana.
Wasn't this inevitable in any case? I don't think so. True, U.S. economic dominance has been eroding over time, not because we're getting poorer, but because the rest of the world is getting richer. But there was reason to hope that a relatively peaceable international order could be sustained by an alliance of democratic powers.
At this point, however, things look a lot bleaker. It's not just Mr. Trump. And it's not even just Mr. Trump plus Brexit. The Europeans are also turning out to be a big disappointment. As I said, if they can't even deal with the likes of Viktor Orban within their own community, they're definitely not up to providing the kind of leadership the world needs.
But where the Europeans are weak, Mr. Trump is malign. He's working actively to make the world a more dangerous, less democratic place, with trade war just one manifestation of that drive. And the eventual negative consequences for America and the world will be much bigger than anything we can capture with economic modeling of the effects of tariffs.

Texto completo: Free speech concerns cited over decision to bring Espionage Act case
Two prosecutors involved in the case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange argued against the Justice Department's decision to accuse him of violating the Espionage Act because of fear that such charges posed serious risks for First Amendment protections and other concerns, according to people familiar with the matter.
The previously undisclosed disagreement inside the Justice Department underscores the fraught, high-stakes nature of the government's years-long effort to counter Assange, an Internet-age publisher who has repeatedly declared his hostility to U.S. foreign policy and military operations. The Assange case also illustrates how the Trump administration is willing to go further than its predecessors in pursuit of leakers - and those who publish official secrets.
The internal Justice Department debate over how, or whether, to prosecute Assange stretched back to the Obama administration, which ultimately decided that such charges were a bad idea but did not formally close the case.
The case was dormant when the Trump administration began, but in 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, eager to demonstrate his zeal for pursuing anti-leak investigations, urged the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia to take a second look at prosecuting Assange.
In a sign of how seriously they took their task, one of the assistant U.S. attorneys asked to evaluate the case was James Trump, an aggressive veteran prosecutor with experience in intelligence leak matters.
James Trump was part of the team that won criminal convictions in 2015 against former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, who was charged with leaking classified information to journalist James Risen. Prosecutors in that case had taken the dramatic step of seeking to compel Risen to reveal his source in court. The prosecution team in that case wanted to jail Risen until he cooperated with investigators, but that plan was scuttled by then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., according to people familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
When it came to Assange, James Trump was concerned about pursuing a prosecution that was so susceptible to First Amendment and other complicated legal and factual challenges, the people familiar with the matter said.
Another prosecutor, Daniel Grooms, also disagreed with charging Assange, according to the people familiar with the matter. At the time, Grooms served as criminal chief in the U.S. Attorney's office that was handling the case.
Prosecutors debated the case internally for months, with James Trump and Grooms advocating against Espionage Act charges, the people said. By the time prosecutors actually charged Assange, James Trump had offered his opinion and was no longer part of the discussions, and Grooms left the Justice Department last month for unrelated reasons, these people said.
A Justice Department official said James Trump, who was not part of the original investigative team, offered to remain on board in whatever capacity his supervisors wanted after delivering his opinion. It was determined he had significant other case work and the team could proceed without his assistance, the official said.
It is not uncommon for prosecutors to internally debate or disagree about whether a particular case merits criminal charges; in the Assange case, however, the disagreement involved major questions about constitutional rights.
Grooms declined to comment; James Trump referred a reporter to Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria, Va., who said in a statement, "We do not respond to anonymously sourced statements. Department of Justice policy prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of non-public, sensitive information."
Part of the concern among Justice Department veterans was that prosecutors had looked at the same evidence for years during the Obama administration and determined such charges were a bad idea, in large part because Assange's conduct was too similar to that of reporters at established news organizations.
People familiar with the Assange case said that the Justice Department did not have significant evidence or facts beyond what the Obama-era officials had when they reviewed the case.
On Thursday, senior Justice Department officials announced an 18-count indictment against Assange, accusing him of conspiring with former Army Pfc. Chelsea Manning in 2010 to obtain and disseminate secret government documents. The charges alarmed First Amendment experts, who called them a threat to press freedoms.
Assange, 47, has spent years in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London, but after his asylum was revoked, British police arrested him last month and U.S. prosecutors unsealed a one-count indictment charging he conspired with Manning to try to hack a government computer password.
Law enforcement officials described that initial, single charge as a placeholder, and said officials had planned for months to charge Assange with Espionage Act violations, each one of which carries a potential 10-year prison sentence.
The new indictment accuses Assange of providing direction to Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst who shared hundreds of thousands of classified war logs and diplomatic papers with WikiLeaks. Manning is in jail for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating Assange.
Assange is fighting extradition in the British courts, a process that could take years.
Jacques Semmelman, a New York lawyer who specializes in extradition cases, said the U.K. government is likely to reject the Espionage Act charges against Assange, due to an exemption in the extradition treaty for political offenses.
"It is a classic political offense. I have a difficult time seeing a British court departing so significantly from legal tradition and saying in this case they will make an exception," said Semmelman. "The political offense exception as it has existed for probably 150 years has consistently maintained that for espionage charges, they are not extraditable. That's just a classic principle of international extradition law."
Semmelman said U.S. prosecutors have a better chance of getting Assange extradited on the single hacking conspiracy charge, but added that the lengthy Espionage Act indictment makes even that task more difficult.
In announcing the indictment, U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger said Assange was "not charged simply because he is a publisher" but rather for "publishing a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also allegedly published the unredacted names of innocent people who risked their safety and freedom to provide information to the United States and its allies."
Assange's lawyer, Barry Pollack, countered Thursday that the charges reveal "the gravity of the threat the criminal prosecution of Julian Assange poses to all journalists in their endeavor to inform the public about actions that have been taken by the U.S. government."
Legal experts said the Assange charges suggest the Trump administration is trying to rewrite the legal balance between government secrecy and press freedom struck by the Supreme Court in the landmark 1971 case known as the Pentagon Papers.
"What the Pentagon Papers established is that the press is to be protected, and the government has generally followed that," said Genevieve Lakier, a First Amendment expert at the University of Chicago.
The Assange indictment is "blurring the line between a member of the press and a leaker," she said, by stretching the definition of complicity. "That could be really, really bad for the press, particularly in a period where there's much more hostility towards the press."
Because this kind of prosecution has never been attempted before, she said, "We just don't have a lot of very clear case law on how far reporters can go to protect their sources. It's a very thin line; when you're working with someone, you're often enabling them, helping them, protecting them, and if there's any collaboration, now you're in a conspiracy."
She also noted that the prosecution might have been made possible in part because Assange himself challenged those lines.
James Goodale, who was general counsel for the New York Times during the Pentagon Papers case, called the Assange indictment "highly outrageous."
Goodale said he feared the government was trying to interpret the Espionage Act so broadly to cover any kind of communication, in order to expand the reach of government secrecy rules.
"It's the same stupid statute, trying to be applied in a different and a really more heinous way," he said.

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington, there’s a lot. More than usual. Too many different things. Let’s get on with it.
An Omar story not about Tweets
In 2016, Lowry Grove was a mobile park still home to 90 families. In 2017, real estate developers in St. Anthony were entertaining a grand design familiar to most rapidly changing neighborhoods around the country: What if the land had luxury apartments on it instead?
“The closure of the Lowry Grove mobile home park in St. Anthony really exemplifies what this bill is designed to prevent,” Rep. Ilhan Omar, MN-3, told MinnPost. “Ninety families were kicked out of their homes with little notice.”
Omar, who represents Minneapolis and some of its suburbs, introduced the Manufactured Housing Community Sustainability Act (H.R.2832), which uses tax credits to incentivize owners of mobile home communities to sell their property to residents. Read more at MinnPost.
Taking the pulse of Minnesota soybean farmers
Soybean farmers in Minnesota are struggling amidst an escalating trade war between the Trump administration and China, with virtually no information from Federal officials as to what will happen next. Read more at MinnPost.
The President on Thursday unveiled a $16 billion bailout for farmers hurt by the conflict.
“That’s a market that farmer’s have literally built with their own funds to be able to trade with the Chinese,” Jamie Beyer, a soybean farmer from Wheaton , told MinnPost. “And that trade was completely stopped last year.”
In her role as the Vice President of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association , Beyer went visit Sen. Amy Klobuchar to talk about the conflict. “She was pulling her hair. Literally,” Beyer said of Klobuchar. “She said: ‘There’s no plan. No one’s talking to the USDA. There’s no one talking to us. There’s no one working on this trade deal.’”
Since then, Klobuchar has not seen a drastic difference in the way that policy is being made.
“Our country needs to get back to the negotiating table, and making trade policy one tweet at a time is not going to get us there,” Klobuchar told MinnPost. “Bushels of soybeans are sitting in silos and farm families are paying the price. This is real, people are suffering, and small farms are going under.”
The tax Mnuchin
♪ Let me tell you how it will be ♪ On Monday, a Federal Judge ruled that Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin must release President Trump’s tax returns to Congress, days after Mnuchin said he would defer to the courts on if he has the legal responsibility to do so. The Trump administration contends that Congress is not requesting the tax returns for a legitimate “legislative purpose,” and therefore the request should not be granted.
“The Judge says it all,” Klobuchar said on Twitter. “‘It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President..would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct-past or present-even without opening an impeachment inquiry.’”
On Wednesday, another Federal judge ruled that the President could not stop Congress from obtaining his financial records via another route — his business with Deutsche bank.
McCollum and mining
Rep. Betty McCollum , MN-4, released legislation this week to mandate that the U.S. Forest service finishes the canceled environmental study on the impact of copper mining in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) in the northern part of the state.
McCollum’s move is not surprising considering the pace of actions in the BWCAW. The Bureau of Land Management renewed the lease for Twin Metals Minnesota last week, moving Chilean mining company Antofagasta closer to building the proposed copper-nickel mine. Both Rep. Tom Emmer, MN-6, and Rep. Pete Stauber, who represents the area, were in attendance.
McCollum has been gearing up for a challenge with the Trump administration’s environmental policy deregulatory actions since becoming Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies. MinnPost’s Walker Orenstein covered McCollum’s prioritization of the BWCA last year, as well as her expanded influence.
“The policy that gets implemented is influenced by the dollars that are appropriated to them,” McCollum told MinnPost in 2018.
Minnesota delegation pens two bipartisan letters in one week
Something unusual: All ten congressional members from the state managed to agree on not one, but two things this week: 1, asking the President to designate a non-presidential state funeral for the last surviving WW2 Medal of Honor recipient and 2, asking the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie to examine Minnesota’s efforts to address veteran homelessness and see if the VA could learn anything.
“This would serve as a distinguished recognition to those who received the Medal of Honor during World War II and all 16 million American men and women who served in uniform during the conflict, including 326,000 Minnesotans.” You can read the full letter here.
“We write regarding the urgent need to address veteran homelessness and to highlight efforts by the state of Minnesota to address this critical issue, which could serve as a model for the rest of the country,” the members wrote. And you can read the second letter here.
House civil-rights vote
Last Friday, the House passed major civil rights legislation (236-173) that would expand civil rights protections to both sexual orientation and gender. While many states do not have laws on the books to offer these protections, Minnesota is one of the handful that does. The Minnesota Human Rights Act , first signed into law in 1973, was the first state legislation to acknowledge these protections as law.
* Yes: Rep. Angie Craig, MN-2; Rep. Dean Phillips, MN-3; Betty McCollum , MN-4, Rep. Ilhan Omar , MN-5.
* N0: Rep. Jim Hagedorn , MN-1; Rep. Pete Stauber , MN-8; Rep. Tom Emmer , MN-6.
* N/A: Rep. Collin Peterson, MN-7, co-sponsored the bill, but was not in attendance during the day for the legislative session.
Although no Republicans in the Minnesota House delegation voted for the bill, eight House Republicans in total voted for the bill, with two of them co-sponsoring the legislation: Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Rep. John Katko of New York.
The President Next Door?
On Saturday, Sen. Klobuchar will celebrate her birthday in Des Moines, Iowa.
New Iowa polling from Change Research places Klobuchar at 2 percent, along with Presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Both Sen. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are at 24%, Pete Buttigieg is at 14%, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is at 12%, and Sen. Kamala Harris is at 10%. Beto O’Rourke came in at 5%. The poll’s margin of error is ±3.9%.
Also this week, Klobuchar became the 13th candidate to pledge to not accept donations from fossil fuel executives, companies and lobbyists.
The trend of hosting town halls on Fox News continues, but notably, The New York Times reported that Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s Fox Town Hall only drew 1.1 million viewers, 500,000 less than Klobuchar’s 1.6 million and less than half of Sen. Bernie Sander’s 2.5 million (good catch from Matt Pearce).
In other news
* Congress on Thursday was said to reach a deal with the White House on $19.1 billion in disaster relief for the U.S and Puerto Rico.
* The U.S. Department of Agriculture is moving researchers who cover the “effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps” in the Economic Research Service out of D.C., in what employees told Politico are part of “a political crackdown on economists whose assessments have raised questions about the president’s policies.” ERS employees voted to unionize earlier this month amidst the threats to move staff positions to other states.
* Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach , who was not selected to be the President’s “ Immigration Czar, ” provided a list of 10 conditions to the White House if he were to accept the position: “Access to a government jet 24 hours a day. An office in the West Wing, plus guaranteed weekends off for family time. And an assurance of being made secretary of homeland security by November.”
* Members of Democratic leadership attempted to push House Speaker Nancy Pelosi toward impeachment proceedings on Monday, something Pelosi still does not believe is the right course of action.
Quote of the week
“I love ska.” —Bill De Blasio, New York Mayor and Democratic Candidate for President
What I’m reading
The Washington Post: A conservative activist’s behind-the-scenes campaign to remake the nation’s courts.
A compelling deep dive on how untraceable money and media manipulation are being used to rebuild that nation’s courts under a partisan framework.
The Intercept/ICIJ : Thousands Of Immigrants Suffer In Solitary Confinement In ICE Detention
Despite directives that would suggest Immigration and Customs Enforcement do the opposite, an investigation found that ICE uses solitary confinement as a “go-to” to manage and punish immigrants for things as “minor as consensual kissing, and to segregate hunger strikers, LGBTQ detainees, and people with disabilities.”
New York Times: The Internet Security Apocalypse You Probably Missed
No description needed other than this except from NYT’s Sarah Jeong: “The Red Balloon team told us that an attacker could get into some routers and then take down, say, the entire New York Stock Exchange. I think that’s probably the nightmare scenario here.”
The Daily Beast: Inside the Secret Dinners Where Congress Figures Out How to Stop a Nuclear Apocalypse
Finally, on a lighter note, my predecessor (and fellow California exile) Sam Brodey has a story on where members of Congress go to chat about global annihilation and how to stop a potential nuclear apocalypse.

Texto completo: Un video que la fiscalía en Nueva York aún no presenta como parte de la evidencia en el juicio contra Keith Raniere muestra el martirio al que fueron sometidas mujeres convertidas en esclavas sexuales a través de la secta NXIVM en Albany.
En la grabación se aprecia el rito de iniciación mediante el cual “tatuaban” a las mujeres con las iniciales del líder de la secta.
En el clip, presentado en exclusiva en el noticiero de Loret de Mola de Televisa , se ve a un grupo de cuatro féminas desnudas en una de estas ceremonias.
Una de ellas está acostada mientras la tatúan; se trata de Sarah Edmondson , quien denunció en 2017 las prácticas de la secta a The New York Times.
A Raniere, que camuflaba los abusos como cursos de “autoayuda” bajo “Programas de Éxito Ejecutivo”, se le ve en el video pronunciando una especie de juramento que las mujeres a su vez deben repetir.
“Por favor márcame, sería un honor que quiero portar por el resto de mi vida”, se escucha en la ceremonia.
A pesar del dolor que se refleja en la cara de Edmondson al ser marcada a fuego vivo con un cauterizador, ésta intenta disimularlo y ríe junto a las otras chicas.

Bajo el sistema piramidal creado por Raniere en 2015, el grupo se conformó solo por mujeres. El acusado ocupaba la punta de la pirámide.
El alcance de este caso y el programa ESP (Executive, Success, Program), llegó a México con los nombres de Alejandro Bentancourt y Emiliano Salinas, hijo del expresidente Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
Otra mexicana mencionada como cercana de Raniere es Rosa Laura Junco , hija del presidente de Grupo Reforma.

Using the 'big lie' to delegitimize election results

Autor: Barone, Michael.

Texto completo: The "big lie" is back in style. Wikipedia tells us that the term was invented by Adolf Hitler to describe what other did — though he was the biggest liar of all. “The broad masses of a nation,” he wrote in Mein Kampf, “more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie.”
No one on the political scene in this country or any democratic nation is a monster comparable to Hitler. But some have resorted to the big lie in their attempts to override clear decisions of the people, at the risk of delegitimizing the nation’s democracy.
Exhibit A: The increasingly common claims that Democrats Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum “won” last fall’s elections for governor in Georgia and Florida. Actually, both of them lost by 50%-49% margins.
Abrams admits this, but insists that “so many people were disenfranchised and disengaged ... that I feel comfortable now saying, ‘I won.’” “Without voter suppression,” presidential candidate Kamala Harris told the Detroit NAACP, “Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia, Andrew Gillum is the governor of Florida.”
This is nonsense. Voter turnout was up 54% in Georgia and 38% in Florida over 2014 levels. And the “voter suppression” that people are complaining about was standard procedure, required by longstanding federal and state laws.
The suggestion that anything happened in Georgia or Florida tantamount to the voter suppression blacks experienced before the 1965 Voting Rights Act — suppression by unfair laws, threats of violence and murder — is preposterous. Perhaps Abrams hopes to convince the many blacks moving to Georgia that it’s run by white segregationists, or to discourage people from voting by making them think their vote won't count. But she and those who echo her charges are saying that America is moving backward on basic civil rights. That’s a big lie, one that stokes racial mistrust and hatred.
Exhibit B: The claims that Donald Trump and his 2016 campaign colluded with the Russians. Perhaps there was reason to believe this two or three years ago, from candidate Donald Trump’s refusals to condemn Vladimir Putin and from his proposed Moscow hotel. His behavior was downright weird in this regard, inviting all sorts of questions.
But the absurdity of much in the Steele dossier, and the fact that it was paid for by the Clinton campaign, should have sent up the early warning flags. The argument that a few Russian bot Facebook ads could have swung the election was always a flimsy one.
Even so, it was a rude shock to MSNBC and CNN viewers when Attorney General William Barr accurately reported that special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of Trump colluding with Russia.
Two months later, Democrats are still itching to impeach Trump on some pretext, and many want to rake over the cold coals once more to somehow get a flame going. But it’s apparent now that the collusion charges were a big lie, promoted by top Obama administration officials, who either deliberately or recklessly broke the rule that U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies ordinarily shouldn’t interfere in elections.
Exhibit C: Hop down to Australia, where contrary to polls and universal expectations, the center-right Liberal/National government last weekend beat the center-left Labor party. Voters’ rejection of Labor’s carbon tax to address climate change and its higher taxes on high earners and retirees particularly rankled the nation’s cosmopolitan commentators.
The big lie here was that modest-income voters — “trade workers, barmaids, cleaners and labourers,” in Quillette editor Clare Lehmann’s description — are voting irrationally, against their own short-term economic interest. Wasn’t Labor promising to funnel rich people’s money to them?
We hear the same condescending analyses from coastal critics of Rust Belt Trump voters and metropolitan London critics of British Brexit voters. How dare they not follow the guidance of their sophisticated superiors? They must be stupid or vicious, idiots or bigots.
The obvious reply is that these voters, like their critics who vote for politicians who promise to raise their taxes, value some things more than marginal short-term economic gain. They will cheerfully forgo short-term gains and prefer policies they believe are better in the long term for them and their country.
And they have some reason to discount the sophisticates’ expertise and to suspect their motives. The Bank of England predicted Brexit would wreck the economy. Instead, Britain is now growing at about the same rate as continental Europe — a bit faster if you look back a few quarters. The New York Times’ Paul Krugman predicted the stock market would fall “forever” after Donald Trump won. Has he checked his 401(k) lately?
From Atlanta to Adelaide, from the Steele dossier to the Brexit opponents, the big lie is being deployed in the service of delegitimizing the results of elections. But as one observer said, refusing to “respect the results” of an election is “threatening our democracy.” That was Hillary Clinton, tweeting on Oct. 21, 2016.

DeGeneres renews through 2022

Texto completo: Ellen DeGeneres announced Tuesday night that her multiple Emmy Award-winning daytime talk show has been renewed through 2022 for a total of 19 seasons.
"From the beginning I said that this show was going to be like a relationship," DeGeneres, 61, said in an online preview clip from the episode that airs Wednesday, adding ominously, "Sometimes in a relationship you need to take a break. But I don't," she quickly assured. "You're stuck with me because I just signed for three more years."
DeGeneres went on to say, "I really had no idea what this show was going to be when we started. I had gone through a tough time. I lost my career for a little while. This show was my second chance." She said viewer letters told her the show had "helped them go through chemo ... or watching the show made them laugh for the very first time in a long time."
Alongside the clip on social media she wrote, "Doing this show has been the ride of my life."
In a statement from the producers Wednesday, DeGeneres joked she had agreed to renew the show "because I love doing it so much every day, but also because that takes me to the end of my car lease."
In December, she told The New York Times she was considering ending the show when her recently extended contract ran out in summer 2020.

Texto completo: AIRLINES
American Cuts Extra Fees
For Some Large Items
Effective immediately, American Airlines will no longer charge passengers $ 150 to check sports equipment like bicycles or surfboards, or musical instruments like a cello. Such items, which were previously considered oversize baggage, will now be covered by the regular $ 30 fee for checked luggage, as long as the item weighs less than 50 pounds. And come winter, or if you're heading to the Southern Hemisphere, skiers will be able to include their skis and an equipment bag as a single item if the weight is below that limit.
"American has made it easier for musicians and athletes to travel with their gear, by eliminating certain fees that were previously imposed on oversize equipment," Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for the airline, said in a statement. The changes were based on customer and employee feedback.
American will continue to charge a $ 150 fee for certain specialty items, like scuba tanks and antlers, which have different handling requirements.
American's announcement isn't going to affect a huge portion of its travelers, and it's unlikely to be a sign of a bigger shift, at least not yet. Airlines still rely heavily on fees as a way to collect revenue while keeping ticket prices lower.
"More than anything else it is an early sign that American is shifting their public persona to be more friendly, said Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorksCompany, an airline revenue consultancy."
When it comes to what qualifies as oversize baggage, airlines do not share universal standards. For example, American now lets surfboards fly for free, and so does United Airlines-- if your itinerary starts or ends in California -- but Delta Air Lines still charges $ 150 to check one no matter where you're going.

BANKING
Laundering Software Hit
By Bug, Deutsche Says
Deutsche Bank acknowledged on Wednesday that it had used faulty software to screen customer transactions for suspicious activity, another blow to the lender's reputation as top executives prepare to face restive shareholders at its annual meeting.
Already under fire for lax money-laundering controls, the bank confirmed the essence of a report in Germany's Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that revealed software problems in its efforts to curb such activity. The bank maintained that no suspicious transactions had slipped through.
There is a movement among investors to vote on a measure expressing a lack of confidence in bank management at the annual meeting on Thursday. Paul Achleitner, the chairman, is expected to survive with the help of several influential shareholders, but he is likely to face pressure to step down before his term's scheduled end in 2022.
Deutsche Bank has faced repeated accusations that its lax scrutiny of customers made it a party to money laundering.
This week, The New York Times reported that anti-money-laundering specialists at the bank recommended in 2016 and 2017 that multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by Donald J. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be reported to a federal financial-crimewatchdog. But Deutsche Bank, which has lent billions of dollars to the entities controlled by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner, never filed such reports.
In November, prosecutors, federal agents, police officers and tax authorities searched Deutsche Bank headquarters in Frankfurt as part of an investigation into whether bank employees had helped customers use offshore tax havens to transfer money obtained illegally. JACK EWING

Texto completo: When Bruce Lee was handed his first pair of nunchucks in the mid-1960s, he called the weapon a "piece of junk," his training partner, Dan Inosanto, recalled recently.
Mr. Lee, the martial arts expert, said the nunchucks were not as effective as sticks -- too fancy and too showy.
"Then he goes, 'This might be good for the movies,"' Mr. Inosanto said in an interview.
It was a good bet. Wielding nunchucks with dizzying force, Mr. Lee vaulted to international fame. Americans flocked to martial arts.
But the popularity of nunchucks -- commonly, two rods connected by a chain or rope -- alarmed the authorities, in what many now see as a hysteria that echoed other racist fears of Asians. The police began arresting people for carrying what some called "deadly weapons." In four states, lawmakers banned them.
Now, decades later, those laws are being revisited.
This month, after more than 40 years on the books, Arizona's ban, which one lawmaker called "antiquated," was repealed. In December, a federal judge struck down New York's decades-long ban, saying it violated the Second Amendment, despite arguments from officials that the weapons were "dangerous and unusual."
Emboldened, martial artists are now eyeing the remaining state bans, in Massachusetts and California.
"A weapon can be anything from a rolled-up newspaper to a pool cue to a golf club, any kind of object that has a handle," Mr. Inosanto said. "To me it's kind of silly -- you would have to outlaw everything."
Rice thresher? Or horse bridle?
Modern-day disagreements over nunchucks -- or nunchaku, their more proper name -- are rooted in the weapon's origin on Okinawa, the Japanese island.
Records are incomplete, so many theories have emerged, said Mark T. McNally, a history professor at the University of Hawaii, who has written about Okinawan history.
Many, like Mr. Inosanto, believe that nunchaku were developed from an agricultural tool used to thresh rice.
That theory does not resonate in Okinawa today, Mr. McNally said. He said nunchaku were adapted from horses' headgear, a quick self-defense weapon that aristocrats could use to protect themselves from bandits.
"If you imagine kind of a bridle and a bit, and they would take it off and use it as a weapon," he said.
Panic spreads
In the mid-1960s, Mr. Lee used nunchaku in the American television series "The Green Hornet," playing the title character's assistant, Kato. In the 1972 film "Fist of Fury," Mr. Lee fends off more than a dozen assailants in a dojo with the weapon. They are also prominently featured in Mr. Lee's best-known film, 1973's "Enter the Dragon."
The popularity of nunchaku rose. Then awe turned to fear.
In 1973, The Morning News in Wilmington, Del., reported the arrest of a 15-year-old who was carrying the "concealed deadly weapon."
"Nunchakus are becoming a growing threat in American cities -- including Wilmington -- and police are gradually becoming enlightened," The Morning News reported.
A 1973 article in The New York Times reported nunchaku "turning up in the hands of youths in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego."
Sgt. Bob Martin of the Los Angeles Police Department told The Los Angeles Times that year: "We've made almost a dozen arrests in the last few weeks and we're still finding 12- and 13-year-old kids walking around with these thing sticking out of their pockets."
In October 1973, Newsweek used a new name for nunchaku: "killer sticks."
A month later, the California attorney general cited the Newsweek article when explaining that nunchaku can "generate 1,600 pounds of pressure at the point of impact, whereas the human bone breaks at about 8 1/2 pounds."
In 1974, the state banned their possession. (An exception was carved out to allow them inside martial arts studios, but it remains unclear how people can legally get them to or from the studios.) New York, Arizona and Massachusetts also enacted bans.
Terry Park, an Asian-American studies lecturer at the University of Maryland, who has taught about Asian-Americans in film, said the reaction to the popularity of nunchaku spoke to "latent anti-Asian anxieties" that have repeatedly played out in the United States.
"Just the name 'killer sticks' calls for the residues of yellow peril and how Asian-ness gets imagined in the U.S.," he said.
Revisiting the laws
After the hysteria faded, the bans' impact has been mixed.
Joseph Pollini, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, who served with the New York Police Department from 1969 to 2002, said that "somewhere between '69 and '75 was the last time I ever saw a nunchuck."
"It's just not a common weapon," he said.
Records do show, however, that nunchaku possession has regularly -- if not frequently -- been prosecuted. In 2002, a California appellate court upheld the conviction of a juvenile for nunchaku possession after the San Jose Police Department found plastic and foam nunchaku in his room while responding to a call of a possible threat, court records show.
The case that eventually overturned New York's ban started after a Verizon worker on a telephone pole outside a Nassau County man's home thought he was being threatened with a rifle. When the police responded, they found nunchaku in the home of the man, James M. Maloney. Mr. Maloney, a martial arts enthusiast, was charged by Nassau County prosecutors in 2000. The charge was dismissed three years later as part of a plea agreement, court records show.
Mr. Maloney then sued Nassau County officials in federal court, saying the ban violated the Second Amendment. The case dragged on for more than 15 years before the ban was struck down in December.
During the case, Nassau County officials said they had prosecuted three nunchaku possession cases from December 2014 to January 2017.
The bans also have commercial implications. Chris Pellitteri, the founder of the North American Nunchaku Association, said that nunchaku cannot be sold in California because of its ban.
"We have gun shows out here," he said. "They'll sell knives and bayonets and everything else, but you can't buy a pair of nunchucks."
The push to repeal in Arizona also came from a martial arts enthusiast: James Gowan, a state senator, a black belt in karate who teaches martial arts. Mr. Gowan did not answer phone calls and emails seeking comment.
At a hearing in February after the bill was introduced, Mr. Gowan called the law "antiquated."
"There was a type of urban legend that was put upon it that gang members had used it to commit crimes and things like that," he said.
Whether California or Massachusetts will follow New York and Arizona is yet to be seen. Mr. Pellitteri said he had received messages from lawyers seeking to replicate the success of New York's challenge.
Shaun Rundle, deputy director of the California Peace Officers' Association, said he questioned the wisdom of repealing the ban when data shows that overall assaults on law enforcement officers are rising.
As a former officer, Mr. Pollini said, he would not see someone carrying nunchaku as inherently threatening. Someone could always be charged with assault if they used nunchaku to attack another person. But he understood the sentiment put forth by Mr. Rundle.
"If you talk to a cop on the street," he said, "the less you allow someone to carry, the happier they're going to be because it's less likely they're going to get hurt with it."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: TOKYO -- By now, President Trump and Japan's prime minister are on a first-name basis.
But that could soon become more complicated. In Japan, a first name means something different: The Japanese refer to themselves with the surname first, then the given name. And Japan's foreign minister says it is time for the Western world to respect his country's tradition and render Japanese names in that order in English.
So the man Westerners know as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would be called Abe Shinzo.
The foreign minister, Taro Kono (or Kono Taro, if you please), issued his request to foreign media outlets during a news conference on Tuesday.
"As many news organizations write Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Moon Jae-in," Mr. Kono said, noting that the surname-first template was followed for other Asian leaders, "it is desirable for Prime Minister Abe Shinzo's name to be written in a similar manner."
Since opening to the West a century and a half ago, the Japanese have accepted that Westerners would refer to them not as they refer to themselves -- surname first, then given name -- but in reverse order.
On their business cards -- the exchange of which is a crucial part of commercial etiquette -- many in Japan have their name printed surname first in Japanese on one side and given-name first in English on the other.
But Mr. Kono suggested it would be a good time for news organizations to rethink their practices, because Mr. Trump is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on Saturday for a state visit, and a Group of 20 summit meeting will be held in Osaka next month.
The Summer Olympics will also be held in Tokyo next year, and Mr. Kono said that the names of Japanese athletes should appear surname-first in video footage, just as the names of athletes from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and North Korea do.
The foreign minister's request comes at a time when the Japanese government is simultaneously nurturing a revival of nationalism and spearheading an effort to draw in more foreigners as the native Japanese population wanes.
Mr. Abe is strongly supported by the far right wing of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which hews to tradition and tends toward insularity.
But he has prioritized foreign policy and worked to elevate Japan as an international leader, and he has also nudged the country toward more openness, pushing the passage of a law late last year that authorized a sharp increase in the number of foreign workers who will be admitted to Japan.
Globally minded Japanese say that as the United States under Mr. Trump re-evaluates its role as the champion of a democratic world order, Japan should not do anything that appears to be a retreat from the international community.
"What I think is negative is a subliminal message that a change itself can send," said Nobuko Kobayashi, a partner in Tokyo with the Japanese arm of Ernst & Young, the consulting firm.
If Japan insists that Westerners revert to the traditional name-ordering convention, she said, some might view that as Japan "withdrawing from the Western world, and that is precisely not the message we want to send."
Ms. Kobayashi, who graduated from the elite Tokyo University and has a graduate degree from Harvard Business School, said that ever since Japan opened to the West in the 19th century, its people had become adept at incorporating Western customs.
Reversing name order in different contexts is "a demonstration that Japanese culture is a flexible one," she said. "As Japanese are comfortable using forks and knives when they eat Western food, they are also very comfortable using chopsticks" when they eat Japanese meals.
It is not clear what Mr. Abe thinks of Mr. Kono's proposal. He has not commented, although his chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters that given the long-established practice of putting the surname last in Western contexts, "we need to consider many elements" before making a government recommendation.
Japan's education minister, Masahiko Shibayama, endorsed Mr. Kono's proposal, which echoes a similar recommendation nearly two decades ago from the government's National Language Council, which adjudicates various linguistic issues. Shortly after the advisory was issued in 2000, the Education Ministry overhauled textbooks for junior high school English-language classes, putting Japanese names in surname-first order. Foreign media, however, did not follow.
On Twitter, some critics ribbed Mr. Shibayama, pointing out that his name was listed on the Education Ministry's English-language website as "Masahiko Shibayama" -- an example of the huge undertaking that would be required to institute the change across the government. Mr. Shibayama changed the order of his name on Tuesday.
Kumiko Torikai, a retired professor of English education and cross-cultural communication at Rikkyo University, said that the historic adoption of the Western name order was "insulting" to Japanese tradition. "The major trend in the world is to accept a multicultural society," she said. "It's normal that various cultures coexist and each should respect other cultures. I think it's outdated just to copy Western countries."
In South Korea, the government issued official guidance before the 2012 London Olympics requesting that transliterations of its athletes' names be rendered in the traditional cultural style of surname first.
"Each Korean and each name of a Korean may seem like a small thing," the guidance read, "but when they come together, they form the national image of the Republic of Korea."
However, even those who support the idea of respecting cultural naming tradition say it is not practical to reverse entrenched practices.
"I do see the point in a way, but I think it's also a futile exercise and likely to contribute to confusion," said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. "It's naïve for the Japanese government to think that it can get the international media and beyond to switch overnight."
(The New York Times generally writes Chinese and Korean names with surname first, while using the Western order for Japanese names -- although its general policy is to render people's names the way they prefer.)
Some in the Japanese establishment say that Japan should not necessarily invoke China or South Korea. "I think we opened up rather earlier than them," said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to the United States, referring to Japan's opening to the West with the arrival of the American Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853.
Reversing the convention now, said Sachiko Ishikawa, who works as a translator in Tokyo, would be "taking a step backward in time." Ms. Ishikawa, whose mother is German and father is Japanese, said she was concerned that the proposal was motivated more by politics than cultural respect.
"In my opinion, there is an unnerving wave of nationalism growing in Japan -- and to be honest, I think this is a small symptom of a much bigger problem," Ms. Ishikawa said. "The world is shifting toward right-wing ideologies, so it's obvious that this isn't so much about how to write about P.M. Abe, but rather a sloppy way to establish their nationalistic sentiments and demands overseas."
Perhaps a hint of Mr. Abe's views will emerge during Mr. Trump's visit. When the American president came to Japan in November 2017, Mr. Abe gave him hats emblazoned with the slogan "Donald and Shinzo make alliance even greater." If the hats say "Abe" this time, we'll know.

Boston group brings corporate America to D.C. to push for climate bill

Texto completo: Members of Congress are used to hearing from the usual suspects — the enviros and other lefties — about the pressing need for a law that would curb carbon emissions.
But corporate America has joined the crusade. It will be tougher for lawmakers to write off or refuse to meet with the companies who employ their constituents.
Witness the lobbying blitz underway in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. Ceres, the Boston-based environmental nonprofit, corralled executives from some 75 or so companies across the country to schlep to D.C. and make the case for a climate change bill. In particular, these business-world emissaries want a price put on carbon pollution — potentially through a straightforward tax, or a program for capping and trading emissions allowances. Ceres and its allies aren't backing one particular solution over another. Their goal: to create a financial incentive that puts the entire US economy to work in the fight against global warming.
Ceres has embarked on similar efforts in the past. But Ceres lobbyists say this initiative, dubbed “LEAD on Carbon Pricing," is the largest so far — in terms of the number of companies involved and the scope of industries at the table. They say every state is represented in some way. Who's on board? We have tech (Salesforce, Wayfair, Autodesk), consumer goods (Unilever, Mondelez, Pepsi), energy (National Grid, Exelon, PG&E), to name just a few.
Tim Smith of Walden Asset Management joined Ceres on these forays before. (His Boston firm specializes in socially responsible investing, including in companies that pay attention to their environmental footprints.) But a corporate coalition this diverse represents a different kind of voice. Self-interest, no surprise, is a motivating factor. Many big companies want to do the right thing, he says, but they also want to make sure their rivals play by the same rules.
Smith knows carbon pricing still has plenty of critics in Congress. His side needs to build more comfort among Republicans that this isn't just a Democratic issue. It's why he made a point of holding most of his meetings this time around with skeptics, not believers.
For some businesses, the ravages of climate change have become too difficult to ignore. It's no surprise to see PG&E on the list of Ceres supporters. The California utility, besieged by deadly fires, could be the first major corporate bankruptcy attributed to a warming planet. But it probably won't be the last.
The skiing industry is also feeling the heat, as the snowpack slowly melts away. Jessyca Keeler of Ski NH, the New Hampshire trade group, trekked to Washington after getting an invite from the National Ski Areas Association. New Hampshire's ski resorts have invested $20 million in the past five years to improve the efficiency of their snow-making machines, she says. But Keeler says more must be done. While the resort owners don't endorse a particular bill, she says they recognize that putting a price on carbon is the most cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions in a way that's relevant to reaching global climate goals.
Ceres lobbyists say the businesses are spurred in part by recent studies, including one from several agencies within the Trump administration, that underscore the growing risks of global warming. But they'll need more to join the cause, to persuade the naysayers in Congress. They don't want a repeat of the Waxman-Markey failure nearly a decade ago, when a 1,400-page climate change bill died in the Senate after narrowly passing in the House. (Cosponsor Ed Markey recently resumed the fight by championing the “Green New Deal" manifesto.)  
Ceres's crusade this week highlights the Boston group's growing clout in the business community, something that could prove crucial to getting a climate bill done. Corporate America is knocking now. Maybe Congress will listen more closely.

As Joko Is Re-elected, Indonesia Bucks Trend To Install Strongmen

Texto completo: MANDALIKA, Indonesia -- The woman threw herself on the road in front of the motorcade, forcing the vehicle with the license plate "Indonesia 1" to slam on the brakes.
"Jokowi, I love you," she cried, as President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, re-elected with the release of Tuesday's vote count, rolled down his window to clasp hands with the sobbing fan on a rural roadside on the island of Lombok.
Commonly known by the nickname Jokowi, Mr. Joko seems an unlikely figure to command such rock-star reverence. His oratory depends less on grand vision or populist rhetoric and more on statistics about road building or village financing down to the 10th decimal place.
He favors plain white collared shirts and black trousers. He speaks softly.
Yet Mr. Joko's re-election to a second and final term as president of the world's fourth most populous nation is a powerful counterweight to the democratic weakening and strongman politics that have recently dominated the global electoral landscape.
"I'm president of all of Indonesia, and democracy protects pluralism," Mr. Joko told The New York Times in an interview. "My government is about harmony and opposing extremism."
Just by the numbers, of which Mr. Joko is so fond, Indonesia is a nation of political superlatives. The country has the world's largest Muslim population, but it is also a secular state with sizable religious minorities. It is the planet's third-biggest democracy, behind India and the United States.
And it is the biggest island nation on earth, composed of 17,000 islands where more than 300 languages are spoken, according to the president's count.
"For the continued existence of our country," Mr. Joko said, "we have to rely on Indonesia's culture, which is diverse and tolerant."
Yet the challenges of holding together such a sprawling nation mean that Indonesia often seems to retreat into itself rather than project its weight on the global stage. Mr. Joko, 57, demurred when asked whether Indonesia, which overthrew a dictatorship two decades ago, might serve as a model for Muslim-majority nations ruled by family diktat.
"Islam and democracy are compatible," Mr. Joko said. "But let others come and see with their own eyes. I cannot tell them."
Instead, he began listing the finer points of cutting red tape to acquire business permits. Focusing on a lagging infrastructure that has hobbled the nation's economic growth, he spent nearly 10 minutes talking about the more than 1,100 miles of new roads built during his first five-year term.
Then he moved on to the merits of mass transit. The country's traffic-choked capital, Jakarta, struggled for years to build a subway, its first part opening only recently.
"Transportation maybe is not sexy," he said. "But if we don't have good infrastructure, we cannot be a developed country. We are behind in building roads and airports."
[Jakarta is sinking so fast, it could end up underwater.]
A onetime furniture maker before becoming a mayor, Mr. Joko is the first true commoner to be elected president of Indonesia. He took power in 2014, promising to uphold the rights of minorities and women. In addition to improving Indonesia's woeful infrastructure, he pledged to combat deep-rooted corruption.
"I've been working on public works for 40 years," said Basuki Hadimuljono, the minister for public works and people's housing. "This is the first time we've had commitment from the president to do all this."
Mr. Joko's opponent in last month's elections, Prabowo Subianto, was the same old-guard opponent he faced in 2014. A former army general who was once married to the daughter of Indonesia's longtime dictator, Mr. Prabowo said on Tuesday that he would challenge the election results.
Despite his taste for wine and a Christian mother, Mr. Prabowo aligned himself with hard-line Muslim forces that have called for the country to jettison its syncretic Islam for a more austere form of the faith as practiced in its Middle Eastern birthplace. He allowed rumors to flourish that Mr. Joko, who fasts twice a week in a pious Muslim tradition, was a closet Christian.
Mr. Joko has defended Indonesian Muslim traditions, which incorporate elements from other faiths, including local nature worship. As president, he banned a hard-line group intent on creating a global Islamic caliphate to replace democratic governance.
"Our Islam is modern, moderate and different from others," he said.
But as Indonesia has hewed to a global trend of growing Islamic conservatism, Mr. Joko picked as his running mate this election a Muslim cleric who has spoken out against yoga and gay rights.
When his former political protégé, an ethnic Chinese Christian, was imprisoned for blasphemy in 2017, a charge that human rights activists saw as politically motivated, Mr. Joko declined to defend him.
Asked about his failure to speak up for his old political ally, Mr. Joko said after a long pause, "Sometimes in politics, it's difficult to say," adding, "You must decide the priorities for the country."
Mr. Joko's critics say his silence betrayed the religious minorities who overwhelmingly voted for him in both presidential elections.
"I thought that Jokowi missed the golden moment to strengthen the human rights regime that has been enshrined in the Constitution and other human rights laws," said Nursyahbani Katjasungkana, a human rights lawyer and women's rights advocate.
Mr. Joko's supporters say that his second term will allow him to pursue a reformist agenda without having to worry about re-election because of term limits.
And in a country where political elites are often dogged by whispers of lavish corruption, Mr. Joko's family is ascetic. One of his sons is a blogger who dabbles in a business of treats made of banana, while the other owns a pancake chain. His daughter failed to pass the civil service exam. Mr. Joko has only one wife.
He enjoys heavy metal, and once traveled to Singapore for a Judas Priest concert.
In a Muslim-dominated society, Mr. Joko has called for greater female participation in the work force. Eight of his 34 ministers are women, and they handle important portfolios like the foreign and finance ministries.
"It's very important for our economy to empower women," Mr. Joko said.
Walking through a food market on the tourist island of Bali last weekend, Mr. Joko noted that more than 90 percent of the stall owners were female. He talked up microfinancing initiatives for women.
The market was spotless. Hillocks of guavas, avocados and hairy rambutan fruit were perfectly placed. A few years ago, the space was filthy, slick with fish guts and rotting produce underfoot, stall owners said.
This year, Bali banned the use of single-use plastics, like plastic bags and straws, to tackle the tsunami of waste washing up on Indonesia's once pristine beaches. The country is the second-largest producer of plastic waste in the world.
Mr. Joko bought a pair of papayas from Made Warti, a 68-year-old fruit seller. Delighted that the president had stopped at her stand, she tried to stuff the fruit in a plastic bag before a member of the presidential entourage instructed her to use a cloth tote.
She shrugged when asked about government initiatives for female entrepreneurs like herself; she had never heard of such a thing.
In a country as scattered and corrupt as Indonesia, much can get lost between the highest levels of government policy and a shopkeeper trying to make a living.
The crowds jostled Mr. Joko as he caressed fruit and posed for a seemingly endless procession of selfies. The day before, he had spent hours in a mall and other venues doing the same. Smile, smile, smile.
Sometimes, his admirers were so nervous that their sweaty fingers could not activate the buttons to trigger their phone cameras. Mr. Joko was happy to take over the controls.
"I'm your president so I work for you," he joked as one fan handed over his cellphone. "That's my job."

Cohen says he was told to make false Moscow claim

Texto completo: Michael Cohen, the former longtime personal attorney for President Trump, told a House panel during closed-door hearings earlier this year that he had been instructed by Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow to falsely claim in a 2017 statement to Congress that negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow ended in January 2016, according to people familiar with his testimony.
In fact, Cohen later said discussions on the Moscow tower continued into June of the presidential election year, after it was clear that Trump would be the GOP nominee. Cohen is serving three years in prison for lying to Congress, financial crimes, and campaign finance violations.
House Democrats are now scrutinizing whether Sekulow or other Trump attorneys played a role in shaping Cohen's 2017 testimony to Congress. Cohen has said he made the false statement to help hide the fact that Trump had potentially hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in a possible Russian project while he was running for president.
"We're trying to find out whether anyone participated in the false testimony that Cohen gave to this committee," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in an interview. He did not comment on who, if anyone, might have instructed Cohen to lie.
Jane Serene Raskin and Patrick Strawbridge, attorneys for Sekulow, said in a statement that "Cohen's alleged statements are more of the same from him and confirm the observations of prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that Cohen's 'instinct to blame others is strong.' "
"That this or any Committee would rely on the word of Michael Cohen for any purpose — much less to try and pierce the attorney-client privilege and discover confidential communications of four respected lawyers — defies logic, well-established law and common sense," they added.
Cohen's assertions about Sekulow are laid out in transcripts of his February and March appearances before the House intelligence panel that could be released as soon as Monday evening.

Would-be Trump aide seeks jet, cabinet post, and more
Access to a government jet 24 hours a day. An office in the West Wing, plus guaranteed weekends off for family time. And an assurance of being made secretary of homeland security by November.
Those were among a list of 10 conditions that Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, has given to the White House if he is to become the administration's “immigration czar," a job President Trump has been looking to create to coordinate immigration policy across government agencies. The list was described by three people familiar with it.
Mr. Kobach, who once served as an adviser to the hard-line immigration Sheriff Joe Arpaio and helped write an Arizona law requiring local officials to verify the citizenship of anyone they had “reasonable suspicion" to believe was an unauthorized immigrant, said he would need to be the main television spokesman for the Trump administration on immigration policy. And he said he wanted a guarantee that cabinet secretaries whose portfolios relate to immigration would defer to him, with the president mediating disputes if need be.
The list was submitted by Mr. Kobach in recent weeks as he discussed his interest in the job. Other conditions included having a staff of seven reporting to him, “walk in" privileges to the Oval Office, a security detail if deemed necessary and the title of assistant to the president.
He would need access to the jet, he said, for weekly visits to the border and travel back to Kansas on the weekends. The existence of the list has become known among officials in the Trump administration, some of whom were taken aback by what they regard as its presumptuousness.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the list. Mr. Kobach did not respond to e-mails and text messages seeking comment.
Mr. Kobach, a graduate of Harvard, Oxford, and Yale Law School, served as Kansas's secretary of state from 2011 until January.

Officials: DeVos personal e-mail use for work 'limited'
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has sometimes used her personal e-mail accounts for government business and has not always properly saved the messages, according to an internal investigation released Monday.
The agency's Office of Inspector General, which was investigating at the request of House Democrats, said it searched the department's e-mail system and found a "limited" number of messages to or from DeVos's personal accounts. In total, it said there were "fewer than 100" e-mails linked to four personal accounts.
Most of the e-mails were from the first six months of 2017, soon after DeVos took office, and most were from a single person, the inquiry found. The person, who was not identified in the report, was writing to recommend candidates for agency jobs. Other e-mails were from people who congratulated DeVos on her confirmation or offered other job advice.
In total, investigators said they identified six e-mails sent by DeVos on private accounts, including five that involved official agency business. The inquiry concluded that there was no evidence of "active or extensive" use of DeVos's personal accounts.
The secretary's office told investigators it was taking "additional steps to identify and preserve" e-mails in her personal accounts. A department spokeswoman declined to comment for this story.
Under department rules, employees are forbidden from using personal e-mails for government business except in rare circumstances when their work accounts are unavailable. In those cases, employees are required to forward the messages to their work accounts within 20 days. But in DeVos's case, the report said, that never happened.
During his 2016 campaign, President Trump repeatedly attacked Democratic rival Hillary Clinton over findings that she used a private e-mail server for work while she was secretary of state. Associated Press
Trump wants inquiry into Biden family, China ties
President Trump on Sunday night called for an investigation into financial ties between China and the family of Joe Biden, the former vice president and current front-runner in a crowded Democratic field of presidential hopefuls, and the candidate Trump's advisers believe could pose the biggest potential threat to his re-election in 2020.
“One hundred percent — it's a disgrace," Trump said in an interview with Steve Hilton, a Fox News host, when asked whether the Biden family's supposed financial ties with China should be investigated. “And then he says China's not a competitor of ours," he added. “China is a massive competitor of ours. They want to take over the world."
The accusation of financial ties was made by the conservative author Peter Schweizer, who claimed that Biden's younger son, Hunter, made millions from the Chinese government at a time when his father was negotiating with Chinese officials over government issues. Schweizer was also the author of “Clinton Cash," which looked at donations to the Clinton Foundation made by foreign entities, and was bankrolled in part by the family of Robert Mercer, the wealthy conservative donor.
The Bidens have denied the charge.
It was not the first time that Trump has threatened investigations of his political enemies, raising questions from his critics about whether he is abusing his position as president. Some of those threats were revealed by the special counsel's report. Others, Trump has made in public.
His favorite target — dating to the 2016 campaign — has been Hillary Clinton, whose name generated chants of “lock her up" at Trump rallies. In 2017, the president asked Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, to order the prosecution of Clinton, according to the special counsel's report.

Piden “luz verde” para licencias de conducir a indocumentados en Nueva York

Texto completo: Crece la presión para que la legislatura de Nueva York avance el programa que entregaría licencias de conducción a indocumentados en todo el estado.
Una coalición de inmigrantes y activistas se manifestó este martes en Albany, sede del Gobierno del estado de Nueva York, para pedir que se apruebe este vital proyecto de ley.
La propuesta de ley, presentada por el asambleísta Marcos Crespo y el senador Luis Sepúlveda, está a la espera de recibir el respaldo de las dos cámaras legislativas, cuya sesión finaliza a mediados de junio, lo que preocupa a los inmigrantes que dependen de un coche para trabajar o desplazarse.
“Las licencias de conducir son necesarias para familias como la mía. En Long Island y a través del estado hay áreas donde conducir se convierte en la única opción porque no podemos confiar en el sistema público de transporte para ir al trabajo o llevar a nuestros niños a sus citas médicas”, aseguró Silvia García, residente de Long Island y miembro de la organización proinmigrante Se Hace Camino Nueva York.
“Los inmigrantes de Nueva York han esperado por mucho tiempo, necesitamos que la legislatura del estado tome acción ahora”, afirmó García en un comunicado de la “Coalición Luz Verde” que convocó la protesta de hoy.
Doce estados, Puerto Rico y el distrito de Columbia ya han otorgado licencias de conducir a indocumentados.
Para el asambleísta Crespo, el tiempo para restaurar el privilegio de conducir a los residentes que no son ciudadanos “es ahora”, dijo Crespo en referencia a que los indocumentados podían conducir en este estado.
Pero, en el 2002, un año después de los atentados terroristas del 11S, el gobernador George Pataki impuso el requisito de presentar el documento del seguro social para sacar o mantener la licencia de conducir, lo que llevó a que miles perdieran el permiso.
“Esta legislación hará las carreteras más seguras para todos los neoyorquinos. Además aumentará significativamente los ingresos para nuestro estado y reducirá el coste del seguro (de los coches) para todos los conductores” , afirmó.
Aunque resta poco tiempo para que concluya la sesión legislativa, antes de que comience el periodo de vacaciones, aún no hay fecha para votar el proyecto ni el gobernador Andrew Cuomo ha pedido a los legisladores que lo incluyan en la agenda.
Por su parte, el senador Sepúlveda aseguró que el proyecto de ley es “sin lugar a dudas una de las cosas correctas que hay que hacer para Nueva York, con carreteras más seguras, comunidades más fuertes y más unidas y un auge económico”.
Destacó que los inmigrantes indocumentados aportan más de mil millones de dólares al año a la economía del estado y que de aprobarse el proyecto, esa cantidad aumentará con la creación de más empleos, mejores salarios y millones de dólares en ingresos locales y estatales.
En un editorial el pasado abril, el periódico New York Times apoyó la legislación y destacó que se calcula que en Nueva York viven 750,000 indocumentados, lo que suponía más del 5 % de la fuerza trabajadora del estado en 201 6, de acuerdo con el Pew Research Center.

'Jeopardy!' champ James Holzhauer wins again for the 23rd time, pushing winnings to $1.7M

Texto completo: James Holzhauer, the current reigning champ of "Jeopardy!," returned to the quiz show Monday night – and won his 23rd consecutive game.
Holzhauer, 34, a professional Las Vegas sports gambler, was back to defend his title after the popular game show took a break in its regular competition for a two-week Teachers Tournament.
He won $89,229, pushing his total winnings to $1,780,237.
Before Monday's win, Holzhauer had accumulated winnings of $1,691,008 in 22 victories going back to his first appearance on April 4.
So far, he's the second-most successful contestant in the game show's history, holding the number two spots on the lists for regular-season cash winnings and consecutive wins.
He trails only Ken Jennings, who remains in the top spot for both lists: 74 victories and $2,520,700 in prize money.
How is Holzhauer racking up such big winnings? He explained his strategy in a Q&A with The New York Times. Unlike most players, he picks the highest-value clues first.
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game, I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said, likening his approach to a poker strategy. "There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament. You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Also, he seems to have highly tuned hand-eye coordination when it comes to reaching for the buzzer.
Eddie Timanus, a five-time "Jeopardy!" winner who compiles the college coaches polls for USA TODAY Sports, describes Holzhauer as "a game-changer," both for his aggressive bidding and his mastery of the signalling buzzer.
"Thanks to his ability to ring in first consistently and rarely miss, he usually has a considerable total built up by the time he uncovers a Daily Double," Timanus says. "He finds most of them since he’s able to maintain control of the board for long stretches, and, as we've seen, he's not afraid to bet big. "
Meanwhile, USA TODAY's For the Win has done the math: How quickly can Holzhauer reach Jennings on the money list?
He’s averaged $76,864 per win so if he keeps up that pace, it’ll take him between 10 or 11 victories to reach Jennings, or about two weeks’ worth of games, says For the Win.
Easy-peasy.
"Jeopardy!" and host Alex Trebek are celebrating their 35th anniversary season. With a weekly audience of 23 million viewers, it's the top-rated quiz show on television.

The case for creating an ‘individual reparations account'

Texto completo: For the Monitor
In 2008 and 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate made a formal apology to the African American community for “centuries of brutal dehumanization and injustices.”
Plus, there was an admission that “African Americans continue to suffer from the complex interplay between slavery and Jim Crow long after both systems were formally abolished through enormous damage and loss, both tangible and intangible, including the loss of human dignity.”
Since then, no consequential actions have been taken by the federal government to make amends for these wrongs. That's where you and I come in.
An “individual reparations account” is an amount of money you set aside each year, no paperwork involved. You are dedicating the funds to making reparation.
You decide the amount: $25? $25,000? You can contribute, for example, to racial justice organizations led by black people, such as Black Lives Matter, Color of Change or the NAACP. You can support black political candidates. Hire black staff. Donate a full or partial scholarship for a black student (for example, the United Negro College Fund). Send black kids to summer camp (Fresh Air Fund).
As Michael Eric Dyson, professor of sociology at Georgetown University and originator of the IRA concept, said: “Even though your ancestors didn't own slaves, surely you can see the justice of making reparation, even if you can't make it happen politically. Your white privilege has not been hampered by that fact. Black sweat built the country you now reside in, and you continue to enjoy the fruits of that labor.”
As a white person, I have benefited from white privilege. For example, my parents got a low mortgage FHA loan in the 1950s to buy a $20,000 home and later sold it for $180,000. Part of that $160,000 profit became my inheritance. Black people were excluded from the FHA program, part of the G.I. Bill, and that's one reason subsequent generations have significantly less wealth.
On average, in 2019 white households have 6.5 times the wealth of black households.
With this differential, isn't it only fair that restitution be made? You and I, in a small but important way, can make amends for 400 years of white supremacy, institutionalized racism and brutal acts against black people, that often lead to death or a lifetime of trauma.
“Slavery,” says David Brooks of the New York Times, “doesn't merely cause pain and suffering in the slave. It is a corruption that infects the whole society. It is a collective debt that will have to be paid.”
So, commit to establishing an individual reparations account today. I believe it's the best white people can do, especially in the absence of a comprehensive government reparations program for African Americans.

Texto completo: BUDAPEST -- Facing a floor-to-ceiling window that offered sweeping views of the Danube, the river that flows through 10 European countries, Aleksander Ceferin paused for a moment to consider his words.
Ceferin, a Slovenian lawyer elected in February to a second term as the leader of UEFA, European soccer's governing body, has become accustomed to carefully tempering his comments, to steering clear of trouble in whatever he chooses to say publicly, but this month he knows his every word will be parsed even more than usual.
In the past week alone, UEFA has found itself fighting fires on three fronts. First, there was criticism of a behind-the-scenes effort to reshape the Champions League, club soccer's most important competition and UEFA's financial engine, by effectively excluding most of Europe from the tournament. Then came anger from England over the choice of Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, as the host of next week's Europa League final. But the loudest fury arrived on Monday, when the newly crowned English champion Manchester City learned, through a report by The New York Times, that it could be facing a Champions League ban related to an investigation into its finances.
Each problem sat squarely on the desk of Ceferin last week in his temporary office, a converted suite in a luxury hotel in Budapest. And each will test his ability to balance the competing interests of rich clubs and small leagues, to defend his integrity amid serious accusations from powerful interests, and to navigate a difficult moment for European soccer in which some are questioning UEFA's ability -- and even its willingness -- to enforce its rules.
"Sometimes," Ceferin said, "we forget how dirty this industry is."
Ceferin, 51, is still relatively new to this world. The former president of Slovenia's soccer federation, he emerged from obscurity to become one of the most powerful men in sports after a scandal removed his predecessor, Michel Platini, from office in 2015. Now three years into the job, Ceferin is facing perhaps the most crucial period of his tenure, and he knows the decisions he and UEFA soon will take could define the future of the European game for a generation or more.
The Champions League is perhaps the most significant issue, since the plan put forward earlier this month -- proposed and favored by a group of the biggest clubs from the richest leagues -- could upend an already-frayed ecosystem in which resource-poor clubs risk being pushed further to the margins, and all but excluded from the continent's elite tournaments.
The plans leaked after a meeting Ceferin and his executive committee held with a group representing Europe's domestic leagues. The leagues denounced the plan, with the most vocal of their leaders, Javier Tebas of the Spain's La Liga, darkly suggesting that UEFA had no interest in listening to stakeholders beyond a small cartel of top clubs.
Tebas's reaction, according to Ceferin, was designed to stoke public anger. If so, it worked. Fans and commentators almost immediately took to social media to reject the proposal. Ceferin likened some of the loudest voices to a new breed of politicians who stoke anger to fuel their movements.
"Look," he said, "one way of operating is shouting, 'The rich will take everything!' And this is typical of the populist shouting in European politics."
"He's loud," Ceferin added of Tebas. "I think it's part of his tactics to operate like that. But I don't think it's very productive."
Neither Tebas nor anyone else, he noted, had proposed an alternative. And anyway, Ceferin insisted, nothing has been decided yet -- except for the fact that matches in European competitions will not be played on the weekends, a guarantee that was announced Friday. The bigger clubs had sought those windows to maximize the attractiveness and value of Champions League games to broadcasters, even if it threatened to severely damage the marketability, and perhaps even the viability, of domestic leagues.
Ceferin was elected on a platform that championed support for Europe's small- and medium-sized soccer nations, regions that have seen the power of their clubs eroded by the ubiquitous popularity of a handful of top teams and leagues whose televised matches are often more popular than the in-person domestic alternative. That influence is the real imbalance, Ceferin said.
While UEFA, which pays $ 240 million each year to Europe's national leagues in so-called solidarity payments, the continent's behemoths -- the Premier League, Bundesliga and La Liga -- pay nothing to their continental counterparts. Ceferin suggested that must change.
"Solidarity means not only solidarity from the UEFA's side, but also the Big Five leagues who sell rights to the small countries and affect directly the revenues of the local leagues," he said.
With so much at stake, and opponents circling, Ceferin's personal conduct -- particularly his close friendship with the Juventus president Andrea Agnelli, who helped draw up the Champions League restructuring plan -- has come under scrutiny.
He says that he has heard the stories about how Agnelli arranged for Ceferin to take a spin in a Ferrari (Ceferin said that he has never sat in one); about the private jet trips on the Italian's plane (they have never even flown commercial together, Ceferin said); and even the whispers about the motivation behind Agnelli's decision to choose Ceferin to be the godfather to his six-month old daughter (Ceferin called it an "honor," one that transcended soccer).
Still, the close relationship between the men and their families and his decision to accept Agnelli's offer to serve as godfather at such a delicate time professionally has raised eyebrows in soccer circles, given the high stakes of the Champions League negotiations, with several officials privately raising the issue in recent weeks.
"Those rumors in football that are shared all the time are so illogical, and so stupid," he added. "One day it is Agnelli is important, and he can influence everything because of my personal friendship with him. Next day P.S.G. is, because they are buying are rights. Then the third day we help only Real Madrid, and that's why they were four times in the final."
Meting out potential punishment to Manchester City is a different, and potentially more serious, problem for Ceferin and UEFA. City, a global billboard of sorts for the ruling family of Abu Dhabi, has vowed to defend itself to the bitter end in the face of a potential Champions League ban. If it succeeds in avoiding punishment, as Qatari-owned P.S.G. has done while facing similar accusations of violating financial controls, that could alter the balance of power in European soccer in an era of nation-state club owners.
Ceferin said he would not comment on the case while it is continuing, and besides, he added, it's in the hands of an independent panel whose work he has no control over. But he rejected the suggestion that UEFA would shy away from sanctioning any club, whether it was an exceedingly wealthy one like Manchester City or a rich and well-connected one like P.S.G., whose chairman, Nasser el-Khelaifi, sits on UEFA's executive committee at the same time he controls the organization's broadcast partner beIN Sports.
"If you do it right, you don't sell yourself, if you are not involved in any strange business, if you are not corrupted, then you go straight forward and be fair to anyone," Ceferin said.

Texto completo: Headnote Provision drastically raises costs on so-called unearned income for children with assets, young adults in school
WASHINGTON - A little-noticed provision in President Donald Trump's sprawling new tax law is treating middle- and low-income college students as if they are trust-fund babies, taxing sizable financial aid packages at a rate first established 33 years ago to prevent wealthy parents from funneling money to their children to lower their tax burdens.
Higher-education leaders are calling on Congress to fix the provision, which drastically raised the tax rate on so-called unearned income for children with assets and young adults in school. Students with large financial aid packages are finding their nontuition assistance for items such as room and board taxed by as much as 37%, even if their family income tax rates are much lower.
The impact on full-time undergraduate and graduate students younger than 24 went largely unnoticed until the waning weeks of tax season. But word is spreading. About 1.3 million undergraduate students and 15,000 graduate students have scholarships and grant aid that cover non-tuition expenses.
Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, a Washington trade group representing 1,700 college and university presidents, wrote to Democratic and Republican leaders of the tax-writing House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees, urging them to "swiftly correct a mistake."
Mitchell wrote that the portion of college scholarships subject to the tax is usually awarded to students from families of little means. Among those students are college athletes awarded full scholarships, many of whom come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
"Now, those students are being taxed at the same rate as wealthy individuals," Mitchell wrote.
The so-called kiddie tax rate was established specifically to address generational transfers used by rich parents to lower their tax burdens, but in the name of tax-code simplification, the Republican tax law expanded its reach. It is now hitting tribal funds dispensed to Native American children and young adults, and the families of service members who died in combat, some of whom saw hefty tax bills for their children's survivor benefits this past spring.
A bipartisan effort led by Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., who is a Navy veteran, would fix the tax law to classify survivor benefits as earned income.
"Democrats and Republicans agree - we must fix a broken system and ensure Gold Star families are not victims of a tax hike," Luria said in a statement.
But a legislative fix to other targets is less far along. The kiddie tax expansion appears to be one of several unintended consequences of a tax law that Republicans rushed through Congress in less than two months - and a byproduct of conservatives' desire to simplify the tax code and bring in new revenues to help offset the fiscal cost of cutting tax rates for individuals and businesses.
Congress originally established the tax in the bipartisan 1986 tax reform law, then tweaked it in a 2003 tax package passed under President George W. Bush. It forces children to pay taxes on both earned income - like salaries from summer jobs - and unearned income, like stock dividends and nontuition scholarships.
The different types of income have different rates, and until the Trump tax overhaul passed, the rate for unearned income was tied to how much a child's parents earned. That meant scholarship winners from low-income families, whose parents had little or no federal income tax liability, also faced low tax rates.
The 2017 law evolved quickly as it sped through the House and the Senate. Almost from the start in the House, it included the change to kiddie tax rates for unearned income. When the Ways and Means Committee approved the tax-cut bill for a vote of the full House, Republicans included a report that said the bill "simplifies the 'kiddie tax' by effectively applying the rates applicable to trusts."
While the change increased tax bills for some groups, it also effectively capped the amount of taxes for wealthy individuals.
The language was maintained in the Senate version of the bill, as well as the final agreement that Trump signed in December 2017.
Republicans now say they did not anticipate that it would raise taxes on low-income scholarship winners.
Jesse A. Solis, a Republican spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee, said that the 2017 tax law had achieved a long-sought goal of simplifying the tax code.
"When we first discovered that changes made to how unearned income for students is taxed was having unintended consequences on some college scholarships, we quickly went to work on solutions," Solis said. "Discussions with the majority are ongoing, and we are hopeful that bipartisan action can be taken soon to provide greater certainty for students and their families."
Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is working with his colleagues in the Senate and the House to address this issue as quickly as possible, according to a committee spokesman.
"Historically, after major tax legislation, the long-standing practice has been to correct drafting errors and other technical issues on a bipartisan basis," Grassley said after reports of the Gold Star family tax increase came to light.
Democrats have expressed openness to fixing some other problems caused by the law, including harm to restaurant owners seeking to remodel their establishments. But after unanimously opposing the law, they are likely to demand a price for getting Republicans out of a political jam. Any fix would need to roll back some provisions of the law, Democrats say.
The new tax structure imposes a range of levies on unearned income: 10% on amounts up to $2,550, 24% on unearned income over $2,550, 35% on amounts over $9,150 and 37% on amounts over $12,500. According to the College Board, the average cost of room and board in the 2018-19 school year at a four-year public university is $11,140, and $12,680 at a private four-year school.
In the past, a student from a household with a joint income of $50,000 who was awarded a scholarship that covered $11,500 in room and board would be taxed at their parents' rate of 12%. Under the new law, that money would be taxed up to 35%.
"It's one of those things that is under the radar now but could really have a big impact," said Megan McClean Coval, the vice president for policy and federal relations at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.

Scott D. Pierce: CBS renews ‘Bull’ despite sexual harassment; Constance Wu’s Twitter tantrum is NOT about #MeToo

Texto completo: As the five broadcast networks unveiled their 2019-20 schedules over the past few days, the two biggest surprises involved a pair of returning series.
It was absolutely astonishing that CBS could be tone-deaf enough to renew “Bull,” and “Fresh Off the Boat” star Constance Wu’s reaction to her show’s renewal was just so wrong.
A WHOLE LOT OF “BULL” • News broke in December that “Bull” star Michael Weatherly sexually harassed actress Eliza Dushku on the set of the show. If it aired on another network, the reaction would be: “What? They renewed that show? With all the baggage attached to it?”
But this is CBS, so the reaction is more like: “WHAT?!? THEY RENEWED THAT SHOW?!?”
CBS lost its chairman-CEO, Leslie Moonves; one of its lead journalists, Charlie Rose; and the executive producer of “60 Minutes,” Jeff Fager, to sexual harassment scandals. It has faced seemingly unending stories about how it long tolerated a culture that denigrates and discriminates against women.
So, yeah, giving Weatherly a pass is a big deal. Among other things, he told Dushku he wanted to have a threesome with her, and invited her into his “rape van.”
This is not a he-said, she-said situation — Weatherly’s behavior is on filmed outtakes, which were sent to Dushku’s lawyers by CBS’ lawyers. And this was not a one-time incident — the harassment extended over weeks.
And yet CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl defended Weatherly in comments to reporters before the network’s upfront presentation to advertisers on Thursday.
“Michael made a mistake in his comments. He owned that mistake. He was apologetic at the time, and he was remorseful,” Kahl said. “He was willing to take any kind of coaching or training we deem necessary for him to create a positive environment on the set.”
Not only had the “Bull” cast and crew been given anti-sexual harassment training before any of this happened, Weatherly’s contrition came after Dushku was fired for complaining; after the video of his behavior was seen by lawyers; after Dushku accepted a $9.5 million settlement; and after Weatherly minimized — aka lied about — what happened to The New York Times.
Yet Kahl said he felt “comfortable” continuing to work with Weatherly. “He, I believe, took everything very seriously and wants to move forward. He’s a dad, he’s a father. He was upset by this. He wants to make it better,” he said.
Of course he wants to move forward. He’s reportedly making almost $4 million a season. And it’s OK because he’s a father? That’s a ridiculous excuse that reeks of the same good ol’ boys behavior that plagues CBS.
I like Kahl. He’s a good guy and a talented programmer. But his defense of Weatherly is appalling. And it undercuts everything he says his network is doing to reform itself.
It undercut the message that CBS — which has done a good job of increasing the ethnic diversity of its series leads in the past year — is becoming less male-centric. (Two of its five new fall shows have female leads; two more feature women as co-leads; two of those four women are African American.)
And it’s not just TV critics like me who think renewing “Bull” is a serious issue. Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment — which co-produced the show with CBS Television Studios — pulled out when the network renewed it for Season 4.
That renewal sends a message. The same old wrong message.
BITTER ABOUT “THE BOAT” • “Fresh Off the Boat” star Constance Wu made headlines when ABC renewed that sitcom and she took to social media, tweeting obscenities and “So upset right now I’m literally crying.” When a fan tweeted congratulations for the “great news,” Wu replied, “No it’s not.” And she disliked a post on the show’s Instagram announcing the renewal.
Wu followed that with a long explanation about how she was “temporarily upset” about the renewal because it meant she had to turn down “another project that I was really passionate about.” Which is believable.
Then she went on to explain that she loves “FOTB” and that anyone who took her tweets to mean otherwise is wrong. Which is far less believable.
These words are my truth. I hope you hear them pic.twitter.com/l6SvbFcUlj
— Constance Wu (@ConstanceWu) May 11, 2019
Wu has a reputation for being difficult. I have personally seen her being rude to people who were treating her with kid gloves. For whatever that’s worth.
What I find completely offensive was the end of Wu’s explanation: “It’s meaningful when you make the choice to believe women.”
So ... she’s tying her behavior, which had nothing with her gender, to the #MeToo movement? That’s ridiculously cynical.
ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke handled the situation as well as she could. “I’m going to choose to believe Constance’s most recent communication about the show that she is happy to return and the cast and crew is happy to have her back and we’re thrilled to keep her in the show,” she said.
Right.

Según el diario neoyorquino, de todas las transacciones involucradas se haría un reporte para la unidad especializada del Departamento del Tesoro , pero dichos análisis nunca fueron enviados.
Partel del personal involucrado en el proceso afirmó que revisó las transacciones, hizo los informes de actividades sospechosas, pero los ejecutivos de Deutsche Bank, no reportaron los actos ocurridos durante los años de campaña, de transición de gobierno y el primer año de la Administración Trump.
Entre las actividades sospechosas se reportan grandes cantidades de en efectivo depositado por entidades o personas extranjeras, una práctica común entre desarrolladores inmobiliarios, como el presidente Trump y el esposo de Ivanka Trump , pero que al mismo tiempo desatan suspicacias sobre lavado de dinero.
El reporte del Times indica que las transacciones del mandatario y su yerno no necesariamente son “actos criminales”, pero la falta de reportes ante el Gobierno desatan todo tipo de dudas, sobre todo porque el presidente Trump se ha negado a dar a conocer sus informes de impuestos.

Texto completo: An Elizabethtown College professor appeared on national television last week to discuss research about the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award recently given to golfer Tiger Woods.
The award is the nation’s highest civilian honor and is presented every so often by the commander in chief.
National media outlets have increasingly reached out to Elizabethtown’s political scientists for context about the medal.
Dr. Kyle Kopko appeared on CNN May 6 to discuss the most recent recipient of the award, 2019 Masters golf champion Tiger Woods.
Kopko almost missed his first of two appearances on the network that day.
“I was on (Route) 283 stuck in traffic on my way up to WITF,” he recalled in a telephone interview with LNP Thursday.
Awards politics
Kopko and fellow Elizabethtown professor Dr. E. Fletcher McClellan are among several co-authors of a study published in 2015 on the Presidential Medal of Freedom and its political implications.
The idea to analyze the award came after the oxymoronic view in the East Room of the White House in 2012. Among the recipients that year: musician Bob Dylan.
“Here’s a guy who’s anti-establishment being recognized by the establishment,” Kopko said. “We found that interesting.”
The study that followed, “The Politics of the Presidential Medal of Freedom: A Fifty Year Analysis, 1963-2013,” examined the award under 10 presidents.
The professors’ research included President John F. Kennedy, who re-worked the award by executive order. Instead of focusing on awarding those in service of U.S. national security, Kennedy moved to an award for outstanding civilian achievement. He was assassinated before he could award his first medal.
The study found the number of awards has increased over the years, and the types of civilian achievement recognized has differed by political party.
For example, nearly one in four of Presidential Medal of Honor recipients under President Barack Obama were artists. Nearly 30% of recipients under President Richard Nixon were journalists, broadcasters, or editors, something Kopko called “fascinating” considering press revelations in the Watergate scandal.
Perennial talking head
After the study was published, Kopko said he emailed the study to several news organizations, including The New York Times.
Not long after, the study was referenced in a Times article in late 2015.
Since then, the study has repeatedly caught the eye of journalists at The Times, as well as CNN, CSPAN, NPR, BuzzFeed News and other national news outlets.
Kopko says he now regularly receives calls to chime in when a new batch of recipients is announced.
McClellan, a self-professed awards buff, also found it interesting to see whether there was any calculation in the awards to improve poll numbers or to return political favors (they found no impact in approval ratings).
Besides, the professors said, the recipients of the award are ultimately left to the commander in chief.
“Those are pretty unique unilateral powers,” McClellan said.

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have subpoenaed pay records for a recently retired Long Island Rail Road worker whose overtime earnings made him the highest-paid employee at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority last year, as well as the records of more than a dozen other MTA employees, a source with knowledge of the matter said Friday. 
The development would make the U.S. Attorney's Office the latest government agency to probe the alarmingly high rate of overtime paid by the MTA, particularly to LIRR workers.
The source, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, said federal prosecutors requested "payroll and other records" for the workers about two and a half weeks ago, shortly after the release of an Empire Center for Public Policy report detailing the authority's payroll in 2018.
The report revealed that six of the top 10 earners at the MTA last year were LIRR laborers, whose senior status allowed them to significantly increase their take-home pay by piling on overtime. The MTA's highest-paid employee last year, LIRR chief measurement officer Thomas Caputo, made $344,147 in overtime on top of his base salary of $117,499, according to the report.
Caputo, 55, of Holbrook, could not be reached for comment Friday. The U.S. Attorney's Office's Southern District of New York, the MTA and the office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo all declined to comment.
News of the federal subpoenas was first reported by The New York Times.
LIRR union leader Anthony Simon and bus and subways union leader John Samuelsen both said they had no direct knowledge of a federal investigation.
"I have, and our members have said all along we do not and will never condone bad behavior," Simon, general chairman of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, said Friday. "Our men and women do a great job every day, and I will support them and thank them for the amazing work they do. We will continue to do our jobs and do them well."
Samuelsen, president of the Transport Workers Union, said he learned of the investigation through media reports, and that he was not aware of any of his 40,000 members having received a federal subpoena. 
"If anybody at the MTA has evidence [of overtime abuse], they should show it to us. We're not going to condone straight-up criminality," Samuelsen said Friday. "The flip side of that coin is that we're going to defend our members until the end, if there are false allegations of widespread criminality."
The MTA, its inspector general, Barry Kluger, and the Queens District Attorney's Office also are looking into the potential for overtime abuse at the MTA.
MTA chairman Patrick Foye has called for increased scrutiny of workers' time and attendance, including through the use of new state-of-the-art biometric attendance recorders at employee facilities that were supposed to replace disparate systems where workers sign in on paper forms or report their attendance by phone. 
Foye also briefly had MTA Police monitor employee attendance at some locations last week - a move that further outraged union leaders. Foye has said he believes the vast majority of the MTA's overtime costs, which reached $418 million last year, is legitimate, but that a "small fraction" is fraudulent.
In contrast, MTA Board member Lawrence Schwartz, who represents Cuomo, last week alleged "constant overtime, payroll and pension abuses" throughout the MTA, and called for yet another investigation - this one to be led by a contracted ex-prosecutor. 
Ricardo Sanchez, general chairman of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 589, which represents more than 1,000 LIRR employees, called any claims of widespread fraud among the railroad's labor ranks "reckless."
"I don't know if it exists, but I don't see it here . . . Can it happen? Absolutely. The system needs to be improved," Sanchez said Friday. "The vast majority of employees do their job and work within the time frame that they're given and do what they're supposed to

Dems want US review of Russian investment in mill

Texto completo: Several Democrats in Congress have asked for a federal review of a Russian company's forthcoming $200 million investment in Braidy Industries' planned $1.7 billion aluminum rolling mill in Eastern Kentucky.
Last month, United Co. Rusal announced its intention to invest in Braidy's mill in return for a 40% share in the facility, which is set to open fully in 2021 and begin producing aluminum sheet and plate for the automotive and aerospace industries.
This week, Rusal and Braidy said their respective boards of directors had approved the deal, which is slated to close by June 30, according to a joint news release. The Russian company also has said it intends to supply aluminum for Braidy's mill from a smelter that's under construction in Siberia.
The U.S. previously placed sanctions on Rusal, as well as co-owner Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch. The sanctions on Rusal as well as En+ Group, its parent company, were lifted earlier this year.
Kentucky's senators, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul, joined other Republicans in voting down a measure in January that opposed ending those sanctions.
Now, eight congressional Democrats have expressed concern about Rusal's investment in Braidy's planned mill — citing the fact that parent company En+ is "substantially owned by individuals and entities with close ties to the Russian government" — in a letter they sent Thursday to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a copy of which the New York Times included in its report on their request.
"Russia remains a central threat to U.S. national security and prosperity and is, along with China, one of our most aggressive and capable adversaries. The proposed investment by En+ — a company that is majority owned by a U.S.-sanctioned Russian national and Russian state bank — in an American aluminum mill, raises serious questions of national security," they wrote to Mnuchin.
They suggested that the proposed deal between Rusal and Braidy should be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is a federal, interagency group with the power to review transactions that involve foreign investments in America, as well as to potentially impose conditions on those arrangements.
The Democrats who signed the letter were U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, as well as U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters of California, Eliot Engel of New York, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, Jim Himes of Connecticut and Lloyd Doggett of Texas.
U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Louisville, said he thinks his fellow Democrats' request for a a federal review is "totally appropriate" and noted that the aluminum industry is part of the supply chain for a lot of national defense-related production.
"Those companies (Rusal and En+) have indicated they're going to make investments across the country in aluminum, so if you've essentially got Russian interests controlling part of the supply chain of Defense Department products then you've got a potential risk to national security," Yarmuth told the Courier Journal Friday afternoon.
Rusal's investment in the mill may be "perfectly all right" in the end, he said, but a review is warranted. As for whether the review his colleagues have asked for will actually happen, Yarmuth indicated that it's unlikely.
"There's no reason to believe that Treasury and Mnuchin would change their tune and think they should cooperate with congressional leadership that's Democratic," he said.
Kentucky's state government is literally invested in the success of Braidy's planned aluminum mill, which has been praised by government officials as an economic development project that could be a big help to job-starved Eastern Kentucky. In 2017, Gov. Matt Bevin's administration helped arrange an unusual $15million direct state investment in Braidy Industries in return for an ownership stake and a promise that the company would create more than 500 long-term, high-paying jobs.
The Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development said through a spokesman that it believes there is no credible reason to hold back the economic redevelopment of an area in Eastern Kentucky that has a substantial need for it.
"We respect that any federal analysis of Rusal's investment ... would be a matter occurring above the level of our Cabinet and Kentucky," cabinet spokesman Jack Mazurak said in an email. "That said, we're confident this minority investment in a Braidy Industries subsidiary would pass any such scrutiny."
Braidy broke ground on the mill in June 2018 but has spent the last several months trying to secure enough financing to fully fund the mill's construction. The deadline for its roughly $500 million stock sale, which has been extended multiple times, is June 15.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Craig Bouchard, Braidy Industries' CEO and chairman, "rejected the notion that the deal could be blocked by the committee, citing a provision in the regulations excluding from review start-ups or so-called greenfield investments, such as building a plant."
The Times also reported that Bouchard considered the criticism over Rusal's plan to invest in his company's mill to be politically driven.
Robert Steurer, a spokesman for McConnell, said in an email that the senator has said in the past that Rusal's investment in the Kentucky-based mill did not play a role in his stance on sanctions. In January 2019, McConnell noted that the sanctions against "corrupt Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska" were staying in place and would continue limiting his influence over certain companies.
Deripaska is fighting the sanctions, saying the allegations against him are baseless.
The Courier Journal's requests for comment from Braidy Industries and the governor's office were not immediately returned on Friday.

'Do over' proms pursue perpetual adolescence

Texto completo: Prom season is upon us. We all know what that means: More American adults are doing their proms all over again.
A New York Times headline about a growing number of adults says they are taking "A Second Shot to Have the Best Night of their Lives."
And carry on like retrograde adolescents.
The modern prom, reports Slate, "may be traced to the Ivy League and the annual tradition of a 'presentation week,' during which formal dress and dancing accompanied a promenade concert."
Not content with only the well-to-do experiencing the awkwardness and misery of the prom, high schools across America embraced it, particularly after World War II. Now the prom is a rite of passage for American teens everywhere, with many blowing thousands of dollars on their big nights.
But I certainly wouldn't want to do my prom over.
I didn't know my date very well. She was in my photography class, very pretty and still available.
When she agreed to go with me, she greatly disrupted the Bethel Park High School prom-date pecking order. Whereas my date greatly raised my social status — even my friends and family were shocked she'd go with me — I lowered hers.
She was awfully sore about it.
"I heard about you," she told me at our pre-prom date. "A regular class clown! You better not show up in a limo, wear a top hat or cane or do anything else to embarrass me!"
That set the tone for an unpleasant weekend.
We got lost on the way to the prom, lost on the way to my friend Cook's cabin in Ohio and lost on the way home. My first foray into the adult world was rough, to be sure — a precursor, regrettably, of many more unpleasant adult experiences to come.
Similarly awkward prom experiences may motivate the growing number of adults trying to "get it right" during a second round.
But there are no "do overs" in life. Didn't novelist Thomas Wolfe make it clear we "can't go home again"?
Prom is supposed to be a teen's first foray into the adult world, not an adult's return to adolescence.
That's not stopping ever more "adults" from trying. Too many are not just doing their proms over, they're doing summer camps over, too — another hot trend.
To be sure, a growing desire for perpetual adolescence among today's "adults" is revealing itself all over the place — from delaying moving out of their parents' homes to delaying marriage and parenthood. That same desire leads Hollywood to keep recycling favorite movies and TV shows from their adolescence.
Look, if you had an unpleasant prom experience when you were 18, as I did, those are the breaks.
I wrote an earlier, light-heartedcolumn about my experience. It was published all over the country.
After that piece ran, I bumped into my old prom date at the grocery store. She still looked great, but, boy, she was really sore now.
It turns out her husband was so delighted by her rare rude behavior, he carries the column around in his wallet, showing it to total strangers.
The joy I get from that story almost makes my lousy prom experience worthwhile — but certainly not enough to make me want to do the prom all over again.

Texto completo: The Victoria's Secret fashion show, an annual spectacle of glitter, cleavage and pop music, will no longer air on network television after a nearly two-decade run.
The announcement was made in a memo last week to the chain's associates from Leslie Wexner, chief executive of Victor as Secret's parent company, L Brands. Wexner said the company had been "taking a fresh look at every aspect of our business" in the pest few months, and noted that the brand "must evolve and change to grow."
"With that in mind, we have decided to re-think the traditional Victoria's Secret Fashion Show," he wrote. "Going forward we don't believe network television is the right fit." He said the company would develop 'a new kind of event" on different platforms in the future, though he gave no further details.
The decision comes as Victor as Secret, the largest lingerie company in the United States, works to revamp its image and as interest in the once-major TV event has plummeted. The show first aired in 2001 with an hourlong special on ABC. It attracted millions of viewers who tuned in to watch the brand's supermodels strut runways in 6-inch heels, crystal-encrusted lingerie and massive wings, with musical performances from megastars like Taylor Swift, the Spice Girls and Lady Gaga. Some decried the show and criticized it for objectifying women. But many viewed the event as a stroke of marketing genius - a commercial for the Victoria's Secret brand packaged as a prime-time special.
But those days are long gone. Viewership for the show, which has hopscotched between ABC and CBS, dropped by roughly two-thirds within five years. Last year, it drew an audience of 3.3 mill on viewers, down from 9.7 million viewers in 2013.
The fashion show attracted unwanted attention late last year, when Edward Razek, chief marketing officer of L Brands, came under fire for comments he made about casting plus-size and transgender models in the event.
"So it's like, why don't you do 50?" Razek said, referring to sizing, in en interview with Vogue. "Why don't you dc 60? Why don't you do 24? It's like, why doesn't your show do this? Shouldn't you have transsexuals in the show? No. No, I don't think we should. Well, why not? Because the show is a fantasy. It's a 42-minute entertainment special."
Wexner said in his memo last week that the newly appointed head of the Victoria's Secret lingerie business and his team were "re-birthing the brand," and expressed his excitement about its future.
"We have made enormous progress in a very short time, and are looking forward to a successful fall and holiday with an elevated, fashion-forward assortment" he wrote.

La advertencia del gobierno Trump a 570,000 empleadores de inmigrantes

Texto completo: El gobierno de Donald Trump reactivó una práctica de 2012 en la que avisa a los empleadores de inmigrates cuando sus nombres y los números de seguro social no coinciden, informó el New York Times.
La Administración de la Seguridad Social ha enviado “cartas sin correspondencia” a más de 570,000 empleadores desde marzo de este año , reportó el diario neoyorquino.
Estas cartas notifican a los empleadores que presentaron formularios de impuestos W-2, que contienen nombres de empleados y números de Seguro Social que no coinciden.
Las razones de estas discrepancias pueden ser inofensivas, como los cambios en los nombres conyugales y los errores tipográficos en los formularios, pero también pueden indicar el uso fraudulento de documentos por parte de los inmigrantes.
De acuerdo con la Ley las cartas de no coincidencia no requieren que los empleadores tomen medidas contra un empleado, sino que les piden que corrijan el desajuste en un plazo de 60 días .
El gobierno comenzó a enviar este tipo de cartas en 1993 y dejó de hacerlo en 2012. Este marzo bajo nuevos lineamientos del gobierno Trump se reactivó la práctica.
Aunque las cartas de “no coincidencia “no amenazan con una acción legal, los empleadores se quedan en el limbo, ya que tienen que sopesar la pérdida de trabajadores con las posibilidades de ser castigados por las autoridades federales de inmigración en el futuro.
No está claro si la SSA planea compartir los desajustes de las bases de datos de ICE y USCIS para emprender la búsqueda de inmigrantes que esten trabajando sin tener el permiso laboral expedido por el gobierno.
Según una investigación de, Pew Research publicada el mes pasado en EEUU habría aproximadamente 7.8 millones de trabajadores no autorizados en la fuerza laboral de los EEUU .
Por su parte cuarenta y seis legisladores demócratas escribieron una carta a la Administración del Seguro Social a principios de este mes pidiéndole que dejara de escribir las cartas ya que según ellos solo crea miedo entre los empleadores y los empleados inmigrantes.

Texto completo: Big-bucks bunny: A stainless steel sculpture of a rabbit by Jeff Koons has set an auction record in New York, fetching over $91 million. The sale of Koons' 1986 "Rabbit" at Christie's was the most expensive work by a living artist ever sold at auction. The previous record was set by British artist David Hockney. His 1972 "Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)" brought in $90.3 million at Christie's last year. The New York Times says Robert E. Mnuchin, an art dealer and the father of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, was the winning bidder for "Rabbit."
Shakira cleared: A Spanish court has cleared Colombian singers Shakira and Carlos Vives of a plagiarism claim after rejecting a lawsuit brought against them by a Cuban-born singer and producer. Livan Rafael Castellanos had accused Shakira and Vives of plagiarizing his 1997 song "Yo te quiero tanto" in their award-winning hit "La Bicicleta."

Mercy student memorializes children lost to gun violence

Texto completo: Lamadre Tecory Harris was known as the "cut-up jean king" because he used to alter denim pants to make new clothes. On Nov. 13, 2018, he was shot to death, shortly after walking to a market with his sister for an after-school snack.
Elizabeth Meisenzahl, an Our Lady of Mercy School for Young Women senior, wrote about Lamadre's fashion creations, his love of basketball and his status as the "family goofball."
Her memorial for the 16-year-old Las Vegas boy is part of "Since Parkland," a student journalism effort aimed at bringing life to this sad statistic: at least 1,149 children were killed by guns in America during the year following the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.
Around 200 student journalists memorialized one year's worth of gun violence victims who died under the age of 18. The project was supported by The Trace, a nonprofit news organization that reports on gun violence, The Miami Herald and McClatchy. "We want you to feel that every child's gun death is unacceptable," its website reads.
Meisenzahl took on 20 profiles. She wrote that 2-year-old David Jermaine Hall was pictured in a tiny bowtie, suspenders and a straw hat, in his funeral program at Freewall Missionary Baptist Church. He died from a fatal gunshot wound on Oct. 29, 2018, in Alabama.
She wrote about Javonne Micheal Jaylin Luke Davis, who collected and repaired bikes to give younger kids in his neighborhood. He had been accepted to Rutgers Future Scholars, a program that would have given him a chance to earn a full college scholarship. He was shot while walking home from school on Nov. 13, 2018.
She wrote that 17-year-old Marcus Milkel Flanigan was the oldest of five and cooked for his younger siblings. "Who will cook little brothers' dinners?" read the headline.
She found information about the young people through news reports and police files. In some cases, she made contact with mourning parents and relatives. Memories of the deceased were often found in the comments of GoFundMe pages that raised money for funeral costs.
Elizabeth spent about three hours working on each profile, she said. She hopes that it will make readers "see what a massive problem we have."
Meisenzahl has also written for Ms. Magazine and Her Culture Magazine. An oped she wrote encouraging the Catholic Church to accept women as priests was a runner-up in the 2018 New York Times Student Editorial Contest and was published on NYTimes.com.
is the editor in chief of Mercy's newspaper The Quill.
Her mother, Becky Meisenzahl, is very proud. "She's a great kid and she works really hard."
She lives in Lima, Livingston County, and is headed to the University of Pennsylvania after graduation. Her English teacher John Baynes expects her to go far. "Elizabeth is a learning machine fueled by the joy of understanding and meaning," he wrote in a letter of recommendation.
She said she aims to fight injustice, perhaps as a journalist or lawyer. She hopes her work with the "Since Parkland" project has made people see young shooting victims as more than a number. "I hope it humanizes the victims of gun violence," she said.

Grassley on tariffs: They 'brought about' Hitler

Texto completo: Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley on Wednesday blamed a 1930 tariff law for bringing about the Great Depression, the rise of Adolf Hitler and World War II.
"As I like to tell the president when he says he likes tariffs, I try to remind him that Smoot-Hawley brought about the Great Depression, brought about Adolf Hitler, brought about World War II, brought about 60 million people losing their lives as a result of it," Grassley said. He was speaking to the National Association of Farm Broadcasting about tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.
Trump last week said he would hike tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in Chinese imports after trade negotiations stalled. Chinese officials said in return it would raise tariffs up to 25% on $60 billion in U.S. goods. Trump's administration also seeks to place tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese goods.
Grassley said on Wednesday that the U.S. then reduced its tariffs and that poverty has dropped worldwide since the end of World War II.
"I like to tell the president that globalism has helped everybody. Freeing up trade has helped everybody," Grassley said.
The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which President Herbert Hoover signed in 1930, raised tariffs on a variety of products. The U.S. Senate's website describes the law as "among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history" and said that the United States' trading partners retaliated with tariffs, worsening the Great Depression.
Grassley has been making similar comments about the Smoot-Hawley Act for years.
In 2019, Grassley said of Hoover, a fellow Iowa Republican: "He signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Bill, and the United States became protectionist, the world became protectionist. It shut down world trade and probably contributed more than any other decision to the Great Depression becoming worldwide. And the Great Depression is a part of the reason that Hitler rose to power and we lost 60 million people in World War II."
In 2016, Grassley also warned Trump's tariffs could be damaging, again citing the Smoot-Hawley act.
"You shot down international trade because we protect, other countries protect. Then you have a deep depression. And then you have Hitler come to power. And then you have 60 million people murdered as a result of World War II. We don't want to go down that route again," Grassley told the New York Times that year.

Kimmel Saves Disney's Supersize Upfront

Texto completo: The TV industry is unveiling its coming season to advertisers in Manhattan this week at a series of events known as the upfronts. Three New York Times media reporters -- John Koblin, Edmund Lee and Michael M. Grynbaum -- assess the Disney presentation at David Geffen Hall on Tuesday.
JOHN: The Walt Disney Company just put on its first oversize upfront -- welcoming the newly acquired Fox properties like FX and National Geographic to the fold, which already included ABC, ESPN and Freeform. It only took about two and a half hours to get through it all.
MICHAEL: At the end, Jimmy Kimmel threatened to extend the thing another 90 minutes because "Bob just bought more networks" -- a shrewd and funny reference to the Disney chief Bob Iger's recent shopping spree.
EDMUND: Disney executives thought Kimmel killed it.
JOHN: He did indeed. His material also came at around the two-hour mark, so we needed it. More on Kimmel in a minute, but let's talk about a theme of the week: stability. Yesterday NBC claimed to have the schedule that had changed the least. Fox proudly said it had only a few slots to fill outside of sports, and CBS always lays claim to the "stable" tagline. ABC picked up only three new shows for the fall. Karey Burke, ABC's entertainment head, said something interesting about this. She said debuting too many shows at this moment of Peak TV is a disservice to new programs and -- here's the key point -- "networks just don't have the marketing budgets to launch those shows properly."
EDMUND: It was another way of saying you can't just greenlight a bunch of shows and expect people to watch them, even if they're good. Arguably, that's been Netflix's playbook. Streaming seemed very much on the minds of TV executives this week.
JOHN: Let's consider this. It's upfront week, and yet it feels like we've been through this already. Apple had a veritable upfront in Cupertino in late March. Hulu (now completely controlled by Disney) put on its own presentation a few weeks ago at Madison Square Garden. And Disney's other streaming service, Disney Plus, scheduled to start in November, held an event on its lot in Burbank last month.
EDMUND: Both Hulu and Disney Plus are now run by the Disney executive Kevin Mayer, who opened tonight's upfront -- that was a surprise. He has been talked about as a potential successor to Iger, and at the after-party, he looked like he was on a receiving line, with executives practically lined up to congratulate him.
JOHN: He also had a large role at the Burbank event.
MICHAEL: ABC broke from NBC and Fox by featuring brand executives boasting about product placement on their shows. Given Donald Glover's creative cred with "Atlanta," which is now part of Disney, I was surprised to learn that his ordering a Miller High Life in one episode was just marketing.
EDMUND: Maybe the ads are getting ... smarter?
JOHN: The broadcast networks' presentations have had their share of celebrities (Kardashians, Tina Fey, Justin Timberlake), but just how much are they overshadowed at this point?
EDMUND: I'd argue Hulu had the biggest names so far. Margot Robbie, Reese Witherspoon and George Clooney showed up for the Hulu event.
JOHN: The networks are concerned. One thing the Fox Entertainment head Charlie Collier conceded to me last week: "We will be out-P.R.ed by the sexy new platforms." But he made the argument that when companies need to move a product or change perceptions, they do it by advertising on a broadcast network. True?
EDMUND: I think he's right. The N.F.L. still relies on the broadcasters to show its biggest games because they still generate the largest real-time audiences. It's also where advertisers go for big awareness campaigns. Netflix is great, but I have to rely on watch guides and blogs, even Twitter, to find what I want there.
JOHN: Let's consider some of the new shows we saw today. ABC has a "black-ish" spinoff called "mixed-ish," a prequel story about Tracee Ellis Ross's character, Rainbow Johnson, growing up in the 1980s. If "Young Sheldon" worked for CBS as a Sheldon Cooper spinoff from "The Big Bang Theory" ...

MICHAEL: How about Chris Rock starring in the next season of "Fargo"! Even Rock looked a little confused, and he only appeared in a prerecorded interview.
EDMUND: The new Cobie Smulders vehicle, "Stumptown," looked pretty good. She plays a private investigator with a gambling problem. Sold. And "mixed-ish" is the third show Kenya Barris is doing for Disney.

JOHN: Lest we be reminded, Ed: Netflix signed him to a lucrative contract after he got into a disagreement with ABC over its handling of a "black-ish" episode. And speaking of Netflix, Jimmy Kimmel was referring to the departed executive Channing Dungey, who decamped for Netflix, when he said: "I can't believe Channing left us for Netflix. Who does she think she is, our viewers?"
EDMUND: And she wasn't the only one. Shonda Rhimes, who created the sturdy ABC hit "Grey's Anatomy," left for Netflix, too. And Kimmel said: "Channing leaving us to work at Netflix was -- to borrow a Yiddish term -- such a Shonda."
JOHN: O.K., one more. When talking about NBC, Kimmel said: "They have 'This Is Us,' which was so popular it was renewed for three years. Or as Constance Wu would call it: a death sentence." Jimmy Kimmel won the upfronts.

Texto completo: Last Saturday - a beautiful, sunny day in West Oakland - the banquet room at the West Oakland Senior Center (WOSC) was filled with over 200 people celebrating Mother's Day and enjoying breakfast served by the men of McClymond's High School Alumni Association.
Over four generations were represented in the room and greetings, short speeches, dance, song, and music by DJ Sam Robinson made the event one of the best parties of the season.
Masters of Ceremonies Sylvester Hodges and Marlin Eagles, whose granddaughter sang, were dressed in tuxedos and kept the crowd laughing and applauding. Hodges sang a wonderful impromptu piece and the crowd sang along.
Jazz singer Carolyn Jones, who performs at Geoffrey's Inner Circle and other local venues, made an impromptu appearance with a spirited rendition of "Trouble the Waters." Keynote speaker Dr. Doris Peeler-Brown of the now closed East Bay Law Center gave remarks, and New York Times bestselling author Mary Monroe read from her books.
Gilda Baker, one of the honorees and a member of the WOSC Advisory Board Events Committee, filmed the event. She spoke to the assembled crowd, "You are important and valued, and are always welcome here." She said her goal is to increase use of the center by the Oakland community.
New WOSC Director Jendayi Santana was not in attendance, but her administrative assistant Sharia Lewis, granddaughter of Special Honoree Queen Ester Woodrow, fondly known as "Mama Queen," was a hardworking and efficient stand-in.
Ms. Lewis handed family members T-shirts honoring her grandmother, who just turned 99 years old. Additional honorees were 94-year-old Maggie Lewis, whose daughter attended for her, Katina Tate, Advisory Board Member Gilda Tate, Alice Woods, and Mattie Williams In Memoriam. Certificates were presented to all honorees.
The Senior Center motto is, "Ability is Ageless," and the attendees proved that with their enthusiasm, arts presentations, and goodwill. For more information on programs and hours, call 510-238-7016, or visit at 1724 Adeline, Oakland, CA.

Wolves to interview 4 more

Texto completo: Timberwolves President Gersson Rosas is expanding the search for a head coach, but that doesn't mean Rosas has eliminated interim coach Ryan Saunders from getting the job.
Rosas will interview at least four candidates -- Miami assistant Juwan Howard, Portland assistant David Vanterpool, New Orleans associate head coach Chris Finch and Milwaukee assistant Darvin Ham -- a source confirmed to the Star Tribune.
Even though Rosas is interviewing multiple people for the position, Saunders remains a strong candidate for the job.
Rosas will be in Chicago the next few days representing the Wolves at the draft lottery and combine, but a source said Rosas should make a decision on the head coaching position possibly by the end of the week or over the weekend.
Last week Rosas spent several hours over three days discussing the position with Saunders. Their discussions ranged from personnel to style of play, player development, building an assistant coaching staff and how to modernize the Wolves' offense into an up-tempo efficient offense.
But their conversations haven't just dealt with issues on the court. They have discussed the importance of communication, leadership and how best to succeed in the Minnesota market in collaboration with other aspects of the organization, the source said.
Of the four candidates Rosas is interviewing, Finch, 49, is an intriguing one given his ties to Rosas. The two worked together previously in Houston where Finch was an assistant coach from 2011 to 2016. He served one season in Denver before joining the staff in New Orleans the last two seasons. Before becoming an assistant in Houston, Finch also worked two seasons as the head coach of the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, Houston's G-League affiliate.
Rosas played a big part in developing talent and implementing systems and style of play in the G-League when he was with Houston. Finch and the Vipers won a G-League title in 2009-10.
Howard, 46, was a member of Michigan's famed Fab Five who played 19 seasons in the league. He has been an assistant in Miami since retiring after the 2012-13 season.
Vanterpool, 46, went to St. Bonaventure and played 22 games for the Wizards in 2001 but played primarily in China and Europe. He has been an assistant in Portland since 2013.
Ham, 45, served two seasons as an assistant with the Lakers and five with the Hawks before joining the Bucks staff under Mike Budenholzer this season. The Bucks are about to play the Raptors in the Eastern Conference finals. Ham played in parts of eight seasons from 1996 to 2005.ESPN first reported Howard and Vanterpool's interviews, the New York Times first reported Finch's while the Athletic first reported Ham's.
"The plans mandate to build a world-class organization, that's something that's critical," Rosas said last week at his introductory news conference. "And we're going to bring in high-level people here, and over time I would love this organization to be a hotbed for future coaches and future GMs because of the success we're having."
When he took the job, Rosas vowed to question everything the organization does.
Even though it has been widely expected that Saunders will end up as the coach, Rosas is still vetting other candidates instead of just handing the job to Saunders.
Saunders has made a good impression on Rosas to pair with his strong relationship with owner Glen Taylor, who also owns the Star Tribune, and his relationships with Wolves players, such as Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins.
Saunders, 33, took over the Wolves after Taylor fired Tom Thibodeau on Jan. 6. Under Saunders, the Wolves went 17-25 and missed the playoffs.

International worries flare US-Iran relations

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- International worries that the Trump administration is sliding toward war with Iran flared into the open Tuesday amid skepticism about its claims that the Islamic Republic poses a growing threat to the U.S. and its allies in the Persian Gulf and beyond.

The U.S. military rebutted doubts expressed by a British general about such a threat. President Donald Trump denied a report that the administration has updated plans to send more than 100,000 troops to counter Iran if necessary. But Trump then stirred the controversy further by saying: "Would I do that? Absolutely."

The general's remarks exposed international skepticism over the American military build-up in the Middle East, a legacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq that was predicated on false intelligence. U.S. officials have to date not provided any evidence to back up claims of an increased Iranian threat even as an ally general took the extraordinary step of publicly challenging the Trump administration.

"No, there's been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria," said Maj. Gen. Chris Ghika, a senior officer in the U.S.-backed coalition fighting the Islamic State group. Ghika, speaking in a video conference from coalition headquarters in Baghdad, told reporters at the Pentagon that the coalition monitors the presence of Iranian-backed forces "along with a whole range of others because that's the environment we're in."

But he added, "There are a substantial number of militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and we don't see any increased threat from any of them at this stage."

Late in the day, in a rare public rebuttal of an allied military officer, U.S. Central Command said Ghika's remarks "run counter to the identified credible threats" from Iranian-backed forces in the Mideast. In a written statement, Central Command said the coalition in Baghdad has increased the alert level for all service members in Iraq and Syria.

"As a result, (the coalition) is now at a high level of alert as we continue to closely monitor credible and possibly imminent threats to U.S. forces in Iraq," the statement said.

At the White House, Trump, who has repeatedly argued for avoiding long-term conflicts in the Mideast, discounted a New York Times report that the U.S. has updated plans that could send up to 120,000 troops to counter Iran if it attacked American forces.

"Would I do that? Absolutely," he told reporters. "But we have not planned for that. Hopefully we're not going to have to plan for that. If we did that, we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that."

Reinforcing Trump's denial, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a joint news conference in Sochi with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, "We fundamentally do not seek war with Iran."

A Trump administration official said a recent small meeting of national security officials was not focused on a military response to Iran, but instead concentrated on a range of other policy options, including diplomacy and economic sanctions. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Lavrov said Pompeo told him that a potential deployment of 120,000 U.S. troops to the Mideast was only a "rumor." Lavrov said the international community needs to focus on diplomacy with Iran, including on the potentially explosive issue of Iran's nuclear program, which is constrained by a U.S.-brokered deal in 2015 that Trump has abandoned.

U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook told reporters traveling with Pompeo in Brussels that the secretary of state shared intelligence on Iran with allies since "Europe shares our concerns about stability in the Gulf and the Middle East." What the Europeans do not share, however, is Washington's more aggressive approach to Iran.

"We are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident, with an escalation that is unintended really on either side but ends with some kind of conflict," British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told reporters in Brussels.

"What we need is a period of calm to make sure that everyone understands what the other side is thinking," Hunt said.

Last week, U.S. officials said they had detected signs of Iranian preparations for potential attacks on U.S. forces and interests in the Mideast, but Washington has not spelled out that threat.

The U.S. has about 5,000 troops in Iraq and about 2,000 in Syria as part of the coalition campaign to defeat the Islamic State group there. It also has long had a variety of air and naval forces stationed in Bahrain, Qatar and elsewhere in the Gulf, partly to support military operations against IS and partly as a counter to Iranian influence.

Gen. Ghika's comments came amid dramatically heightened tensions in the Middle East. The U.S. in recent days has ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Gulf region, plus four B-52 bombers. It also is moving a Patriot air-defense missile battery to an undisclosed country in the area. As of Tuesday, the Lincoln and its strike group had passed through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea, but officials would not disclose their exact location.

Tensions rose another notch with reports Sunday that four commercial vessels anchored off the United Arab Emirates had been damaged by sabotage.

A U.S. military team was sent to the UAE to investigate, and one U.S. official said the initial assessment is that each ship has a 5- to 10-foot hole in it, near or just below the water line. The official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation, said the early interpretation is that the holes were caused by explosive charges.

The official on Tuesday acknowledged seeing some photographs of the damage to the ships, but those images have not been made public. The official also said that the team is continuing to conduct forensic testing on the ship damage and that U.S. leaders are still awaiting the final report. The team's initial assessment is that the damage was done by Iranian or Iranian-backed proxies, but they are still going through the evidence and have not yet reached a final conclusion, the official said.

Texto completo: Jerrod Carmichael's short, quiet documentary is streaming on HBO platforms. And Idris Elba's directorial debut hits Amazon.
What's Streaming
HOME VIDEOS Stream on HBO platforms. A quiet, cinéma-vérité documentary shot with a solitary film camera isn't the kind of project one would expect from a stand-up comic like Jerrod Carmichael. With "Home Videos," Carmichael presents 30 minutes of candid conversations between himself and some of the women in his life in his hometown, Winston-Salem, N.C. They touch on topics like blackness, feminism and relationships. The goal, Carmichael recently told The New York Times, was to have honest conversations. "No performance for the camera," he said. "Me and you, we're here. Let's see what happens."
WEED THE PEOPLE (2018) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In the 2008 documentary "The Business of Being Born," the filmmaker Abby Epstein dived into American motherhood and home childbirth. Her latest documentary, "Weed the People," also involves the very young; it tells of instances in which medical marijuana was used to fight pediatric cancer, making a case for further research and arguing that legal red tape is preventing potential medical breakthroughs.
KING OF THIEVES (2019) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Michael Caine, Tom Courtenay, Jim Broadbent and Ray Winstone star in this gray-haired crime caper. Based on the 2015 Hatton Garden heist, the movie follows a group of older ex-cons who plan to rob the vault of a London jewelry store. "Jokes about knee liniment, disability payments and insulin jabs pepper Joe Penhall's script," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times. "If you're in the right mood," she noted, "This will all go down as easily as a warm brew in an East End pub; otherwise, you'll begin to notice the sketchy plotting and slack pacing."
THE UNICORN (2019) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The actors and comedians Nicholas Rutherford and Lauren Lapkus play Malory and Caleb, a perennially engaged couple struggling to fully commit to marriage in this goofy comedy, directed by Robert Schwartzman ("Dreamland"). When they learn that the secret to Malory's parents' quarter-century of happy marriage is a penchant for threesomes, the couple embark on a mission to have one, for the sake of their relationship. Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times that the movie is "kept afloat solely by the likability of its two leads."
What's on TV
THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001) 8 p.m. on FXX. Among the parallels between Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy and "Game of Thrones" (swords, magic, Sean Bean) is this: Each series added more spectacle as the stories went on. After a brief prologue, this first installment of Jackson's trilogy begins quaintly, with a rosy-cheeked Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) reading beneath a tree.

Texto completo: President Trump is telling advisers and close allies that he has no intention of pulling back on his escalating trade war with China, arguing that clashing with Beijing is highly popular with his political base and will help him win reelection in 2020 regardless of any immediate economic pain.
Administration officials and outside Trump advisers said Tuesday that they do not expect him to shift his position significantly in coming days, saying he is determined to endure an intensifying showdown with Chinese President Xi Jinping despite turbulence in global markets.
Trump's defiance is rooted in decades of viewing the Chinese as economic villains and driven by his desire to fulfill a core promise from his 2016 campaign: that he would dramatically overhaul the U.S.-China relationship. The confrontation is also fueled by Trump's willingness to flout the norms of presidential behavior, including his suggestion on Tuesday that the Federal Reserve should assist his trade efforts by lowering interest rates.
"I don't see him crying uncle anytime soon," said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist who withdrew from consideration as a Trump Federal Reserve Board nominee amid an uproar. "It's a high-risk strategy, but it's not in his personality to back down. This goes back to what he said that first time he came down the escalator at Trump Tower."
Speaking to reporters Tuesday before boarding Marine One en route to Louisiana, Trump insisted that he is in a "very, very strong position" and called the stalled negotiations "a little squabble."
Trump cast the strength of the U.S. economy as leverage, saying, "We have all the advantage." And he reiterated his threat to expand the tariffs to cover virtually all Chinese imports, saying, "We're looking at it very strongly."
But as Trump expresses confidence, there have been tensions inside the White House, with some advisers uneasy with Trump's strident nationalism and firm belief in tariffs as economic weapons. The disagreements reflect broader distress within Republican circles about the president's sharp rhetoric and refusal to budge.
"I don't like directionally where it's going," said former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent investor.
"Tariffs are blunt instruments. They can inflict harm on competitors and be a source of leverage for negotiations," said former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who at times engaged in heated discussions in the Oval Office on trade. "They can also have significant consequences for global supply chains and domestic producers and consumers."
Trump has worked to contain his current advisers as the negotiations have unfolded and present a united front to the Chinese, who he believes are looking for weakness, according to multiple officials, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions. With Scaramucci, Porter and others who are alarmed now gone from the White House, Trump has found it easier to navigate his own administration and govern by his own instincts.
Trump was irritated on Sunday after National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow acknowledged on "Fox News Sunday" that American consumers end up paying for the administration's tariffs on Chinese imports, contradicting Trump's claim that the Chinese foot the bill, officials said.
"Trump called Larry, and they had it out," according to one White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly. Two other officials, however, described the conversation as cordial and said Trump and Kudlow went back and forth on trade, with Trump telling Kudlow several times to "not worry about it."
Republicans close to the president have said they've come to accept the president's hard line, even if they do not share it.
"The president believes tariffs are good economic policy. They are a tool to bring about trade," said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump confidant. "Trump has been consistent on trade for 30 years."
Graham said Trump often speaks about China in sweeping ways that underscore his unwillingness to flinch. Aides to the president say he comments about how many goods are made at low cost in China and how he believes China does not pay their workers or follow international laws. These people say he also bragged to aides about how much he has damaged the Chinese economy.
At a "Cocktails and Conversation" gathering of Republicans at the luxe 21 Club restaurant in New York City on Monday night, former Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn said he felt that the president might want to keep the debate over trade alive for the 2020 election because he believed it is a winning campaign issue, according to one attendee who was not authorized to discuss the meeting publicly.
Cohn, who has long been critical of tariffs, also worried aloud that the clash could do lasting damage to the nation's farming industries and said the Trump administration's effort to offset the effect of the trade war on U.S. farmers by supplying subsidies for them is not a sufficient approach if markets are lost, two attendees said. Cohn compared Trump's strategy to treating cancer with a Band-Aid, they said.
Still, Cohn said, Trump could win a second term on the strength of the U.S. economy. He added that the president could run on a "3-3-3" platform, meaning about 3 percent for unemployment, GDP growth and wage growth, two attendees said.
The event, which included wealthy political donors and other GOP power brokers, was organized by a firm that employs former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who also spoke there, according to three people familiar with the gathering.
When Cohn was in the administration, he and Trump would have loud, profane fights over tariffs, and Trump would sometimes tell him to stop arguing because Cohn wasn't going to change the president's mind, according to former aides.
Trump would acknowledge in private conversations that economists broadly say tariffs cause American consumers to pay higher prices, but he would add that "you can find an economist to say anything," in the words of one former aide who discussed the issue with him.
Dozens of U.S. companies have complained that Trump's earlier steel and aluminum tariffs drove up their costs and hurt more U.S. workers than they helped. But Trump does not see it that way and suspects companies are trying to blame him for troubles that began before he implemented tariffs, according to people familiar with the internal debate.
"For right now, it's what is going to get him reelected, because we have unemployment rates low and wages increasing," said Tom Bossert, a former Trump administration homeland security adviser. "Trump sees it as standing up for the American worker."
Some critics wonder if Trump's strategy is effective or more of an extemporaneous exercise without any clear end.
"China is a target that has to be confronted," said Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. "The question is whether this shock-and-awe strategy is a strategy at all. Will stronger tariffs lead to results? I'm not sure."
Trump's influential allies in the conservative media, such as Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, have been enthusiastically encouraging the president's headstrong tactics and disparaging his business-friendly critics.
Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist who once advised Trump on trade, said in an interview Tuesday that Trump's outlook on trade has not changed since they first met in 2010 at Trump Tower, and argued that it will be hard for any adviser to persuade him to change.
"Back then, he was watching Dobbs, reading the New York Times, following everything on China," Bannon said. "It's at the core of who he is."
But there is a widening gap between Trump and congressional Republicans, who on Tuesday expressed unhappiness with the president's refusal to measurably soften his position.
"The fact is it's Americans who are paying the price of these tariffs," Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) told reporters on Tuesday, citing economic data showing the levies have not had the intended effect of closing the trade gap with China or measurably hurting Chinese exports.
Asked if Trump understands this view, Toomey said, "I assume the president understands how this works. But you'd have to ask him why he comes to the conclusions he comes to." When pressed for further explanation, he declined and said he would "leave it at that."
Vice President Pence has quietly sought to allay senators' concerns over tariffs but has been unable to offer any meaningful concessions or promises, Senate GOP aides said this week. During a lunch with Republicans last week, Pence told senators he heard them when they berated the administration's tariffs, but he then asked them to stand with the president, without saying much else.

Texto completo: They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Parody is probably another one.
Hard on the heels of the record-breaking Broadway hit musical "Hamilton," there is "Spamilton: An American Parody."
Called "smart, silly and often convulsively funny" by the New York Times, "Spamilton" will have a summer-long run with the Pittsburgh CLO, from May 16 through Aug. 25 in the Greer Cabaret Theater.
The meta-musical was created by playwright and parodist Gerard Alessandrini, best known for "Forbidden Broadway," a long-running four-person cabaret send-up of Broadway musicals, show tunes, plots, characters, actors, directors and anything else even remotely related to the genre.
"Spamilton" offers more of the same, says New York-based music director Fred Barton, as the character of Alexander Hamilton tells the story of how actor-composer Lin-Manuel Miranda came to New York and created "Hamilton" -- while also parodying more Broadway productions and personalities.
Back to the beginning
Barton says he was in on both shows from the very beginning, and has been traveling back and forth from the Big Apple to Pittsburgh since February in preparation for the CLO production.
Barton was a young pianist in New York when his best friend asked him to play piano for a little two-person revue that would run for a couple of nights in "a little piano bar" called Palsson's Supper Club. He says he didn't think it would be worth his time but reluctantly agreed.
The second person involved turned out to be Alessandrini. The show itself was the rough draft of "Forbidden Broadway," first performed in January 1982 with Barton as co-creator/arranger/performer/pianist.
"(Alessandrini) just has a knack for writing parody. Tears were streaming down my face, I was laughing so hard at the lyrics," Barton says. "I'm glad I got off my high horse and agreed to do it."
Barton went on to work as an arranger, composer, conductor and more, on and off Broadway, in television, with symphonies and individual performers. His television work includes composing for "The Magic Schoolbus" and "Eureeka's Castle."
Out of the blue
Cut to 2016. Barton says, out of the blue, he got a call from Alessandrini, who needed a pianist for his new parody of "Hamilton." He asked if Barton knew of any young and hungry talents.
"I said, 'Gerard, I don't know who's out there -- and I'll do it myself,'" he says.
"Seven days later, we were doing it in front of an audience," he says. "We were in the exact same club, all coming back to our roots, and it was like lightning strikes twice."
"Spamilton" opened Sept. 8, 2016, at New York's Triad Theatre. The original 18-performance run was extended through May 28, 2017.
Since then, it's played in various other theaters and cities, including Chicago and London.
"Pittsburgh is the sixth production we've put together, and every time it just gets better," Barton says.
'Genius' choreography
One thing "Spamilton" has that sets it above other song-and-dance revues, Barton says, is a "genius choreographer" in Gerry McIntyre: "He's one of the few I've seen who can get laughs from just the choreography alone."
Making his Pittsburgh CLO debut as Lin-Manuel Miranda is New York-based T.J. Newton, who played Usnavi in Pittsburgh Musical Theatre's recent production of Miranda's "In the Heights."
Also making their CLO debuts are leads Justin Lonesome (Ben Franklin and George Washington) and Tru Verret-Fleming (Leslie Odom Jr. and Aaron Burr). Other cast members are Erin Ramirez (leading ladies), LaTrea Rembert (Daveed Diggs), Austin Rivers (swing), Jessica Val Ortiz (swing) and Nick Stamatakis, assistant music director who will also portray King George III.

Rich Lowry: There are no Trump mysteries left to find

Texto completo: The surprise about the big New York Times story on Donald Trump’s tax returns is that there are no real surprises.
Trump’s taxes have been an obsession of the left since he, in violation of a long-standing norm, reneged on his promise to release his returns during the 2016 campaign.
Pieces were written urging some brave whistleblower to come forward with them, and Democrats counted as one of the advantages of taking the House that they could demand Trump’s returns. The dispute resulting from the administration’s refusal to turn them over is now probably headed to the Supreme Court.
All the while, the expectation, or at least the suspicion, was that the returns contained some awful secret, perhaps evidence that he is a tool of the Russians.
And here, The New York Times has obtained Trump’s tax information spanning a decade from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s, and the revelation is that he wasn’t doing as well as he said in public and lost a boatload of money in a period that nearly destroyed him. In other words, exactly what anyone paying any attention would have expected.
Yes, the amount of the reported loss, $1.17 billion, is remarkable (although inflated for tax purposes), and some of the details memorable.
Trump doesn’t like having all the particulars on the record to be discussed and mocked, but can anyone say that they are surprised?
Trump himself, the Washington Examiner notes, talked about his precarious financial state in this period on the first episode of “The Apprentice.” In fact, he may have exaggerated, saying that he had been “billions of dollars” in debt.
As for Trump’s use of tax loopholes, he said in a debate with Hillary Clinton that if he didn’t owe any tax liability, that made him “smart.”
There really are no Trump mysteries. His flaws aren’t hidden away. He often attests to them himself, or demonstrates them publicly. For someone who cares so much about his image, and so assiduously crafts it, he’s a relative open book.
No blockbuster report has more than a passing effect because each dispatch is, ultimately, another dot in a pointillist portrait of the president that was largely completed long ago.
This is also why the hope that we are one investigation, tax return or subpoena away from the revelation that will finally bring Trump down — or even make a difference — is almost certainly forlorn.
Obviously, it was news that he had paid off a porn star during the presidential campaign, and highly embarrassing. This is why Trump denied it for so long. But he’d already told us about his womanizing in his own words, often on “The Howard Stern Show.”
Likewise, the most blameworthy conduct regarding Russia’s election interference in 2016 was out in the open — the Trump campaign was happy to derive any possible advantage from the WikiLeaks disclosures, and Trump tried to deny the obvious Russian involvement.
We didn’t need a 400-page special counsel report to break that news.
Even some of Trump’s alleged obstruction, which you’d expect to involve back-channel scheming (and there was certainly that), was out in the open.
He pressured Jeff Sessions in public to un-recuse. He publicly called Michael Cohen a rat. He told Lester Holt on a TV news broadcast that he fired James Comey because of the Russia investigation (specifically that it didn’t have anything to do with him). And he’s made no secret that he yearns for an attorney general who will protect him.
You can add lurid details to this basic picture, and Mueller did, but it’s hard to find a game-changer.
None of this is to defend or excuse Trump’s business practices, or his conduct in office. It is merely to say that he’s an extravagantly known quantity, and will likely win or lose in 2020 based on what we already know rather than the fruits of further investigation and fact-finding.

CENTER-ED ON THE ARTS

Texto completo: As sunlight glistens off the smooth, stone surfaces of Lincoln Center's Josie Robertson Plaza on a recent warm afternoon, visitors meander about, some heading for a show while others, including the occasional child whirring by on a tiny scooter, glide along one of the great open spaces in New York.
What they all may not realize is that not too many feet away, the tip of a ceremonial shovel was pushed into the soil by President Dwight Eisenhower on May 14, 1959, forever changing the landscape and signaling the start of a new era for several acres of the Upper West Side.
With construction phases completed years ago - including a 2009 redesign of the popular Revson Fountain, the centerpiece of the plaza - many concertgoers, visitors and local residents might feel as if the expanse had always been here.
"The intent was that the plazas at Lincoln Center be great public spaces, akin to the piazzas and plazas in Italian and other European cities," said Andrew Scott Dolkart, professor of historic preservation at the Columbia University School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. "The fact that the main plaza is open at one end and at all corners permits a dynamic flow of people, and the secondary plaza with the fountain also creates multiple streams of pedestrian traffic and seating. I think that these have been a great success and at many times of the day are among the most dynamic sites in New York."
The Lincoln Center of today, however, was born amid conceptual doubt and social consternation.
The project was the crown-jewel of then-Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr.'s Committee on Slum Clearance, which was overseen by master builder Robert Moses, according to a New York Times article from Dec. 2017.
The "urban renewal" plan, which included educational, commercial and residential facilities, ultimately resulted in the demolition of 18 Upper West Side blocks, according to the Times. Some 800 businesses and 7,000 families were displaced as a result of the project, and promised relocation assistance was never received by those most in need, including previous residents who were mostly black and Hispanic.
Along with the neighborhood, Lincoln Center itself has morphed over time.
"To me, one of the great losses in the city is Philip Johnson's original fountain in the center of the plaza, with its dancing water (which had been broken for many years before the entire piece was removed)," Dolkart said in an email.
He added that although the new fountain is dramatic, the water feature is "not in scale with the open space or buildings, and at the slightest breeze it makes the rim too wet to sit on. This is a big change since people always sat on the very comfortable Johnson rim."
"On the other hand, the sinking of the road at the front of the plaza has been a great improvement, making access more gracious (marred somewhat by the barrier blocks recently installed)," Dokart said. 
One need not spend more than a few moments on a sunny day - or for that matter even a cold, drizzly day - to see hundreds crisscrossing the plaza, sometimes hustling between the buildings, but often slowing down a little, maybe even stopping to look up at the towering Chagall murals just behind the Metropolitan Opera House front windows.
As one passes, it's impossible not to realize what is above the entire plaza: space, open space, certainly to be cherished for another 60 years.

Texto completo: The band Vampire Weekend went six years without releasing an album, but returned to exactly where it left off: No. 1.
"Father of the Bride" (Columbia Records), the group's fourth LP and first not on the label XL Recordings, debuts atop the Billboard album chart this week with 138,000 album equivalent units, including 119,000 in sales and 23 million song streams, according to Nielsen. Those numbers mark the best commercial performance for a rock record this year.
Vampire Weekend, which began as a four-piece at Columbia University and now functions as the Los Angeles-based project of the frontman Ezra Koenig, reached No. 1 with its previous two releases -- "Modern Vampires of the City" in 2013 and "Contra" in 2010. And while the musical landscape has shifted in the years since, with listeners turning increasingly to digital streaming platforms where rock music has mostly been left behind, the band's reach has remained largely the same: "Contra" had first-week sales of 124,000 copies, followed by a debut of 134,000 for "Modern Vampires of the City."
The critic Jon Pareles wrote of "Father of the Bride" in The New York Times: "It's full of light-fingered guitars, perky tempos, winsome vocals and sunny, major-key choruses laced with poppy la-las and ooh-oohs. But that sound is definitely not to be trusted."
The only other new release to crack the Top 15 was PnB Rock's "TrapStar Turnt PopStar" (Atlantic), which totaled 42,000 units, including 55 million streams, and landed at No. 4.
The rest of the Top 5 consists of chart-toppers from earlier this year: Billie Eilish's "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" (Darkroom/Interscope) is No. 2, largely thanks to 75 million streams; "Free Spirit" (RCA) by Khalid is No. 3 with 57 million streams; and Ariana Grande's "Thank U, Next" (Republic) is No. 5 with 45 million streams. Outside of Vampire Weekend, no album in the Top 5 tallied more than 14,000 in traditional sales.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Losing income tax privacy is a real danger: Ron Paul

Texto completo: Last week the New York Times published some of President Trump’s 1980s and 1990s tax return information.
The information detailed President Trump’s financial difficulties during that time. While you would not know it from reading some media reports, this is old news. In fact, President Trump openly discussed his financial difficulties on his popular reality television show.
What should be of great concern is the possibility that the person who leaked the returns — who the paper says has legal access to President Trump’s tax records — is an IRS employee seeking to undermine the president. This would hardly be the first time an IRS employee has leaked confidential information because he disagreed with the taxpayer’s politics. In 2014 the agency had to pay the National Organization for Marriage $50,000 dollars after an IRS employee gave names of the group’s donors to the group’s opponents.
In 2014-2017, my Campaign for Liberty group was repeatedly threatened by the IRS because it refused to give the agency the names of and other information about its top supporters. Fortunately, the IRS rescinded the regulation forcing groups like Campaign for Liberty to violate supporters’ privacy or face legal penalties. However, campaign finance reform legislation that recently passed in the House of Representatives would require the IRS to resume collecting this information, and the New York attorney general is suing the IRS to force the agency to reinstate the regulation.
The right of groups like Campaign for Liberty to protect their supporters’ privacy was upheld by the Supreme Court in NAACP v. Alabama. As Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, “Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.”
Traditionally, presidents have used the IRS to harass their political opponents instead of presidents’ opponents using the IRS against them. Franklin Roosevelt audited people critical of the New Deal and supportive of the America First movement. Lyndon Johnson ordered audits of opponents, and John Kennedy shared tax return information with Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.
During the Obama administration, the IRS targeted groups opposing Obamacare. The agency went after anti-Iraq War groups during the George W. Bush years.
If the Times did obtain Trump’s tax returns information from an IRS employee, that employee is not in the same category as whistleblowers like Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning who exposed government wrongdoing. The leaker or leakers of President Trump’s information are releasing private tax information.
The IRS regularly violates the civil liberties of taxpayers. In fact, the income tax system forcing taxpayers to reveal potentially incriminating information on their tax returns violates the principles of a free society. Americans’ liberty and prosperity will never be secure until Congress repeals two great mistakes of 1913: the income tax and the Federal Reserve.
Dr. Ron Paul is a former member of the House of Representatives. This article was written for and published by the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON.— Teresa Todd recuerda bien cuando se detuvo en una zona desértica en Texas a ayudar a tres hermanos que habían sido abandonados por su grupo . Su gesto de buena samaritana le costó una breve detención, pero ahora lucha para que el Congreso modifique las leyes y no castigue a personas que rescaten a migrantes .
Todd es abogada de la ciudad fronteriza de Marfa y del condado de Jeff Davis, en Texas, situados en un altiplano del desierto chihuahuense.
Durante una noche fría en febrero pasado se detuvo a ayudar a tres jóvenes salvadoreños que fueron abandonados por su grupo porque la más joven, Esmeralda, se enfermó y no podían avanzar .
En entrevista telefónica con Noticias Telemundo, Todd explicó este lunes que sólo pensó en su hijo menor cuando vio las figuras pidiendo auxilio en un lugar tan aislado y obscuro, y su instinto materno la obligó a actuar .
“Creo que paré en parte porque soy madre de dos adolescentes, de 17 y 15 años, y el joven que corrió delante de mi coche era casi del mismo tamaño que mi hijo menor. Les pedí que se subieran a mi coche, y poco después llegó la Patrulla Fronteriza y me advirtió de que podrían enjuiciarme ” por transportar a inmigrantes indocumentados, explicó.
Todd pasó 45 minutos en una celda y un total de tres horas en detención. Varios días después, agentes federales, con orden de cateo en mano, llegaron a la alcaldía a confiscarle su teléfono. Se lo devolvieron 53 días después, causando enormes interrupciones en su trabajo.
“Mucha gente se molestó conmigo porque no les devolvía las llamadas, y en ese teléfono tengo mucha información privilegiada de mis clientes. Como abogada, claro, me causó muchos problemas”, se quejó Todd, cuyo caso salió a luz pública el viernes pasado en un artículo del diario The New York Times.
Desde entonces, su oficina no deja de recibir llamadas, y en las redes sociales la mayoría de los comentarios son para elogiar y respaldarla.
Los tres jóvenes, Carlos, Francisco y Esmeralda, formaban parte de un grupo de diez personas cuando cruzaron el Río Bravo. Al parecer, llevaban seis días caminando y ya habían agotado sus raciones de comida y agua cuando Esmeralda, de 18 años, presentó graves síntomas de deshidratación.
Todos siguen bajo custodia de la Oficina de Inmigración y Aduanas, aún cuando han solicitado asilo. Su caso se complica porque los dos hermanos presuntamente firmaron documentos que, según ICE, autorizan su “autodeportación” .
Dan Domínguez, alguacil del Condado Presidio, cercano a Marfa, ha dicho a la prensa que, a su juicio, Todd debería ser sometida a juicio porque, sin importar su gesto humanitario, “la ley es la ley” .
Es que, según el código penal, las autoridades federales pueden presentar cargos criminales contra personas que, a sabiendas, intenten transportar a inmigrantes indocumentados más allá de los puntos fronterizos, los oculten u ofrezcan albergue.
Una vez declaradas culpables, esas personas suelen afrontar una multa y sentencia carcelaria .
Según datos oficiales, entre 2015 y 2018, el número de personas acusadas por contrabando y dar refugio a inmigrantes indocumentados aumentó en casi un tercio, de 3,441 a 4,532 .
En abril de 2017, bajo el entonces fiscal general, Jeff Sessions, la Administración Trump instruyó a los fiscales en todo EEUU a que dieran máxima prioridad a enjuiciar a quienes faciliten los cruces ilegales, o trasladen y den albergue a al menos tres migrantes indocumentados.
Otros casos similares al incidente con Todd en la franja fronteriza también han tenido amplia cobertura mediática, como el de activistas en Arizona, del grupo “No More Deaths/No Más Muertes”, que en enero pasado fueron condenados por proveer agua y comida a migrantes en zonas desérticas.
En California, activistas del grupo “Border Angels”, que desde hace 20 años dejan ropa, comida y bidones de agua para los migrantes en el desierto, han sido objeto de críticas de grupos anti-inmigrantes.
Mientras Todd presiona para que el Congreso modifique las leyes migratorias, la abogada expresó esperanza en que los jóvenes que atendió aquella noche puedan obtener asilo.
Cuando Todd se enteró de que Francisco “agradeció a Dios primero, y después a esa señora” que los rescató de una muerte casi segura, la abogada no hizo más que ponerse a llorar , dijo.
“Tengo dos trabajos y dos hijos, pero estoy intentando hacer todo lo que pueda por ayudar en esto… nuestro tiempo juntos fue muy breve esa noche, pero me conmueve mucho su caso y espero que consigan asilo para quedarse en EEUU, porque está claro que sus vidas correrían peligro si son devueltos” a El Salvador, puntualizó Todd.

Dispatches from the sorry state of American discourse

Texto completo: “This just in,” as we say in the news business.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher recently called Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden to complain about President Donald Trump.
This is indeed big news, mainly because Thatcher has been dead for six years.
But if the former vice president says he spoke to Thatcher, who am I to question?
Biden later corrected himself and said he was talking about current Prime Minister Theresa May, who is very much alive. Biden called the mistake a “Freudian slip,” which is also kind of a strange thing to say.
Ironically enough, Biden made the Thatcher comment during a fundraiser in South Carolina during which he called Trump a clown.
Trump supporters pounced on the Thatcher reference because they like to portray Biden as a sort of inappropriate, forgetful uncle who shows up every Thanksgiving and, after he leaves, you’re thankful you don’t have to see him for another year.
But, never to be outdone, Trump returned the favor and gave the left, and the media, yet another reason to gesticulate.
Trump often finds a way to insinuate himself into news events that have absolutely nothing to do with him.
He did it with the Notre Dame Cathedral fire when he offered firefighters some unsolicited advice on how to extinguish the blaze.
Last Sunday, the topic was the controversial finish of the Kentucky Derby. The horse that crossed the line first was disqualified for obstructing the path of other horses.
Trump tweeted: “The Kentuky Derby decision was not a good one. It was a rough & tumble race on a wet and sloppy track, actually, a beautiful thing to watch. Only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur. The best horse did NOT win the Kentucky Derby — not even close!?”
The media immediately noticed both the “political correctness” reference and the lack of a “c” in the first Kentucky. The latter was an honest mistake that Trump later corrected. Nevertheless, the tweet became fodder — as most of Trump’s tweets do — for The New York Times and CNN, among others.
“It’s about the man behind the tweet. A man who also happens to be the leader of the free world,” wrote CNN’s Chris Cillizza in a full-blown “analysis” of the tweet.
I don’t know what Trump meant by “political correctness” but I know I spent way too much time thinking about it. Was the winning horse an illegal immigrant? Was he banned from speaking on a college campus? Did he wear a MAGA hat to the Derby?
(I told you I spent too much time thinking about it.)
Democrats, your serve.
New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez enjoys sharing videos of herself that make her look clueless. Ocasio-Cortez, keep in mind, is the author of the Green New Deal, which would cost somewhere between $51 trillion and $93 trillion and features a variety of unrealistic goals including eliminating fossil fuel use in 12 years and rendering air travel unnecessary.
But in the short term, she has bigger fish to fry — or dispose of, as the case may be.
Last week, she posted a video on Instagram in which she reveals a discovery in her new apartment.
Behold! She gives you ... the garbage disposal.
“OK everyone, I need your help,” she says in the video, “because I just moved into this apartment a few months ago and I just flipped a switch and it made that noise and it scared the daylights out of me. I am told this is a garbage disposal. ... I’ve never seen a garbage disposal. I never had one in any place I’ve ever lived.”
Say what you will about Trump, but the man knows a garbage disposal when he sees one.
Republicans, back to you.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, recently called the presidential candidacy of Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet a “Seinfeld campaign — about nothing.”
The reference to the popular sitcom did not escape the notice of one of its stars, Jason Alexander, aka George Costanza, who tweeted, “I’ve met Bennett. He is a great man and real choice for POTUS. As for Cruz — the jerk store called and they’re running out of you.”
At this point, you might be wondering what happened to political discourse in this country.
Here’s more breaking news: This is it.

Texto completo: Tours: The easiest way is to go through a travel company. A local option is ROW Adventures. Although started as a whitewater river rafting company in Idaho, ROW now takes people across the globe, including Cuba. Visit cubaunbound.com for more information.
It's also possible to go to Cuba via cruise ship or a host of other travel agencies.
Flights: United, American, Delta, Frontier, Alaska and JetBlue all fly to Cuba. Many flights require a long layover on the East Coast.
Solo travel: It is possible to go to Cuba on your own. Your travel must fall into one of 12 types of travel deemed acceptable by the U.S. government: family visits; official government business; journalistic activity; professional research and professional meetings; educational activities; religious activities; performances; support for the Cuban people; humanitarian projects; activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes; exportation, importation, or transmission of information or informational materials; and certain authorized export transactions, according to the U.S. Embassy.
When solo traveling to Cuba the airline will ask what category you're traveling under.
The U.S. government has banned U.S. citizens from spending money at government run shops, restaurants or hotels.
Violating these rules can, technically, lead to a $250,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison. However, the New York Times reports that no one has paid these fines or gone to jail.
Visa requirements: The Cuban government requires a Cuban tourist card to enter the country. The cards, which are valid for 30 days, can be purchased at the airport prior to leaving the U.S.
Accommodations: All hotels in Cuba are owned by the Cuban government, and thus Americans are not allowed to stay in them.
Honestly, that's for the best. There is an extensive network of Casa Particulars, or private homes that rent rooms, like Airbnb. It's easy to show up in a new town and find a Casa Particular. Look for the distinctive black stick drawing of a home posted on the front of participating homes. Or, you can book ahead of time using Airbnb or by visiting casaparticular.com.
Language: English is relatively common in Havana, especially in touristy places. However, English is not widely spoken outside of Havana. In my experience, Cubans are very gracious with stumbling foreigners trying to dredge up high school Spanish. Sign language, translation apps on smartphones and the occasional shared word will get you by. Still, be prepared to be confused at times.
Food: Lots of meat, seafood, rice and beans. The food is excellent. Although it could be hard to travel in Cuba as a vegan. For vegans going to Cuba check out The Nomadic Vegan blog at thenomadicvegan.com/vegan-cuba/.
Money: There are two types of currency in Cuba. The Cuban peso, which the Cubans use and the Cuban convertible peso, also called the CUC, which is for tourists. The convertible peso is roughly equal to one U.S. dollar.
American changing U.S. dollars to CUCs pay a 10% fee. If possible, change American dollars to Euros before going to Cuba to avoid this fee.
Americans are able to withdraw money from ATMs in Cuba and use some credit and debit cards. However, cash is still king in Cuba and many places don't have card capabilities.
The politics: Recently the Trump Administration announced a "crackdown" on Cuba and hinted at banning or severely limiting travel to the island nation. It's not clear if this will actually happen and as of yet nothing has changed in regards to traveling to Cuba. But, keep an eye on the situation as it could change.

Texto completo: When Google rolled out its ad campaign for the Pixel 2 phone in 2017, the TV commercial followed a familiar formula.
There were dizzying close-up shots of the phone. A funky tune full of big-band jazz horns. And, of course, excerpts from positive reviews, similar to what you'd see on a movie poster or book sleeve.
One name stood out alongside quotes from the New York Times and Wired: Marques Brownlee.
His name may have been unfamiliar to most of the people watching the commercial, but on YouTube, he's the name when it comes to tech reviews.
With more than 8.5 million subscribers and 1.2 billion views, Brownlee has four times as many YouTube subscribers as the Times.
In some ways, Brownlee's trajectory mirrors YouTube's. He started reviewing tech gadgets at 15 when his early videos were lo-fi vlogs of him speaking directly at his laptop camera in his room. Now he has several full-time staffers helping him shoot and edit high-quality video from a dedicated studio. In the past year, he published close to 100 videos, including interviews with Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Brownlee occupies an enviable position within YouTube's tech review space: He has the independence and autonomy of an outsider, but with insider access.
By sheer numbers, he's a bigger brand than any mainstream media outlet. But by virtue of having built his platform himself, he fits comfortably within the broader framework of the community. In that sense, he's the embodiment of the average YouTuber's most ambitious daydream.
With this reach also comes significant responsibility and, because Brownlee is in many ways his own boss, he ultimately decides where to draw ethical lines.
In a 2018 interview, Recode's Peter Kafka asked Brownlee if tech companies treat him as press or as an influencer.
"I'd say they treat us as press," Brownlee said. "Might say because of my place where I was one of the first YouTubers to get invited and just kind of looped in along with the rest of press at a lot of these things, I got to observe how they work with press."
Kafka asked if a company has offered to pay him directly, or offered to fly him somewhere. Brownlee said companies will cover his flight and hotel if they need to bring him to a remote place.
When asked if he's OK with that, Brownlee responded, "I'm cool with that, that's great, but if it's some sort of a device review or analysis then that has to stop there."
In April, Brownlee spoke to The Post's Teddy Amenabar about the balancing act of providing critical reviews while working with the companies to test the latest products.
"I'm not changing any of my opinions or what I'm saying about a product in a video based on my relationship with the company," Brownlee said. "When they release a product, my job is to be honest and deliver what people want to see and what people need to hear."
Brownlee doesn't call himself a journalist, but he seems to value a similar kind of editorial independence that maintains the trust of his growing audience.
Still, traditional media organizations tend to have stricter rules against accepting travel or lodging from a company. The Washington Post's policy, for instance, states that employees must pay their own way, and that includes not accepting gifts or free trips.
Brownlee also isn't shy with his enthusiasm for certain companies, such as Tesla. When he interviewed Musk, the tone was more enthusiastic than journalistic, especially compared to what Musk would face with an average journalist or conference panel. That shouldn't come as a shock, considering Brownlee was a finalist in a Tesla contest for fan-made ads in 2017 - something you wouldn't find many journalists entering.
To anyone watching a product review on YouTube, maybe that distinction doesn't matter, but it's worth considering the broader implications of that power dynamic, especially when it involves some of the most powerful companies in the world.
Apple, a notoriously challenging company for journalists to cover, highlighted this dynamic in the way it allowed media access to the iPhone X ahead of its 2017 release.
The company decided to change the way it handles reviews of its products by not standardizing the amount of time tech reviewers could spend with the product, or when the reviews could be published.
Not all media organizations were able to test it, and even for those who did, they were mostly beaten to the punch by several YouTubers (along with Popular Science), who were given earlier access and publish dates.
Brownlee, who was not one of those YouTubers, also noticed similarities across those early YouTube reviews.
"[The videos had] all the same talking points, all the same omissions, so you kind of get the idea that this is a genre video, that Apple is curating in a small scale, and it feels like an experiment because it's so new to them," Brownlee told Kafka.
That gave Apple more control over the first reviews that would be published on YouTube. For a tech company trying to limit the potential for negative reviews, it makes business sense. And in this case, since the other reviews were eventually published, you could argue that the impact to the average consumer was negligible.
But it doesn't take a lot of imagination to project a few years into the future and see a scenario in which the access could be far more limited as tech companies attempt to exert more influence on the review process.
For the most part, Brownlee seems to understand the delicate balance between reviewer and multibillion-dollar tech company when it comes to reviewing products.
As tech YouTube continues to grow, and the traditional media shrinks in relative size and influence, it will be up to the next generation of YouTube reviewers to determine the value of editorial independence.
And if the power continues to shift toward the tech giants, consumers will ultimately pay the price.

The nature of nurturing

Texto completo: Mothers' Day can be bittersweet. ∙ For those who have lost their mothers, this day can be weighted with emotional memories, both good and bad. ∙ Those who still have their moms and who are blessed with being a mom, know there's nothing like a mother's love. ∙ As we celebrate this upcoming Mother's Day, I want to discuss the positive impact a mother's nurturing has on the outcome of a child. ∙ It's a given, mothers want what's best for their children; though occasionally, what is perceived as "best" in the mother's eyes can also have a reverse impact on the child's emotional and behavioral disposition.
As an example, mothers (and parents in general) focus on the importance of their child's academic performance; though education is important and does set the stage for future opportunities, there are other attributes to consider.
A child who is taught to manage their emotions is two times more likely to become successful in life.
In addition, children with good self-control and reduced compulsivity are less likely to have behavioral problems, drink, take drugs or end up in jail.
Furthermore, a mother's tone while speaking to her child also affects the brain's structural development.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Joan Luby from the Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, compared the interaction and development of two separate groups of 3- and 4-year-old children.
The first group hosted extremely nurturing and interactive mothers, while the second group had mothers with less or non-nurturing attributes.
After four years of research, the children who had considerable amounts of nurturing and guidance developed a 10 percent larger hippocampus on MRI brain scan studies.
The hippocampus, located in the center of the brain, directs bodily functions, controls learning and memory, while also supporting the body's response to emotional stress.
A subsequent study conducted by Dr. Akemi Tomado, a child mental health researcher in Japan, found less developed gray matter in the brains of children who had been verbally abused.
Gray matter, a major component in the brain, controls emotions, attention span and decision-making.
Children whose parents frequently yell and repeatedly state the children were "bad" exhibited lower self-esteem.
Typically, parents who use strong but directly negative language toward children believe they are making their child more responsible and compliant; research shows that parental sarcasm and threats inadvertently make children feel guilty, unloved and inferior.
This poor self-perception can lead to depression and/or anxiety in children.
So, what's the best approach in nurturing your child? Disciplining your child, teaching your child? What's the best way to communicate while trying to teach them right from wrong?
Stay calm, model good behavior. Recognize your emotions. Never try to discipline a child when you are angry.
Seek professional help when needed to better handle parent/child issues.
Don't suppress child's feelings. Allow the child to express his or her emotions such as crying, but teach the child to define behavior with a word.
For example, you state: "You are frustrated your brother took your toy but hitting your brother is never OK."
Feelings are what they are. Children should own their feelings, but outbursts caused by feelings are not good and will get them into trouble.
Have empathy for your child. Let your child know you are listening. As an example, say, "I understand you are angry, you want to yell and scream, please know I'm here if you need me."
You are not agreeing with the behavior but stating you do understand it.
It's important to note, screaming at a yelling child only makes the yelling louder as he or she wants to be heard.
Remember, if you both are yelling, no one is listening.
Problem solve. Once their anger dissipates, children need guidance to help problem solve.
A mother could say, "Next time, when you become angry, how could you behave differently?"
When the child responds with a different solution, answer: "If you do that instead, what do you think would happen next time?"
This will build the child's self-esteem and improve inappropriate responses over time. Always watch for good behavior and praise that behavior.
Listen. Make sure when communicating with children they have your undivided attention. No phones allowed
If you don't give them undivided attention, your child will seek help elsewhere or worse, stop talking to you altogether, while internalizing stress.
Avoid pacifying bad behavior. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents against using technology to pacify an unruly child as this method does not allow the child to learn to regulate his or her emotions.
Seek help from a pediatric healthcare professional when needed.
Some children need an evaluation to rule out autism, developmental delay, anxiety, ADD or ADHD. Sometimes a formal behavior modification program can be instituted to encourage good behavior and build self-esteem.
Our job as mothers is to nurture our children to help them find their unique gifts, as they all possess them.
As New York Times best-selling author, Dr. Wendy Mogel, states, "Try to see your child as a seed that came in a packet without a label. Your job is to provide the right environment and nutrients, while also pulling out the weeds. You can't decide what kind of flower you'll get, or in which season it will bloom."

Texto completo: Harvard College is removing a faculty dean who drew controversy for deciding to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein at his rape trial this fall.
Ronald Sullivan mugshot
Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana said Saturday he would not renew the appointments of law professor Ronald Sullivan and his wife, Stephanie Robinson, as faculty deans when their terms end on June 30.
Students who lived in Harvard’s Winthrop House, the undergraduate student residence that Sullivan supervises — and where he also lives — had demanded he be removed from his job because of his work for Weinstein.
Harvard administrators conducted a “climate review” of Winthrop House in response to the complaints from students.
“The concerns expressed have been serious and numerous," Khurana wrote in an email to students and faculty, obtained by the New York Times. "The actions that have been taken to improve the climate have been ineffective, and the noticeable lack of faculty dean presence during critical moments has further deteriorated the climate in the house. I have concluded that the situation in the house is untenable.”
Sullivan and his wife were the first black faculty deans in Harvard’s history.

Reading Thrives in the Land of Bourbon

Texto completo: LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- To outsiders, Kentucky's largest city may be best known for its active bourbon distilleries, a baseball bat factory, famous fried chicken and a certain horse race run the first Saturday in May, but just ask someone there where to buy a book. "Carmichael's," said one longtime resident, "is a Louisville institution."
The year 2019 has already been a big one for Carmichael's Bookstore. The city's oldest independent bookseller just celebrated its 41st birthday in April. But in January, Carol Besse and Michael Boggs, the couple who founded the store in 1978, officially passed on ownership to the next generation: their daughter, Miranda Blankenship, and niece, Kelly Estep.
Both Blankenship, 37, and Estep, 44, grew up working in the store. Despite having parents as booksellers, Blankenship didn't jump right into the family business at first, going off to study in criminal justice in college. "I honestly kind of rebelled away in the early days," she said, but eventually rejoined the staff after realizing she enjoyed helping people find the right book, whether offering suggested reads or tracking down the right title based on a half-remembered description. "Every day here is different. I realized I didn't want to sit behind a desk all day," she said.
Estep's mother (Besse's sister) has been a longtime Carmichael's employee and Estep herself has been working at the store on and off since she was 14, dusting shelves and learning the fundamentals of the retail business at an early age. "Although we are new owners and we're still fairly young, we have a lot of experience and that's a good thing," said Estep.
Established in a city that still makes a lot of its own stuff, Carmichael's Bookstore -- now expanded to two locations and a children's shop -- has a reputation for knowledgeable employees, community involvement and strong support of area authors. "I think the 'buy local' movement is thriving here in Louisville and I think it's growing across the country," said Blankenship.
The older Carmichael's Bookstore at 1295 Bardstown Road recently had a growth spurt as well. Last fall, the store expanded into the space left by an adjacent Heine Brothers' coffee shop that moved across the street. Even with the additional square footage, the Bardstown Road store is still packed with a wide selection of new books, magazines, greeting cards and literary-themed gift items like T-shirts, tote bags, buttons and fabric Sylvia Plath and Zora Neale Hurston dolls.
The store windows are papered with posters advertising the busy Carmichael's events calendar, which includes several author appearances and a book club gathering each month -- usually held over at the larger store at 2720 Frankfort Avenue. The schedule has also included poetry readings, a watch party for "The Great American Read" series on PBS, a musician's book-and-album signing at a nearby record store and chats with children's books illustrators.
"People are craving some of that nondigital world and bookstores are providing that, but we also have to make sure we're modernizing and keeping up with trends," said Estep. Carmichael's Bookstore now programs about 250 events a year in its shops and around town.

For young readers, Carmichael's Kids (at 1313 Bardstown Road) has a healthy selection of children's books, toys and gifts. One of the store's picture windows, furnished with pillows and a large stuffed Clifford the Big Red Dog, serves as a "book nook" for in-house sampling. "We do two 'story times' a week," said Blankenship, who said the company also coordinates author readings and book fairs at schools.
Located along streets dotted with restaurants and other small businesses, the Carmichael's stores have a relaxed, neighborhood feel about them that appeals to the serious book browser out for a morning stroll -- or the occasional bus full of tourists spilling out to go shopping. "We've always been supported by the community," said Blankenship. "We were one of the founding members of our local independent business alliance."
Taking over a long-established family enterprise gives the new owners a chance to put their own stamp on the stores, but they say they don't have major plans to change a lot of things. "We appreciate and what has obviously been a successful way of doing business for 40 years," Estep said, "and we think about how we can bring that forward with us and our generation."
While the founders have largely retired, they haven't completely stepped away from the family business, whether it be consulting or something more hands-on. As Blankenship noted, "my dad will pick up shifts if we need coverage."

Texto completo: "I'm not going to let them bully me out of reporting," said Tim Pool after recording an antifa protest where angry activists cursed at him. There might have been violence, but antifa's "de-escalation team" protected him, he says.
That surprised me. "Antifa has a de-escalation team?"
"They have people who try and make sure nobody from their side starts it -- because cameras are rolling," he answered.
Pool is part of the new media that now cover stories the mainstream media often miss.
Pool considers himself a man of the left. He supported Bernie Sanders and once worked for Vice. But now he often finds himself criticizing his fellow leftists.
"This really strange faction of people on the left are saying ridiculous things," he says. "They're helping Donald Trump."
Trump probably does gain support when people watch street protests turn violent.
Pool won new followers with his coverage of the Washington, D.C., conflict between a Native American protester and Covington, Ky., high school teens wearing Trump hats, including one who looked like he was smirking.
"All these big news outlets, even The Washington Post, CNN, they immediately made the assumption, 'He must be a racist sneering at this Native American man'," Pool says. "I didn't make that assumption. ... I just see a guy banging a drum and a kid with a weird look on his face."
Pool and Reason TV's Robby Soave were the rare journalists who bothered to examine more of the videos.
"The initial narrative that we heard from the activists was that this kid got in this man's face. ... It's actually the other way around," Pool says. "No one else watched the video."
No one? Major news outlets said the student was racist without ever examining the full video?
"Here's what happens," Pool explains. "One left-wing journalist says, 'Look at this racist!' His buddy sees it and says, 'Wow, look at this racist.' And that's a big ol' circular game of telephone where no one actually does any fact-checking. Then The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN all publish the same fake story."
Although
Pool made those big-name outlets look like irresponsible amateurs, he doesn't have a journalism degree. In fact, he didn't even finish high school. He dropped out of school and just started videotaping what interested him, funding his videos with ads and donations from viewers.
"I want to know why things are happening. Some people don't trust the media. I don't know who to believe. Why don't I just go there and see for myself?"
That's brought him more than a million internet subscribers.
It's also made him an advocate for free speech.
"When I was growing up, it was the religious conservatives that had the moral panic about music and swear words. But today the moral panic is coming from the left. Today, the left shows up with torches and burns free speech signs."
I'm glad there are young journalists like Pool, who still value open debate.
Actually, we have lots of new media options today. Joe Rogan's podcast covers viewpoints from all sides. He has won a huge audience. Dave Rubin reports on YouTube from a classical liberal perspective. Naomi Brockwell covers how tech is changing the world.
On the right, Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder and Candace Owens irreverently critique my New York City neighbors' sacred cows.
On the left, Sam Harris has attracted a big podcast following by discussing all kinds of ideas, and Jimmy Dore takes a principled left-wing stand.
I don't agree with all those new media people. I very much disagree with some of them. But I'm glad they are out there, giving us more choice.

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington: looking ahead at the Census, watching Klobuchar on Fox and watching Beto exit a minivan in the rain. So let’s get on with it.
The Census
The 2020 U.S. Census is set to decide both Minnesota’s Federal funding, and if the state will retain or lose a seat in the U.S. House. But what does adding a question about citizenship do to response rates? Read more from MinnPost.
“The main issue is that it’s not tested. They’re usually very slow to add things. They’re very deliberate,” Minnesota State Demographer Susan Brower said of the U.S. Census Department. A reasonable estimate of the impact is not there. So many things rest on the quality of this data. We don’t have good information on what the impact will be.”
Klobuchar town hall (but on Fox)
Sen. Amy Klobuchar opened up the second Fox News presidential candidate town hall, held in Milwaukee, without mincing words — she agreed that Attorney General Bill Barr should be held in contempt. “The Attorney General is the people’s lawyer. The attorney general is the attorney general of the United States of America. And he should be showing up and answering questions,” she said.
Earlier that day, the House Judiciary Committee voted on party lines to hold the Attorney General in contempt for failing to provide them with an unredacted version of the Mueller report.
The town hall as a whole allowed Klobuchar to make the case that she is a lot of things: a progressive, someone who gets things done, and someone who wants to toe the line between what people like about the Trump administration and what they don’t. The New York Times Lisa Lerer has a quick primer on her case here.
You can watch the Fox Town Hall here in three parts.
The presidential treatment
Presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke visited Minnesota on Wednesday, traveling to Lakeville and Minneapolis . “O’Rourke emerged from a minivan out front, greeted every person who stood in the rain and walked into the taproom soaking wet,” according to the Pioneer Press.
What else
* HuffPost reporter Maxwell Strachan spent time in Minnesota’s 5th District , to profile Rep. Ilhan Omar. “Let’s be clear: Were her comments harmful and hurtful? Yes. Is she getting a ridiculous amount of ink spilled and press because she is a black hijabi-wearing Muslim refugee? Yes,” said Rabbi Michael Adam Latz of Minneapolis’ Shir Tikvah synagogue.
* Rep. Betty McCollum questioned Interior Secretary David Bernhardt about climate change, quoting a U.N. report on the loss of biodiversity due to human actions, asking if he would the consider scientific evidence in how he crafted domestic energy policy. Bernhardt gave a clear answer: “Are we going to stop oil and gas development because of this report? The answer to that is no,” he said. Read more at High Country News.
* Vice President Mike Pence landed in Fargo, North Dakota this morning, before heading to Glyndon, Minnesota to promote the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Quote of the week
“In fact, year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer,” from an analysis of President Trump’s 1985-1994 tax returns in the New York Times.
What I’m reading
HuffPost: These 2020 Presidential Campaigns Plan To Pay Their Interns
At least six Presidential candidates plan to pay their interns this cycle, a striking break from past presidential election cycles in which interns were relegated to long hours of unpaid labor.
ProPublica: What Happened to All the Jobs Trump Promised?
ProPublica checked to see how many of Trump’s promised 8.9 million jobs actually came through and how many he can be credited for. The answer: 797.
That’s all for this week. Thanks for sticking around. Until next week, feel free to send tips, suggestions, and sound advice to: gschneider@minnpost.com. Follow at @gabeschneider .

Texto completo: El caso de Niels Högel, un enfermero alemán que resultó ser un asesino en serie , continúa inquietando a Alemania y a gran parte del mundo. Högel confesó haber matado a 43 pacientes pero las autoridades calculan que al menos 300 personas fueron víctimas de sus crímenes .
La pregunta que ahora se plantean los familiares de las vícitmas y la sociedad alemana en general es cómo este hombre pudo asesinar ininterrumpidamente a tantas personas en cinco años sin que nadie diera la voz de alarma . ¿No se dieron cuenta sus compañeros? ¿Y los supervisores de lo hospitales?
Niels Högel se enfrenta pronto a su tercer juicio desde 2006. En este está acusado de matar a 100 personas . 36 de ellas las mataría en la clínica principal de la pequeña ciudad de Oldenburg y otros 64 en el hospital de Delmenhorst, una zona residencial a 20 millas de Bremen.
Högel se trasladó del hospital de Oldenburg al de Delmenhorst con una carta de recomendación del primero de ellos que destacaba la capacidad del enfermero para trabajar “de manera independiente y concienzuda” y para afrontar situaciones de crisis “atenta y detenidamente” y con “habilidades técnicas correctas” .
La carta no hacía ninguna mención a las sospechas derivadas de la gran cantidad de muertes que habían ocurrido mientras Högel estaba de servicio. L a misiva de recomendación tampoco citaba que habían prohibido al enfermero estar en contacto con los pacientes .
Sin embargo, las mismas sospechas no tartaron en aparecer en el hospital de Delmenhorst, donde -según The New York Times– varios pacientes murieron bajo la supervisión de Högel en sus primeros cuatro meses como enfermero.
Högel, que ahora tiene 42 años, es considerado en Alemania uno de los asesinos en serie con más víctimas en tiempos de paz. Actualmente el hombre cumple cadena perpetua en la cárcel de Oldenburg.
Frank Lauxtermann, el primer compañero en testificar en su contra habla de la cultura alemana de hacer la vista gorda . Aunque al parecer los compañeros de Oldenburg habían hablado de él, ningunó presentó queja a los jefes. Según declaró una de las testigos, no llevaron el tema más allá por miedo o porque pensaban que no era su asunto en un país en el que mucha gente es muy celosa de su privacidad .
De hecho, Sebastian Bührmann, el juez que lleva el caso, ordenó investigar también a ocho de sus compañeros. Bührmann sospecha que los enfermeros podrían haber mentido a la corte u ocultado evidencia en el juicio actual para ocultar sus posibles negligencias . Ahora mismo dos doctores y dos jefes de enfermería del hospital Delmenhorst ya están acusados. Högel tendrá que testificar en sus juicios cuando haya un veredicto sobre su caso.
Otros antiguos compañeros del asesino en serie confeso dicen que se ganó la fama de poder manejar situaciones de vida o muerte. Por su parte, la acusación dice que esa era su estrategia ya que, en realidad, creaba situaciones en las que la vida y la muerte dependían de él.
321 de las 411 muertes que tuvieron lugar mientras Högel trabajó en el hospital de Delmenhorst ocurrieron en sus cambios de turno , según los registros. Un enfermero de este hospital sí que dio la voz de alarma pero, al parecer, los supervisores no hicieron nada al respecto.
Finalmente, en junio de 2005 una enfermera en prácticas fue más allá cuando descubrió que su compañero había desconectado la máquina que mantenía vivo a un paciente y vio en la basura los envoltorios de unos medicamentos no prescritos para él. Desde que descubrieron lo que había hecho hasta el final de su turno ese día, Högel acabó con la vida de su última víctima.
Karl-Heinz Beine, un neurólogo alemán, dijo a NYT que “Niels Högel forma parte de una minoría extrema”. El doctor, que investiga a asesinos en serie en las profesiones médicas desde 1989, dice que le sorprendió la falta de empatía de Högel incluso delante de las familias de las víctimas. Beine cree que el antiguo enfermero está motivado por el narcisismo y la falta de autoestima .

Somerville moves to ban facial recognition surveillance

Autor: Rosen, Andy. 

Información de publicación: Boston Globe (Online) ; Boston [Boston]. 10 May 2019.

Texto completo: Somerville officials have proposed a ban on the use of facial recognition in police investigations and municipal surveillance programs, part of a growing backlash against a rapidly evolving technology that critics fear may lead to false identifications and bias against minorities.
A bill to ban the technology was introduced at the Somerville City Council Thursday, and appears headed for passage later this year. Meanwhile, the state Legislature is considering bills that would enact similar prohibitions statewide. And across the country, cities such as San Francisco and Oakland are moving quickly to ban facial recognition in municipal uses.
In Somerville, the proposed ban already has the backing of nine of 11 city councilors, as well as Mayor Joseph Curtatone. The American Civil Liberties Union, which supports such crackdowns, says Somerville is the first East Coast city to push for a ban.
The lead sponsor of the Somerville measure, Councilor Ben Ewen-Campen, said he could see facial recognition being useful in serious emergencies, such as terrorism cases. But he doesn't think the technology is ready, nor has the public considered its full implications.
“I think large numbers of the public may eventually be convinced that there is a useful need for this kind of thing," he said. “But to use cases like that as the thin edge of a wedge to allow the government to just, in real time, surveil every person in every public space in our community, I think that's where the real danger is."
Ewen-Campen said he does not know of any ongoing surveillance programs in Somerville that would be banned by the measure, but said it is important to discuss the technology before it gets into widespread use.
And Curtatone, too, said he is concerned that “the ease and efficiency of tech can also be so vast and so broad that it can infringe on our right to privacy."
At the state level, similar bills have attracted a significant base of support. One measure, proposed by Senate majority leader Cynthia Stone Creem, also has the support of minority leader Bruce E. Tarr.
That bill would place a moratorium on the state government's use of face recognition and other “remote biometric surveillance systems" until the state has developed a framework for who can collect such information, how the data will be managed, how it will be audited, and what subjects' rights will be.
“I don't think we're arguing that this is something that would never work," Creem said. “I just would argue that at this point . . . it's pretty clear that it's not developed."
Just as facial recognition technology can help social networking services such as Facebook to identify friends in your uploaded pictures, it can also help police and other government agencies look for possible suspects and potential threats in images collected by investigators or taken by the thousands of public cameras in use.
But civil rights advocates say that there are not nearly enough safeguards in place to make sure that the technology is being used ethically, or even whether it works correctly.
For instance, research published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University last year found that commercial facial recognition programs misidentified the gender of dark-skinned women as much as one-third of the time, while they made similar errors on light-skinned men in fewer than 1 percent of cases.
Moreover, alarm over potential misuses of the technology by governments has grown with the disclosures that the Chinese government had used facial recognition as part of its crackdown on the Uighur ethnic minority. The New York Times reported in April that law enforcement in one Chinese city ran 500,000 scans in a single month over surveillance cameras to identify Uighurs.
Kade Crockford, who runs the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said facial recognition should not be used by law enforcement because it is unreliable and the public has not had enough time to consider the implications of its use.
Facial recognition systems are used by some US police departments; Amazon, for example, has been pressured by people in the artificial intelligence field to stop selling its facial recognition system to law enforcement agencies.
Plymouth's Police Department was recently pitched on a facial recognition technology by a Cambridge startup that sells surveillance tools to law enforcement. Suspect Technologies cofounder Jacob Sniff had proposed that Plymouth police install cameras with facial recognition capabilities in public buildings around town, and suggested the department could tap into a statewide database of driver's license photos, according to e-mails the ACLU obtained through public records requests.
However, the company was told the state had denied previous requests to access the photo database. And Plymouth police Chief Michael E. Botieri told the Globe in a phone interview in April the town won't use the Suspect Technologies program as proposed. Instead, Plymouth will test out the company's software — on a free-trial basis — in criminal investigations to compare faces in video evidence against those in the department's booking photos.
The software, Botieri said, is simply “an investigative tool," and even if it registers a match, “you wouldn't just arrest someone based on what the computer says. It just points you in a direction to investigate."
“I totally get the privacy issue," Botieri added. “It's something people feel is intrusive."
In a statement to the Globe Friday, Sniff said his company “strives to provide video analytical solutions that enable public safety authorities to solve crime, improve the quality of life for their local communities, and provide technology that is designed to respect privacy and protect the innocent."
Facial recognition is but one of several new technologies that have extended the surveillance reach of law enforcement, and have raised a host of new privacy questions that governments around the United States are racing to resolve. In Massachusetts, the State Police ran a program for more than three years collecting license plate data of every vehicle that crossed the two Cape Cod bridges — more than 100 million trips — without disclosing its use to drivers.
Ewen-Campen, the Somerville councilor, is pushing another measure that would increase public oversight of surveillance technology in Somerville. But facial recognition, he added, is in a class of its own, “and that's why until we have that conversation about what the regulations are, what the guardrails are, a ban is really the only way that we can go."

Texto completo: Trevor Noah is returning to Orlando.
Last time, in January 2018, the "Daily Show" host played the Bob Carr Theater.
When he returns, at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 28, Noah will perform at the Amway Center - a sign of his growing popularity.
Tickets go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. today. Tickets start at $36.50 and may be purchased by calling 800-745-3000 or at Ticketmaster.com.
Noah has won a wide following since he succeeded Jon Stewart on "The Daily Show" in 2015. His first book, "Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood," became a New York Times bestseller in 2016. He just launched a new podcast series, "On Second Thought: The Trevor Noah Podcast," on Luminary.
"The Daily Show" airs at 11 p.m. Monday-Thursday on Comedy Central.
In an interview last year, he talked about President Donald Trump, a frequent subject of late-night comedy. "I don't think Donald Trump is going to destroy America," Noah told me. "I think America is stronger than him. He can do some damage. But I don't think he'll be the end of the place as a whole."

Texto completo: CAMBRIDGE — Before Daniel and Patrick Lazour were out of their teens, they'd already authored three full-fledged musicals that were staged at a community theater in their hometown of Boylston. If the shows demonstrated the Lazours' promise as composers and writers, to them it felt like child's play. Was this really something they could do as a profession?
“We started this journey with none of the pressures of an 'industry' or 'making a career,' and that probably instilled the love of the [musical] form in us," says Patrick Lazour, 28, the older of the two brothers.
Now the Lazours are poised for their first big professional breakthrough, in a city just 40 miles from their hometown but, theatrically speaking, a world away. After six years of development, the American Repertory Theater is presenting the world premiere of their musical “We Live in Cairo," inspired by the events of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, at the Loeb Drama Center, from May 14 to June 23.
The show earned them a 2016 Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theater, which helps promising composers and playwrights get their work produced in New York. Previous recipients have included 2019 Tony nominee Anaïs Mitchell (for “Hadestown") and the Tony-, Grammy-, and Oscar-winning team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (for “Dogfight").
The spark for the show started with a photo Patrick saw while a student at Boston College. The indelible image, shot by photojournalist Ed Ou and appearing on the front page of The New York Times, shows young people gathered around a table scattered with coffee cups and cameras in a flat near Tahrir Square in Cairo. The glow of MacBooks illuminates their faces, and cigarettes hang from their mouths as they post updates and upload videos from the massive demonstrations. It captured the hopeful energy, uncompromising determination, and sense of possibility that reverberated across the Arab world in early 2011 during the 18 days of the Egyptian Revolution.
Patrick says he was immediately captivated by the “dynamism" and “communion of youth" depicted in the image. “It's like we knew these kids," says Patrick, seated alongside Daniel while on a rehearsal break at Oberon. “There were these similarities to our lives, but there were also small things that signaled to us that there was a lot more going on."
“One kid's head was bandaged" Daniel, 25, continues. “In a video [that accompanied the story], it says that if these activists don't succeed, they'll be tortured or killed. So they're taking great risks with their protests, and that was inspiring."
When Patrick is “hopped up" about an idea or piece of art or music, Daniel says, “it's infectious." The story they created follows six burgeoning activists brandishing their tools of revolution — cameras, laptops, guitars, and spray-paint cans — as they take to the streets to protest police violence and the brutal regime of President Hosni Mubarak, and to advocate for new social and economic freedoms. The action moves from the heady early days of the uprising and the ouster of Mubarak, to the country's first free and fair presidential elections in its citizens' lifetimes, to the dashed dreams of a population facing a military crackdown, widespread censorship and repression, and a new iron-fisted ruler.
The Lazours and their director, Taibi Magar, want to explore what unfolded in the eight years since the events of the revolution and ask hard questions. “What is the nature of activism? Is activism personal? Is it political?" Patrick says. “When is it time to act? When is it time to step aside? Is it ever time to step aside? And how far does one go, how much does one sacrifice, for the love of one's country?"
As they worked on the show, Magar, whose father immigrated from Egypt as a young man, says she and the Lazours felt a “deep apprehension" about being seen as interlopers from the West co-opting a story that's not theirs to tell. But during a trip to Egypt in late 2017, they received feedback that suggested they were on the right track. After a reading of the show at the American University in Cairo, they went for coffee with a student who had told them how moved he was by the story.
“He said, 'It brings me solace in my heart to know that you'll be over there in America telling our story — because we can't,' " Magar recalls. “It felt like the permission we wanted and needed, and I hold onto what he said almost every day."
In penning the score, the Lazours drew upon their mother's Lebanese heritage. Daniel, a pianist who majored in music composition at Columbia University, says they didn't want the music to simply reflect their own American sensibilities. So he went back and listened to the Arabic songs his grandfather used to play when they were kids. That grew into what he calls “a love affair" for divas like Umm Kulthum and Fairuz; Sayed Darwish, the so-called father of Egyptian popular music; and Sheikh Imam, a celebrated '60s and '70s performer who wrote political songs for the poor and working class.
Ramy Essam — who wrote anthems that became the virtual soundtrack of the revolution — was also a key influence. “There was such an amazing, rich blend of music playing in the Square during the revolution, from traditional Arabic music to Western rock music, from old to new, and we wanted [our score] to reflect that," says Daniel, who taught himself how to play guitar in order to write “the earthy protest-music sound" they wanted.
When the Lazours were growing up, music and show tunes were frequently heard around the house, and the brothers recall their parents, Paul and Nel, taking them to see shows in Boston. In high school, they wrote a short election-themed musical, “That Tuesday in November," with friends for a play competition. Patrick, who was on the crew team at St. John's High School in Shrewsbury, says with a laugh, “I pretended I was the jock of the family." But when a college recruiter inquired about his other interests, he talked enthusiastically about writing musicals with his brother. “The guy was like, 'I can tell in your voice that's what brings you real joy.' "
Indeed, it was the three musicals they created for Calliope Productions in Boylston every summer from 2009 to 2011 that set the Lazours on their current path. “Tribulations of the Millionaire" explored the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash. “Robynn McCree" centered on a female Irish ward boss in turn-of-the-century South Boston. And “Affairs of a French Afternoon" was a musical-comedy they describe as a “sex-farce soufflé" set in the time of Louis XVI. People around town were hugely encouraging, and it gave the Lazours a big boost of confidence. “I feel like those three summers launched us and gave us some momentum to continue for a long time with this," says Daniel.
With “We Live in Cairo" poised to open at the ART, the Lazours are thrilled to share the fruits of their labors with friends and family who live nearby. It also has them looking back on their formative experiences. “As kids, we were always collaborating with each other, creating stories and making music," Patrick says. “We pursued it as a profession as the result of the strength of our relationship, and from there it's blossomed into a real passion."

Texto completo: BOSTON — Harvard University has barred prominent former professor Jorge Dominguez from its campus and stripped him of his emeritus status after an investigation found repeated "unwelcome sexual conduct" targeting multiple students and faculty over four decades.
The school Thursday announced the completion of a yearlong Title IX investigation into Dominguez, a government professor who was accused last year amid the #MeToo movement of a pattern of groping and other sexual harassment by at least 18 students and junior faculty members.
Harvard also said it now plans to conduct an external review of the school's response to the complaints against Dominguez, a onetime vice provost. Many on the Ivy League campus have criticized how he was retained and even promoted at Harvard despite repeated complaints over the years.
Dominguez, an expert in Latin American studies and Cuba in particular, resigned last year after the new allegations, ending a run at Harvard that began in 1972. He had been disciplined by Harvard in 1983 for alleged sexual harassment but was allowed to continue teaching at the university anyway.
#METOO: Professors face their own reckoning
Claudine Gay, Harvard's dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in an email to the community Thursday said the investigation, conducted internally by the school, found "a longstanding pattern of behavior that, at several points, violated policies designed to ensure a safe and non-discriminatory educational and work environment. "
"I am appalled by the report’s findings and heartbroken for those who had to endure the behaviors described," Gay said. "Subjecting anyone in our community to unwanted conduct of a sexual nature is unacceptable. "
She said sanctions include revoking Dominguez's emeritus status, typically reserved for retired faculty, which comes with several privileges including the ability to teach courses on campus.
Dominguez has also been disinvited to all Faculty of Arts and Sciences campus and each of its activities held off campus, Gay said, and at her request, Harvard has disinvited him from Harvard’s campus and from off-campus Harvard-sponsored events.
Harvard did not make the specifics of the report available, including the conduct of Dominguez or the possible failure of Harvard staff to follow up on allegations.
Gay cited "tension" in all Title IX cases between the privacy of parties and the broader needs of the community, but said she decided to share the findings and sanctions of this investigation after deciding it is "vital for the safety" of the Harvard community.
"Following our policies and procedures has resulted in a set of sanctions that, in effect, removes Jorge Dominguez from our community," Gay said. "This has, in turn, created an obligation for our community to be informed of the removal. "
Dominguez could not be reached for comment.
Harvard's commitment to conduct an external review follows the release of a 52-page report last week from a committee of students that, according to the New York Times, called for the outside investigation and other changes such as the hiring of more female professors and creating an anonymous reporting system for harassment.
The Boston Globe reported that the committee's report, which looked at the government department where Dominguez worked, called Dominguez's continued employment a “deplorable situation” and a “prolonged institutional failure. ”
Government students warned other students to avoid late-afternoon meetings with Dominguez and to wear baggy clothing, the study found, according to the Globe, and that his behavior was "an open secret. "
Many of the women shared their stories with the Chronicle of Higher Education last year – how he would try to kiss them, touched the inside of their thigh, pressed his crotch into them during hugs and slid his hand down their back to touch their behinds.
Harvard President Lawrence Bacow, in an email Thursday addressed to the committee, agreed to bringing in outside experts for the external review to look at whether the school's "procedures, practices, and norms" have hurt its ability to ensure a safe work environment for all.
Bacow pointed to three areas of focus with the Dominguez situation as a guide: What characteristics of Harvard or its culture "might have inhibited" those who have experienced misconduct from reporting it? Are there "impediments to an effective response" when misconduct is reported? How can Harvard ensure promotional decisions are made with a proper understanding of reports or allegations of misconduct?
He said he will share further updates on the external review, including who will lead the effort, in the coming weeks.
But some at Harvard want more action from the school. The Harvard graduate students union has been pushing for a "third-party, neutral grievance process" for the reporting of sexual harassment in the future.
"Harvard failed to manage this growing crisis on its campus for 42 years," Rachel Sandalow-Ash, a second-year student at Harvard Law School, research assistant and union member said in a statement Thursday. "The system is broken.
"After countless cases of harassment and zero solutions, it’s time for Harvard to face facts: the University has failed survivors, and is incapable of fixing this problem internally. Harvard can't be allowed to police itself. We need strong protections against discrimination and harassment in our union contract, including a neutral third-party grievance procedure. "

Journalist or criminal: Julian Assange, notorious for leaks of US secrets, faces computer hack charge

Resumen: The federal case against Julian Assange separates journalism from criminality

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As purveyor of secret U. S. government information, Julian Assange has few rivals.
The release of a stunning trove of sensitive diplomatic cables and entire Pentagon databases nearly a decade ago made Assange and his anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks a household names and an enemy of the American government.
Six years later, WikiLeaks published thousands of private emails involving members of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that investigators said were stolen and passed to Assange's organization working for the Russian government. That episode and others so infuriated U. S. authorities that then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo called Assange's organization a "hostile intelligence service. "
But none of those things prompted the government to call Assange a criminal.
When the U. S. government revealed its long-rumored criminal case against the WikiLeaks founder on Thursday, the leaks that made him either famous or infamous merited only scant mention.
Instead, federal prosecutors unveiled a single count outlining a simple criminal conspiracy alleging that Assange joined with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 to crack a password on a secret computer network within the Defense Department. It wasn't clear from the charges that they succeeded.
That case appeared to be the result of a yearslong struggle within the Justice Department over what to do about WikiLeaks and its famous founder, whose activities the government has said repeatedly jeopardized U. S. security but also were difficult to distinguish from those of journalists who frequently print information the government would rather keep secret. The question that vexed prosecutors was where to draw the line between journalism and crime.
Wherever that line is, prosecutors say Assange crossed it on March 8, 2010, when they allege that he agreed to help Manning crack a password on the Pentagon's computer network. In framing the case that way, the Justice Department cast its focus on conduct that separates Assange from journalists who receive and publish classified secrets.
“I think the top line takeaway form this: journalism is not a crime, but hacking is,” said April Doss, a former National Security Agency associate general counsel. "What we see in the indictment is the Department of Justice being very careful to draw that distinction and make clear that the indictment is not for anything that he published. The indictment really centers around the allegation that he was conspiring to hack into Department of Defense computers. ”
Doss said the nature of the government's charge is so limited in scope that it should provide "comfort" to journalists who report on national security.
"This indictment does not cause any risk to journalists who are encountering that information," Doss said. "What it does is reinforce the longstanding rule that nobody can commit crimes in order to get that kind of information. ”
Ryan Fayhee, a former federal prosecutor in the Justice Department's National Security Division that is overseeing the Assange case, said that while it is possible the government could file additional charges, the concise seven-page document unsealed Thursday appears to reflect a purposeful strategy by prosecutors.
The single hacking charge, Fayhee said, could ease the otherwise tricky process of extraditing Assange to the United States, in part because the British government also recognizes computer intrusions as crimes. And by narrowly focusing on Assange's alleged code-breaking scheme, any effort to assert a First Amendment defense will likely be more difficult to argue.
Arrested: Julian Assange, WikiLeaks founder, faces US hacking conspiracy charge
Indictment: Julian Assange indictment: Read the grand jury indictment against the WikiLeaks founder
Leaks: Six big leaks from Julian Assange's WikiLeaks over the years
"It's one thing for a journalist to publish information from a source who has access to it and is willing to risk the consequences," Fayhee said. "It is quite different, though, for a journalist and a source to be willing to work together to take information from a protected computer. "
Yet within hours after Assange's London arrest, the anti-secrecy activist's lawyers and free-press advocates warned that his prosecution represented a serious threat to journalists and news organizations in the United States, suggesting that the case essentially criminalized publication.
Prosecutors said Assange, too, had solicited secrets. When Manning told him he had passed along the last batch of records he had gathered from Army computers, prosecutors said Assange replied "curious eyes never run dry. "
What is WikiLeaks
Almost from the moment Assange and WikiLeaks burst onto the public stage in 2006, a debate has ensued over whether the boyish Australian should be defined as journalist or activist.
In 2009, Assange and WikiLeaks were among those honored with Amnesty International Media Awards, along with such mainstream news organizations as CNN, the BBC and Newsweek. The lone recipient in a category reserved for "New Media," Assange was recognized for his work on a project implicating Kenyan police in mass killings.
Assange's notoriety, however, exploded in 2010 and 2011 with the mass release of classified U. S. government records, ranging from secret assessments of U. S. prisoners held at the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay to thousands of sensitive cables issued by State Department diplomats.
And in 2016, Assange drew the attention of federal investigators and the repeated praise of then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for disclosing thousands of damaging email communications from Democratic political organizations stolen from the Democratic National Committee by an arm of Russia's intelligence service.
"I love WikiLeaks," Trump declared at a 2016 rally.
Wikileaks' involvement in the dissemination of the communications became a focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign had coordinated with the Russian government to win the White House.
While Mueller ultimately found insufficient evidence of such a conspiracy, according to a summary of the special counsel's authored last month by Attorney General William Barr, suspicion surrounding Assange and his intervention in the 2016 campaign has not abated.
Mueller has closed his 22-month investigation and a final report of his findings are being readied for public release, but Doss, the former NSA associate counsel, said that Assange could hold information that may be valuable to federal investigators – another potential reason for the government to seek his extradition to the U. S.
"It is certainly possible that he has information that would be of interest to federal prosecutors either in the indictments that have already been filed or in potential new proceedings," Doss said. "Over time, he might be interested in pursuing a plea agreement if it looks like he’s facing a real prospect of jail time. "
Targeting leakers
Federal authorities have declined to comment on whether Assange could face additional charges. But the prospect of such an action by the Trump administration, which has repeatedly castigated the press, could mean trouble not only for Assange but for working journalists, said Mark Feldstein, a University of Maryland journalism professor.
In past leak cases, the government has largely targeted the leakers or whistle-blowers, including celebrated former military analyst Daniel Ellsberg for his role in disclosing the Pentagon Papers, rather than targeting The New York Times or The Washington Post for publishing the documents.
“The danger, if they start charging the press for publishing, is that would create an unprecedented expansion of the government’s powers,” Feldstein said. “With Trump and this administration, it wouldn’t surprise me if he would seek to widen the conflict with the news media in a way that other administrations have mostly sought to avoid confrontation with the news media. ”

Texto completo: He was the "goodest boy" of them all. As one of the first U.S. Army service dogs, bull terrier mix Sgt. Stubby endured mustard gas and shrapnel from grenades during his time in World War I France.
The long-treasured mascot's bravery and service will be honored with an unveiling of a bronze statue in his likeness at the AKC Museum of the Dog in Manhattan on May 23, where it will be housed permanently.
Stubby was on the front lines of 17 battles over the course of 18 months, warning his unit of chemical attacks - he had a specialty gas mask to fit over his little muzzle - and incoming artillery shells. He also helped find wounded soldiers and offered them comfort, and even captured a German spy by the seat of his pants in the Argonne - not letting go for anything. It was his role in nabbing the spy that earned him the rank of sergeant.
When Sgt. Stubby returned back from war, Gen. John J. Pershing awarded the four-legged fighter a medal for his bravery. The pooch even met three presidents, Wilson, Coolidge and Harding.
Stubby joined the Army somewhat by accident. In 1917, he wandered onto the camp of the 102nd Infantry Regiment of the 26th Yankee Division at Yale. A young soldier named Robert Conroy took a liking to him, named him "Stubby," and smuggled the dog onto his vessel in an overcoat when it was time to ship out.
Stubby essentially became the official mascot of the 102nd Infantry Regiment, with fans back in the States.
After "retirement," he was so famous that the Grand Hotel Majestic in midtown Manhattan lifted its ban on dogs so he could stay there while on his way to Washington, D.C., according to the Connecticut Military Department's website.
Eventually, he became the Georgetown Hoyas' team mascot, where he would push the football around at halftime to amuse fans. He was also made a lifetime member of the YMCA - it offered him three bones a day - the Red Cross and the American Legion, marching in every Legion parade until his death in 1926.
His body was preserved and presented to the Smithsonian in 1956. The New York Times wrote a lengthy obituary for the pup, "Stubby of A.E.F. Enters Valhalla."
Also in remembrance of the canine's accomplishments, a "Sgt. Stub

Texto completo: President Donald Trump on Wednesday acknowledged taking massive tax write-offs for real estate losses topping $1 billion from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s, calling it "sport" among developers like himself during that period.
Trump was reacting to a New York Times report Tuesday that his businesses lost more than $1 billion from 1985 to 1994. The newspaper said its reporting was based on printouts it acquired of Trump's official IRS tax transcripts, including figures from his federal tax form.
Trump reported business losses of $46.1 million in 1985, and a total of $1.17 billion in losses for the 10-year period.
The president appeared to defend his actions in a pair of tweets early Wednesday.
"Real estate developers in the 1980's & 1990's, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases," Trump tweeted. He contended the reported losses were "non monetary."
"Sometimes considered 'tax shelter,' you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes.almost all real estate developers did -- and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport," Trump said.
He claimed the Times report was a "highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!" based on old information.
After comparing Trump's information with that of other "high-income earners," the Times concluded that Trump "appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer." Because of his business losses, the newspaper reported, Trump did not pay income taxes for eight of the 10 years.
The House Ways and Means Committee has asked the IRS to provide Trump's personal and business returns for 2013 through 2018. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday refused to do so, saying the panel's request "lacks a legitimate legislative purpose." Mnuchin oversees the IRS.
Trump is the first president since Watergate to decline to make his tax returns public.
Meanwhile, New York's Senate easily approved a bill Wednesday that would allow three congressional committees to get access to President Donald Trump's state tax returns, giving Democrats a potential end-run around the administration's refusal to disclose the president's federal returns.
The bill, which now goes to the state Assembly, doesn't target Trump by name but would authorize state tax officials to release returns filed by several state and federal officeholders if requested by the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation. Both chambers of the state Legislature are controlled by Democrats.
The law would apply to returns filed by the U.S. president and vice president, U.S. senators, the state's governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general or comptroller.
It would include filings related to personal income taxes, real estate taxes and corporate income taxes and cover up to five years of returns before the person took office.
Trump's home state is New York, where many of his business enterprises are based. Financial information in state returns is likely to mirror much of what is in his federal returns.
Republicans said Democrats should be focused on lowering the state's high taxes and improving the lives of New Yorkers, not going after the president's tax returns, a move GOP senators deemed intrusive and a violation of privacy rights.
The vote fell along party lines, with 39 Democrats in the 63-seat Senate voting for the measure.
White House officials didn't respond to a request for comment.

Texto completo: When Brett Beldock, a Manhattan-based furniture designer, was growing up in the city in the early '70s, she would buy "the grooviest jeans in the world" at the Different Drummer, a boutique whose advertising poster was designed by Peter Max, the psychedelic artist. Ms. Beldock's new capsule collection of marijuana-themed wallpaper, titled Dispensary, recently put her in mind of that old store, but its look was certainly not modeled on the hippie emporiums of yore.
Instead, inspired by the comfortable Victorian parlor of a medical marijuana dispensary she visited in San Francisco, Ms. Beldock created designs based on antique botanical drawings -- but the plant is pot. Two of the patterns, Botanical Weed and Botanical Ganja, use the sedate shades typical of Farrow & Ball paint colors; a third, Mary Jane, references the ornate foliage in the artist Kehinde Wiley's portrait of President Obama.
"These dispensaries are popping up all over the country," Ms. Beldock said. "Why wouldn't I do wallpaper for these spaces that look like living rooms?"
With dozens of states having legalized marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, or both, in recent years, designers like Ms. Beldock are seizing the opportunity to define the look of a growing industry and lifestyle. And as the drug loses its outlaw, déclassé status, going from "weed" to a "flower," the design around marijuana is similarly shedding its head shop past and becoming more elevated.
Some nouveau marijuana designs make winking reference to old-school pot imagery, like the ashtrays and vessels printed with red lips and leaves that Jonathan Adler created last year for the Manhattan flagship of Higher Standards, a retail shop. Sometimes it's about treating pot in an unexpected way, as with Ms. Beldock's old English specimen drawings. Often, it means creating an altogether fresh design vocabulary.
Whatever the case, being a pot smoker is not a requisite. As Mr. Adler told The New York Times last year, "I don't smoke or do any drugs, but you can get a decorative dirty frisson."
Megan Stone, the founder and principal of High Road Design Studio, who does consume cannabis, is a leading practitioner of a field she helped invent: dispensary design. In 2011, Ms. Stone was a college design student and a part-time "bud-tender" at a dispensary in Santa Ana, Calif., when her boss gave her a modest budget of $ 5,000 to improve the space.
She installed nice display cases, painted the walls and made other simple fixes. There was so much room for improvement that customers began telling her "they felt like they were shopping at the Tiffany's of dispensaries," Ms. Stone said.
She added: "This was still the era of bulletproof glass and bars on the windows. There are a ton of professional people that use cannabis every day, and we're in this place where we're a little embarrassed because we're not hippies and stoners."
Back then, the only thing Ms. Stone could find online pertaining to marijuana and design was an article about Sparc, a Bay Area dispensary designed by Larissa Sand that won an architecture award. "Dispensaries were a space that had never been touched by design," Ms. Stone said.
Her firm has designed about 50 dispensaries in 16 states. Every space is different, owing to the noncorporate, patchwork nature of the industry, but in all of Ms. Stone's projects, she aims for a polished, handcrafted look. She brings in a millworker for custom cabinetry and is big on contrasting colors and textures.
While she avoids stoner clichés, Ms. Stone does try to "blow minds," usually with an eye-popping design feature. For Maitri Medicinals, in Uniontown, Pa., she created a 14-foot-high lobby wall covered in historical documents like the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 that she reprinted on hand-pressed paper. To dress up the ubiquitous A.T.M., Ms. Stone hung more than 1,400 colored ribbons from a wire-mesh frame to create a tunnel that customers walk through.
"It's functional and provides privacy," she said, "but it's memorable and provides a living art piece in their showroom."
Bruce E. Teitelbaum, the chief executive and founder of RPG, a design/build firm for brands and retailers, said he adhered to the same design principles for the medical marijuana provider Columbia Care, for which RPG created a dispensary in Manhattan in 2016, as he did for clients like Barnes & Noble College, which runs campus bookstores: "We followed the philosophy of good taste, good design, good customer navigation."
Like Ms. Stone, Mr. Teitelbaum avoided showing up-close photos of gnarly buds, à la High Times, and instead kept any references to the product for sale artistic, and subtle. He installed terrariums with succulents and other potted plants.
"That was a touch to the natural quality, the growing quality," Mr. Teitelbaum said. "It's like going into a great bakery and understanding they must have a beautiful kitchen and beautiful process of baking bread when you just see the front end."
The activity of marijuana smoking has always had its gear, and this too has gotten a design upgrade in recent years. Higher Standard sells pipe-cleaning products like finely milled rock salt and "ISO Pure" solvent in packaging that looks as if it came off-the-shelf at Sephora.
The company Apothecarry Brands specializes in "high quality organizational systems," like a $ 300 airtight, odor-resistant, lockable home storage case.
"I kept my wine in a wine fridge and my high-end cannabis in a shoe box under the bed. It didn't make sense," said Whitney Beatty, the company's chief executive.
Ms. Beatty said she designed the attractive wood case because she couldn't find any on the market -- at least none that spoke to her self-image as a successful businesswoman and mother. "I love tie-dye as much as the next person. But I'm living a Pottery Barn lifestyle. I do not need a stereotypical cannabis store item."
Products like the Apothecarry Case point the way to the home as the next frontier of marijuana design. One can imagine herb humidors instead of wine cellars, dedicated smoking rooms instead of basement hide-outs for getting high. The walls of these spaces could be covered in Mary Jane, Ms. Beldock's wallpaper. "Unfortunately, it's not scratch and sniff," she joked. "Then it would be a real success."
But perhaps the true vanguard of marijuana design -- and a sign of how subtly it will be incorporated into our everyday lives -- can be found at the Desert Hot Springs Inn, in California's Coachella Valley. The boutique hotel has become popular for its welcoming attitude toward cannabis.
John Thatcher, the manager, is "pushing 60" and of the generation that remembers lava lamps, beaded curtains, black light posters and all the hoary design once associated with smoking pot. At the hotel, he said, there is none of that stuff, because "the guests are not looking for that."
Despite the smell of pot wafting through the inn's six rooms, there isn't a dedicated smoking lounge, either. Nor are there plans to create one. The Desert Hot Springs Inn looks like any other boutique hotel, the only difference being the guests can freely light up.
"We do have a big backyard area. A lot of people go out there," Mr. Thatcher said, adding, "It's a very mellow situation. My general philosophy with the hotel is I just let things flow."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Resumen: Bush will return tp TV this fall as host of the syndicated entertainment-news show "Extra Extra." It's his first hosting gig since being fired by "Today" in 2016 following the 2016 Trump tape scandal.

Texto completo: Billy Bush turned from a household-recognized TV host to a pariah in 2016, when he disappeared from the air after tapes emerged of a graphic conversation he had with Donald Trump.
Bush will return with his first show since going off-air following the scandal, hosting the new syndicated entertainment-news show "Extra Extra" when it debuts in the fall. It promises a more modern edition of the entertainment show currently hosted by Mario Lopez.
“We all have to be able to evolve as we grow,” Bush said in a People story announcing his new gig. “The guy that left the scene in 2016 was already a changed person (since 2005), but I had the opportunity to grow up a little bit. Facing adversity in some way is good. And I feel I’ll be better at my job than I ever was. This is my next step. ”
In October 2016, NBC News suspended and later fired Bush, then a host on the third hour of "Today after footage emerged from a 2005 "Access Hollywood" interview with Donald Trump, in which they can be heard having a lewd conversation about sexually assaulting women.
Since then, Bush has occasionally surfaced to apologize and correct the record, like on December 2017, when Trump denied it was him on the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape.
In a New York Times op-ed titled, "Yes, Donald Trump, You Said That," Bush wrote that Trump's "revisionist history" had "hit a raw nerve in me. I can only imagine how it has reopened the wounds of the women who came forward with their stories about him, and did not receive enough attention. "
To them, he said, "I will never know the fear you felt or the frustration of being summarily dismissed and called a liar, but I do know a lot about the anguish of being inexorably linked to Donald Trump. You have my respect and admiration. "
Earlier that year, During a May visit to CBS' "Late Show," Bush told Stephen Colbert that the number of women accusing Trump and their stories had made a strong impression on him.
"As I read (their accounts), I said (16) women don't get together and say, 'Hey, you know what would be really fun? Let's take down a powerful guy, ha ha. ' No, they don't," he told Colbert. "And I said, 'OK, you're reopening wounds on them, too. Enough's enough. Stop playing around with people's lives. ' That upset me. "

Texto completo: Esca, the theater district restaurant that was the celebrity chef Mario Batali's first and most elegant seafood-focused venture, has been sold to Dave Pasternack, its longtime executive chef.
Mr. Pasternack and his new partners acquired the restaurant from the entity formerly known as Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group on Tuesday, said Joe Bastianich, who had been Mr. Batali's primary partner. Esca closed for renovations after service on Saturday night, and will reopen in June.
The restaurant group has been working to regain its footing since revelations of Mr. Batali's history of sexual aggression and assault came to light in 2017. In March, Mr. Batali's partners in the group -- the chef Lidia Bastianich; her children, Mr. Bastianich and Tanya Bastianich Manuali; and the California chef Nancy Silverton -- closed a deal to buy all of his shares in Batali & Bastianich for an undisclosed sum. At the time, Mrs. Bastianich Manuali promised that Mr. Batali "will no longer profit from the restaurants in any way, shape or form."
With the sale of Esca, the group has more than a dozen remaining businesses, including Del Posto, Babbo and the Lidia's and Mozza restaurants, all in the United States. At its peak, Batali & Bastianich ran more than two dozen places, some through lucrative international hotel and casino contracts. The six restaurants the group operated with the Sands corporation, in Las Vegas and in East Asia, were the first to close after the Batali scandal hit.
In a statement about Tuesday's sale, Mr. Bastianich said, "After an incredible 20 years of collaboration, Dave Pasternack and his new team will be taking full control and ownership of Esca restaurant." A representative for Mr. Batali said he had no comment.
Mr. Pasternack and his new partner, the restaurateur Victor Rallo, already run two restaurants together on Staten Island, Surf and Barca. They are now majority partners in Esca.
In an interview, Mr. Pasternack, who opened Esca with Mr. Batali and Mr. Bastianich in 2000, expressed both gratitude and relief at acquiring the restaurant. "I was never able to get the restaurant back to where it was before it all came out," he said, referring to the revelations about Mr. Batali.
Revenue has been down by at least 30 percent, he said, since December 2017, when investigations by The New York Times and Eater uncovered Mr. Batali's longtime pattern of sexual harassment and substance abuse. The New York Police Department subsequently started three investigations into complaints of sexual assault against Mr. Batali; in January, the cases were closed for lack of evidence.
Mr. Pasternack said the corporate regulars and theatergoers who were Esca's most loyal customers told him that they could not patronize the restaurant as long as Mr. Batali was a partner.
With that shadow lifted, and no more oversight by a larger restaurant group, Mr. Rallo said he and Mr. Pasternack would be able to redecorate the room, change the menu and restock the wine cellar according to their own tastes.
"I'll still be out there fishing," said Mr. Pasternack, who, famously, has always been the main seafood forager for Esca's kitchen. (Esca means "bait" in Italian.)
But the new restaurant will serve more cured meats and more modern, vegetable-focused dishes, he said, while retaining classics like his corn salad with walnuts, and hand-cut pasta with sea urchin.

Texto completo: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal said Tuesday that the committee will weigh its options regarding its demand to review President Trump’s tax returns, hinting it could soon take the administration to court to force the release of the documents.
“There does not have to be an intermediary step,” Neal said.
Regarding the status of the tax returns investigation, the Massachusetts Democrat said that he would be consulting with lawyers for the committee and for the House Thursday, and that “I’ll have an answer for you by the end of the week."
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin denied Neal's request for Trump's tax returns on Monday, saying that there wasn't a legitimate purpose for the demand, setting up the possibility of a court battle.
Neal downplayed the possibility of issuing a subpoena, noting that other committees have not been successful in obtaining information from the administration that way.
And he all but ruled out a motion to hold Mnuchin in contempt of Congress, telling reporters the committee is not currently considering that.
“We’re going to talk on Thursday, but that’s not a point of conversation at the moment,” Neal said.
Citing advice from the House’s legal counsel not to comment on the ongoing investigation into Trump’s taxes, Neal declined to comment on a New York Times report Tuesday that Trump did not pay taxes in eight of the years 1985 through 1994 due to business losses, which totaled approximately $1.2 billion.

FACEBOOK'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IT'S RUN BY PEOPLE WHO LACK THE WISDOM AND HUMILITY TO USE THEIR POWER RESPONSIBLY

Texto completo: Over the past several years we've learned a lot about the unintended consequences of social media. Platforms intended to bring us closer together make us angrier and more isolated. Platforms aimed at democratizing speech empower demagogues. Platforms celebrating community violate our privacy in ways we scarcely realize and serve as conduits for deceptions hiding in plain sight. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="68">
Now Facebook has announced that it has permanently banned Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos and a few other despicable people from its social platforms. What could possibly go wrong?
The issue isn't whether the people in question deserve censure. They do. Or that the forms of speech in which they traffic have redeeming qualities. They don't.
Nor is the issue that Facebook has a moral duty to protect the free-speech rights of Messrs. Farrakhan, Jones and their cohorts. It doesn't. With respect to freedom of speech, the First Amendment says nothing more than that Congress shall make no law abridging it. A public company such as Facebook - like a private university or a family-owned newspaper - has broad latitude to feature or censor, platform or de-platform, whatever and whoever it wants. Facebook's house, Facebook's rules.
The issue is much simpler: Do you trust Mark Zuckerberg and the other young lords of Silicon Valley to be good stewards of the world's digital speech?
I don't, but not because conservatives believe (sometimes with good reason) that the Valley is culturally, politically and possibly algorithmically biased against them. As with liberalism in academia, the left-wing tilt in tech may be smug and self-serving, but it doesn't stop conservatives from getting their messages across. It certainly doesn't keep Republicans from winning elections.
The deeper problem is the overwhelming concentration of technical, financial and moral power in the hands of people who lack the training, experience, wisdom, trustworthiness, humility and incentives to exercise that power responsibly.
That much should have been clear by the way in which Facebook's leaders attempted to handle their serial scandals over the past two years. Ordering opposition research on their more prominent critics. Consistently downplaying the extent of Russian meddling on their platform. Berating company employees who tried to do something about that meddling. Selling the personal information of millions of its users to an unscrupulous broker so that the data could be used for political purposes.
Now Facebook wants to refurbish its damaged reputation by promising its users much more privacy via encrypted services as well as more aggressively policing hate speech on the site. Come again? This is what Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer, called "the judo move: In a world where everything is encrypted and doesn't last long, entire classes of scandal are invisible to the media."
In other words, it's a cynical exercise in abdication dressed as an act of responsibility. Knock a few high-profile bigots down. Throw a thick carpet over much of the rest. Then figure out how to extract a profit from your new model.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="78">
Assuming that's Facebook's deeper calculation - it's hard to think of another - then it may wind up solving the company's short-term problems. But it might also produce two equally dismal results.
On the one hand, Facebook will be hosting the worst kinds of online behavior. In a public note in March, Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that encryption will help facilitate "truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism and extortion." (For that, he promised to "work with law enforcement." Great.)
On the other hand, Facebook is completing its transition from being a simple platform, broadly indifferent to the content it hosts, to being a publisher that curates and is responsible for content. Getting rid of Mr. Farrakhan, Mr. Jones and the others are the easy calls for now, because they are such manifestly odious figures and they have no real political power.
But what happens with the harder calls, the ones who want to be seen publicly and can't be swept under: alleged Islamophobes, militant anti-immigration types, the people who call for the elimination of Israel? Facebook has training documents governing hate speech and is now set to deploy the latest generation of artificial intelligence to detect it.
But the decision to absolutely ban certain individuals will always be a human one. It will inevitably be subjective. And as these things generally go, it will wind up leading to bans on people whose views are hateful mainly in the eyes of those doing the banning. Recall how the Southern Poverty Law Center, until recently an arbiter of moral hygiene in matters of hate speech, wound up smearing Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Maajid Nawaz, both champions of political moderation, as "anti-Muslim extremists."
Facebook probably can't imagine that its elaborate systems and processes would lead to perverse results. And not everything needs to be a slippery slope.
Then again, a company that once wanted to make the world more open and connected now wants to make it more private. In time it might also become a place where only nice thoughts are allowed. The laws of unintended consequence can't rule it out.

6 things to understand about bonds

Texto completo: Conventional wisdom says bonds zig when stocks zag, smoothing out volatile periods for investors with blended stock-and-bond portfolios.
Yet, last year that didn't happen. Corporate and government bond indexes dipped with stocks, raising the question: "What good are they, really?"
To answer that, let's explore some basics – what bonds actually do in portfolios and what makes them tick.
First: Bonds are simply loans. Buying a bond from a government or company means they borrow your money for a fixed period, promising to pay regular interest, and repay your principle at the end. In between, the bond's value will fluctuate.
Second: Interest rates underpin those fluctuations. Bond prices and interest rates sit on opposite ends of a seesaw. When rates rise, bond prices fall – and vice versa. Pretend you own a Treasury bond paying 2% and maturing in 2029. If 10-year Treasury rates subsequently rise to 3%, your bond's price will decline. Fewer people want to buy it when they can get a 3% interest rate. But, if 10-year Treasury rates instead fall to 1%, your higher-yielding bond becomes more attractive – its price will rise.
Third: For long-term government bonds, the main interest rate driver is future changes in inflation expectations. When everyone expects faster inflation, they'll demand higher interest rates to offset it.
Corporate bonds have more variables, including the company's changing creditworthiness and growth prospects. These will influence its ability to repay you later on. In this way, corporate bonds' and stocks share some similarities – your first clue they don't always move oppositely. More mathematically, consider correlations: They measure how closely related two assets' movements are. Identical movement score is 1.00; exact opposite is -1.00. What's the correlation between stocks and seven- to 10-year corporate bonds? It's -0.01. That's almost exactly midway. In other words, corporate bonds zig with stocks almost exactly as often as they zag against them.
Even Treasurys move with stocks more often than commonly thought. Why? Because a "Goldilocks" economy with moderate growth and low inflation, like now, keeps a lid on interest rates. Their correlation with stocks: -0.28.
Fourth: While the zig-zag effect of bonds helps sometimes, it isn't what makes them helpful for blended portfolios. What is? Said simply, their wiggles, both up and down, are smaller. If you're taking big cash flow from your retirement investments, this can be a big deal.
Fifth: The sharp ups and downs stocks bring can make cash flow-planning difficult. A slug of bonds dampen the swings somewhat. The relatively smoother ride means modestly lower long-term returns than 100% stocks. But that trade-off may be worth it for those relying on their investments for living expenses.
Regardless, growth remains important to offset inflation and generate enough future wealth to prevent you from running out of money. So owning too much in bonds becomes hugely risky for those with long future needs. But dampening volatility really does benefit those with shorter time horizons.
From this standpoint, bonds "worked" last year. They fell, but markedly less than stocks. That cushioned the blow somewhat for investors who owned both, while interest payments helped fund folks' cash flow needs. The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 4.4% last year, but a broad gauge combining U.S. corporate and government bonds fell just 0.8%.
Finally: Bonds can rise in basic value. Like stocks, bonds have enjoyed a V-shaped recovery so far this year, thanks to falling long-term interest rates and easing recession worries. Corporate bonds have done particularly well, and their bounce likely slows now. But benign long-term interest rates and strong overall corporate fundamentals point to a fine year for the category overall.
Next week: a closer look at bonds' risks. Yes, they have them.

Texto completo: The Broadneck High School Chick-Fil-A Leader Academy will host "Touching Base with First Responders," a benefit softball game and silent auction, on May 28.
It will raise money for the 100 Club of Anne Arundel County, an organization that supports families of fallen firefighters and police officers. The game, which begins at 4 p.m., will feature community first responders taking the softball field against Broadneck students.
Admission to the game will be free, however, donations are accepted and concessions will be sold. The students will also hold a silent auction to raise money.
The Chick-Fil-A Leader Academy (CFA), is an organization that promotes leadership through service projects within the community and is led at BHS by teachers Diane Casey and Christina (Nina) Yeatman. Students participate in the program for a year, and during that time carry out service projects, and learn important leadership and communication skills. The school year kicked off with the students collecting donations and assembling care packs for military troops.
During the month of "Do Good" December, the group held a book drive where it collected, packed and donated more than 1,000 books for the Rotary International Book Drive. The softball game is the "culminating impact project," according to CFA member Anna Scofield, a 10th grader. The scope of the project was decided by the group as a whole and the 22 members are organized into teams. Each team has specific responsibilities, such as recruiting the first responders to participate, reaching out to media for promotion, obtaining donations, etc. The students are part of the program for one year of high school. Student members such as Makena Smith said participation in the program has "helped with leadership skills."
For more information on participating in the event, or cash or in-kind donations for the silent auction, email student officers Bryant (Bubba) Bowen (bryantbubbabowen@gmail.com) or Kayla Bladziski (kbladzinski2003@hotmail.com)

Texto completo: The New York Times is rightly regarded as a newspaper with a liberal political bias, which is just fine provided it restricts that liberal bias to its editorial pages (the same applies to newspapers with conservative political biases).
Today, however, at least in the view of this writer, the Times and many other newspapers with a liberal bias have increasingly blurred the distinction between straight reporting and editorial opinionating. Much of this can be attributed to the Trump presidency, which has outraged liberal newspapers. But to be fair, this blurring also has creeped into conservative media outlets as a way, in their opinion, to justifiably counterbalance this liberal line-crossing between reporting and opinion.
Ironically, one of the most dedicated practitioners of separating factual reporting from editorializing - of ensuring the stories reporters wrote contained only the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth - was the former executive editor of The New York Times, Abe Rosenthal.
Rosenthal joined the paper in 1943 as a reporter - in 1960 he won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of Eastern Europe under the Soviet Iron Curtain - and spent the next half century rising through the ranks to executive editor and regular columnist.
As managing editor in 1969, he oversaw the paper's coverage of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War. He successfully fought for publication of the Pentagon Papers, which exposed the government's clandestine and illegal conduct of the war despite those papers being classified, and despite the Times facing multiple lawsuits and threats of treason.
As executive editor, Rosenthal had "zero tolerance" for reporters who included their opinions in their stories, once saying he knew most reporters leaned left, so his editorial stance was to lean slightly right "so the paper ended up in the middle."
Also, any reporter with a potential conflict of interest regarding an assigned story was immediately taken off that story.
At one point a young female reporter joined the paper after working for The Philadelphia Inquirer, after which it was revealed she had been romantically involved with a politician she had covered in Philadelphia and had accepted gifts from him. When she admitted to Rosenthal that the story was true, he fired her immediately, prompting protests by several newsroom staffers who thought he had been too harsh.
Rosenthal replied, "I don't care if you (fornicate with) an elephant on your own time, but if you do, you can't cover the circus for this paper." It became known as the Rosenthal Rule.
Rosenthal died this week (May 10) in 2006 and is buried in Westchester Hills Cemetery in Westchester County, N.Y. At his insistence the epitaph on his tombstone reads, "He kept the paper straight."

Fareed Zakaria: The Trump whisperer and his dark worldview

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Understanding Donald Trump’s foreign policy is a challenge, since the president has written and spoken little on the subject for most of his life. So how to make sense of his worldview? Is there a Trump Doctrine?
Michael Anton, a former Trump national security official, believes there is, and he explains it in a new essay in Foreign Policy. The Trump Doctrine, Anton argues, is simple: “Let’s all put our own countries first, and be candid about it, and recognize that it’s nothing to be ashamed of.” But, as Daniel Larison responds in the American Conservative, “That isn’t a doctrine. It is a banality.” What country has not put its own interests first? What president has argued to give preference to “global interests” over American ones?
Anton outlines a certain kind of nationalist conservatism that does seem to be at the heart of Donald Trump’s worldview. More important — since Trump is rarely consistent and could change his mind tomorrow — it reflects the views of the man closest to him on foreign policy, national security adviser John Bolton.
Bolton has been variously described as a neoconservative, a paleoconservative and a conservative hawk. In fact, he is simply a conservative, in the oldest, most classical sense, someone who has a dark view of humankind. As a former U.S. official told the New Yorker, Bolton believes that Thomas Hobbes’ famous description of life without order applies precisely to international life — “nasty, brutish and short.”
Bolton believes that to protect itself and project its power, the United States must be aggressive, unilateral and militant. Bolton seems to share the worldview that animated Dick Cheney, who after 9/11 spoke openly about the need to “work … the dark side” and to “use any means at our disposal basically to achieve our objectives.”
There are some in the foreign policy establishment who believe that a revanchist Russia poses a grave threat to America. Others worry about a rising China or an ideological Iran. For Bolton, it’s all of the above and more. He has at various points warned darkly about the mortal threat posed to the United States by Cuba, Libya, Syria and of course, Iraq. A longtime fan of regime change, he recently labeled Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua a “triangle of terror” and said the U.S. “looks forward to watching each corner of the triangle fall.” It seems he wants them to fall not to usher in an era of democracy, but because they resist American power and influence. “The Monroe Doctrine is alive and well,” Bolton told the New Yorker’s Dexter Filkins. “It’s our hemisphere.”
This kind of conservatism believes that national interests are worth pursuing not because they are virtuous — about democracy and freedom — but because they are ours. This view originates in a cultural chauvinism and can easily morph into racism.
And sure enough, a senior State Department official, Kiron Skinner, recently explained that the challenge with confronting China is that it is “a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.” She noted: “The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family.”
Where to begin? The Cold War was an existential struggle because the Soviet Union believed it had a superior ideology of economics, politics and society that it would impose on the rest of the world. That is why it was called “totalitarian.” China’s rise to power is the standard process by which a new powerhouse economy tries to find a space on the international stage. China’s system, incidentally, is largely a mixture of two Western ideas, capitalism and communism — Adam Smith and Marx — which is why The New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof has aptly described it as “Market-Leninism.”
By Skinner’s logic we had more in common with Hitler’s ideology than with the Chinese because the Nazis were Caucasian, which is both historically uninformed and morally grotesque.
The more practical problem with the Cheney-Bolton worldview is that it is profoundly inaccurate. The world is not nasty, brutish and short. Life has improved immeasurably during the past 100 years. Political violence — deaths from wars, civil wars and terrorism — has plummeted. And this has happened in large part because human beings also have the genes to cooperate, to compete peacefully and to weigh the costs of war against their benefits.
Bolton says that he might well invoke the “Roosevelt Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine — which asserts that the U.S. can use force unilaterally anywhere in the Western hemisphere. If he does, what is the argument against Russia doing the same in Ukraine, China in the South China Sea, and Iran in Yemen? Without rules and norms, the U.S. would have to militarily thwart every such effort or else accept a world of war and anarchy. You see, nationalist assertiveness works as long as only you get to practice it.

Road to recovery saved Ehlo's life Confronting addiction led to family stability

Texto completo: Fourteen years in professional basketball taught Craig Ehlo all about any day-to-day public humiliations that are the inevitable flip side of athletic glory.
It's the lessons from life's private humiliations that remain ongoing.
And he keeps count.
"This is my sixth year away from addiction," Ehlo said. "Six years in August."
That private torment came to public light on the night of Aug. 1, 2013, when Ehlo was arrested by Spokane sheriff's deputies after firefighters responding to a call at his home found family members holding him down outside near a pile of burning clothes.
His family had confronted him over his continued use of hydrocodone that had escalated after a third back surgery in 2010 stemming from injuries accumulated over his NBA career. On the eve of a family trip, they confiscated pills he'd stockpiled.
"I was loopy and they were taking my stuff and I just said, 'Screw y'all,' and started burning my clothes," he said.
His arrest and the court order to have no in-person contact with his wife, Jani, and his three children or return home was, he acknowledged, "embarrassing." But his single night in jail was also transforming.
"It made me confront my addiction and start on repairing my life and relationships with my family," Ehlo said.
He spent a month at Gosnold, a treatment center in Massachusetts. When he returned home, the court order remained in effect for two more weeks, so he lived with his mother-in-law.
"The support from my wife, my kids - all my family - was incredible," he said. "They made what could have been hard easier."
Still, it took time to build trust.
"When I couldn't get pills from doctors, there was this girl I'd met who could get prescriptions and I'd take off," Ehlo said. "So when I came back, I'd get in my truck to go someplace and they'd ask, 'Where are you going? I'll go with you.' That was probably the first two years. They wanted to know where I was going and what I was doing, which is natural."
He continues with Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and attends a regular Bible study. And in time, he accepted that he had a platform to talk to people dealing with the same issues "and maybe get an open door that might be closed to somebody else." He did an interview for a New York Times story in 2015, and for a long profile in The Inlander the next year.
"My wife's thinking at first was, 'Can't we just get rid of this and put it away?' " he said. "But she actually got three or four calls from some women she's interacted with that had addiction problems and they told her, 'What your husband said really helped.' And that kind of changes your thinking."

Texto completo: Ask any jazz aficionado about the most challenging jazz standard ever written, and you'll likely get a knowing smile followed by two simple words: "Giant Steps." The tune, composed and performed by legendary saxophone genius John Coltrane, has sent chills down the spines of would-be performers since its release nearly 60 years ago.
Performed at a blistering speed, the structure is a 180-degree departure from the unwritten rules of jazz. From a technical standpoint, it is as far from the norm as is musically possible, making it extremely difficult for even the most talented and experienced musicians to navigate. Despite the song's demanding nature, it has become a history-making classic that is both feared and revered.
As a jazz musician myself (for over 40 years), I've often reflected on this treacherous tune. Full of irony, its complexity created its beauty. Its difficulty demands respect. Its unorthodoxy made it unforgettable. I began to wonder ... are there lessons from this masterful work that could apply to us mere mortals?
Here are three that struck me:
1. Chase the hard stuff. While cutting corners and seeking simplicity is easy, that is not the stuff of legends. Coltrane sought to tackle the most difficult structure he could imagine and, in turn, made history. Just because something is hard, it doesn't mean it should be shuttered. In fact, greatness is often achieved in the face of adversity and complexity.
2. Break the rules. Despite the free-flowing nature of jazz, there are some inherent rules that were not to be broken. That is until Coltrane rewrote those guardrails while creating something fresh, compelling, and magical. Too often, the constraints we believe are unbreakable reveal beauty and success when violated. "Giant Steps" is a legendary song because the rules were broken. Think what you can create by shattering — not complying — with the traditional rules of engagement.
3. Show up fully prepared. The one unfortunate part of the 1960 "Giant Steps" recording is the solo by Detroiter Tommy Flanagan, one of the best pianists in history. Flanagan, a consummate pro, had been to dozens of recording sessions in the past and cranked out masterful work. Thinking he didn't need to prepare, he was caught off guard with the complexity and boldness of "Giant Steps." As a result, he stumbled through the solo with obvious difficulty, producing an uninspired improvisation. The embarrassment — one of very few in his 61-year career — haunted him until his passing in 2001. The lesson here: Never underestimate an upcoming battle. It is a truism that applies to music, business, and life.
Fifty years after Flanagan's death, the breathtaking work of John Coltrane still inspires musicians today. Coltrane made history by applying these three principles to his most famous composition. Think what you can do when applying the same approaches to your career, company and community.
Music to my ears.

Texto completo: It's a rare individual who doesn't sometimes imagine herself or himself doing another job — and doing it well.
When our favorite softball or baseball player strikes out, it's easy to think we would have hit the ball.
When an NCAA women's or men's basketball player misses a buzzer-beater in the March Madness tournaments, we might tell ourselves we would have sunk the shot.
And when a political candidate we might favor stumbles to answer a question, our minds are racing to spit out what would have been a better answer.
Having been a newspaper editor for some time now, I'm well aware many a reader pictures himself or herself in my shoes. Some common refrains:
"Don't you have any proofreaders down there?"
"I know you'll never cover (reader's preferred topic) because you're always covering (not reader's preferred topic)."
"Your paper would be better if it weren't so (liberal/conservative)."
Truly effective criticism, however, comes from thoughtful readers enmeshed in their community who clearly are rooting for their local newspaper to succeed as they lay out coverage approaches and angles they'd like to see. Those are the emails I appreciate most, even as I often concede the reader is right.
Conceding this is not as difficult as it sounds. I'm humble enough to know every news organization has its great days, its good days and its not-so-good days. And even in the era of major metropolitan print newspapers 25-50 years ago, there were plenty of local stories that went uncovered, particularly in communities of color.
Even today, when newsrooms are less than half the size they were at the turn of this century, great work has and can be done in communities large and small. A commonality of such groundbreaking work by local news organizations (as opposed to national sites like The New York Times that have far more resources) is a deep commitment to community on the part of the journalists in the newsroom.
Higher-level reporting, writing and videography are time-consuming and taxing; you're either all-in or you'll never succeed at it. Having gotten to know the D&C's tremendous team of journalists in my first few months here, I am gratified at how "all-in" these reporters and photographers and editors are.
As a result, a number of plans are in the works, for later in 2019 and eventually into 2020, to raise the bar on the impact of our work. The efforts you'll see in coming months are aimed at holding local and state leaders accountable, at assisting the most vulnerable among us and at helping local readers understand better the forces that have shaped western New York, for good and sometimes for ill.
These efforts build on a proud history of award-level work at the D&C, most recently under Karen Magnuson's leadership, and at the old Times-Union, which earned the Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the 1971 Attica prison riots.
I've been blessed over the years to guide or support journalists in four different states through intense stretches of vital coverage including recovery from storms; the response to police shootings of unarmed persons; and the community grieving that accompanies the deaths of public-safety personnel in the line of duty.
In more hands-on roles previously, I've edited stories that placed a harsh spotlight on government's failure to address local needs including environmental protection and children's health.
I've seen work that's changed the course of history in a local community because of the coverage's depth and impact. And I've helped reporters and videographers develop wrenching narrative stories that caused action by leaders and citizens alike to address an ongoing community need.
That's the type of work I've come back to Monroe County to foster. It requires planning, organization and a certain amount of time. And it takes a news team willing to dig deeper and reach higher for our readers. You'll see.
Having said that, I'd like your ideas, as a D&C regular or occasional reader, about community needs you'd like to see us deliver coverage about in coming months and years.
Please refrain from purely political coverage ideas and instead focus on the needs and aspirations of every-day people in the city of Rochester, in our towns and in the rural areas of our region.
What questions do you have about how life locally could be at least a bit — and sometimes a lot — better? If you were editor, what would you insist be covered more thoroughly?
Please email me. I look forward to your ideas.
I pledge to you this: The D&C team will do its best to serve greater Rochester and each of our readers every single day.
Thanks for reading.

Texto completo: It's not surprising that Woody Allen would want to tell the world his life's story, how he grew up a lower-class Jewish boy in Brooklyn to become a comedian, writer, actor and one of the most acclaimed American directors of the second half of the 20th century.
Presumably, the 83-year-old would spin humorous anecdotes about working as a comedy writer in 1950s TV, and then about how he broke into stand-up, Broadway and films, eventually directing such classics as "Annie Hall," "Manhattan" and "Crimes and Misdemeanors." Maybe Allen would discuss being influenced by Charlie Chaplin and Ingmar Bergman and share memories of working with such A-list stars as Diane Keaton, Kate Winslet, Scarlett Johansson and Penélope Cruz.
Allen's memoir would cover key moments of culture in the past seven decades, so it could be a useful historical document.
But no major publisher wants to touch it, reports The New York Times. Executives at four major publishing houses told the Times that the director has a finished manuscript that he has been shopping around in the last year, but he has not received any offers to publish it.
Some executives used the word "toxic" when describing the challenges of working with Allen in a post-#MeToo era, the Times reported.
Over the past two years, Allen's reputation has taken a major hit over resurfaced allegations that he molested his daughter Dylan Farrow when she was 7 years old. Allen has denied the allegations, which were first promoted by his ex-girlfriend Mia Farrow after their nasty breakup in 1992. The allegations never led to criminal charges or conviction.
But #MeToo supporters have taken up the cause of believing Dylan Farrow, as Hollywood and other industries have faced a reckoning over widespread sexual harassment and assault. Allen's fiercest critics include his son Ronan Farrow, the New Yorker writer who won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on sexual misconduct allegations against other powerful men in Hollywood, particularly Harvey Weinstein and Leslie Moonves.

Doggone discourse would be better focused on real problems

Texto completo: Boy, is our political discourse going to the dogs.
The Washington Post reports Donald Trump is the first U.S. president in 100-plus years not to have a dog — though others, including Ronald Reagan, didn't have dogs until their second terms. During a February rally, reports The Post, Trump said "he doesn't have a dog because the idea of getting one seems 'phony' to him." Using presidential pets to score political points is not without precedent. The Hill says "avid dog lover" Herbert Hoover was among the first to do so while running for the nation's highest office.
"Following campaign advice, with hopes of shaping his image into something warmer and more charismatic, he released a photograph of himself with his German Shepherd, King Tut," says The Hill.
King Tut helped Hoover win the White House, but after he presided over the 1929 stock-market crash, Hoover was routed by FDR in the 1932 presidential election. According to The Hill, some suggested Bill Clinton got Buddy, his beloved chocolate Labrador, to help his image at the peak of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Maybe so, but photos clearly show Clinton enjoyed Buddy's company. George H.W. and Barbara Bush had Millie, an English springer spaniel who famously birthed six White House puppies. Millie's book was a huge seller. Their presidential son had a dog, too. "President George W. Bush's Scottish terrier, Barney, became a celebrity in his own right, appearing in more than 10 films while he was at the White House," says The Hill. The Obama family chose Portuguese water dogs Bo and Sunny, in part because Malia Obama required a hypoallergenic breed. The canines brought joy to the Obama family and were a delight at various White House events. But no dog for the Trumps? "Ever since President William McKinley's administration — which began in 1897 — every single occupant of the White House, save for Trump, has had a dog at some point," reports The Post.
Trump said he'd feel odd walking a dog on the White House lawn and just doesn't have the time to do so. And that resulted in a loud negative response, in these over-charged times, that the current occupant of the White House loathes all things canine.
"WHY DOES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HATE DOGS?" asks Newsweek.
"Instead of having dogs, which tend to crave attention and often are scene stealers where photography is involved," Newsday columnist Anne McFeatters tells us, "Trump frequently calls women he disdains 'a dog.'" In a New York Times column, Timothy Egan writes: "We know that Donald Trump, the first president without a pet since James K. Polk, appears to hate dogs." The "Trump hates dogs" narrative got to a point in which it prompted fact-checking website Snopes to investigate whether Trump's critics are barking up the wrong tree. Snopes' conclusion?
"The claim that he 'hates dogs' appears to be based on shaky logic ... and relatively scant evidence ... . It is also contradicted by photographic evidence and first-hand accounts of Trump's cheerful demeanor around dogs."
Like or dislike Trump — goodness knows he evokes powerful passions among supporters and opponents alike — it's troubling to me that so much ink and bandwidth would be spent on so trivial a subject, when so many matters of larger importance are begging for our attention. Just another sign that our political discourse is really going to the dogs.

Texto completo: POWAY, Calif. – Congregants at the Chabad of Poway heeded a call to "fill the synagogue" on Friday night, nearly one week after a deadly synagogue shooting at the Southern California house of worship.
As some congregants walked to a unity service and dinner, they passed community members holding signs of support. Drivers honked horns in agreement.
"It's a community that comes together, and this type of hatred can't take over who we are. It's not welcome here," said Leslie Talansky, who was holding a sign that said "Poway Strong. "
Law enforcement officers were clearly visible in the area surrounding the synagogue. Multiple street corners were lined with flowers; signs were left with messages such as "Share love and kindness. "
Last Saturday – the last day of Passover – a gunman entered Chabad of Poway and opened fire, killing one person and inuring three others. Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein was among those injured.
April 30: Hundreds gather in Poway to celebrate the life of Lori Kaye
April 29: Family of girl injured in Poway synagogue shooting: We fled violence in Israel. We thought it was safe here
Goldstein has publicly urged Jews to respond to the tragedy by becoming more devoted to their faith.
"From here on in I am going to be more brazen," he wrote in a New York Times opinion piece on Monday. "And I’m going to use my voice until I am hoarse to urge my fellow Jews to do Jewish. To light candles before Shabbat. To put up mezuzas on their doorposts. To do acts of kindness. And to show up in synagogue – especially this coming Shabbat. "
A standing-room-only crowd of about 700 gathered at the synagogue earlier in the week to honor Lori Gilbert Kaye, 60, who died in the attack.
The Chabad-Lubavitch organization said earlier this week that the Poway congregation was launching a "fill the synagogue" campaign, asking Jews to show solidarity with the congregation in light of the tragedy.
Shabbat is a term for the Jewish sabbath, a time between sundown Friday night and sundown Saturday night when observant Jews refrain from many daily tasks such as driving and cooking.

ICE DOCUMENT INDICATES PALANTIR SOFTWARE AIDED DEPORTATIONS

Texto completo: A newly released document appears to show that the United States used software made by Palantir in an operation in which immigrants crossing the border were arrested for deportation, contradicting the Silicon Valley data company's previous denials about being involved in deportation operations.
The ICE document, titled "Unaccompanied Alien Children Human Smuggling Disruption Initiative," was among those made public this week after Freedom of Information Act requests by immigration groups. It specifically mentioned that Palantir software was used to place information about the arrival of unaccompanied minors at the border into an Investigative Case Management (ICM) system.
The Intercept reported in 2017 that Palantir developed ICM at the request of ICE.
Mijente, an immigration advocacy group that was not among those that requested the documents but which connected the dots based on its knowledge of Palantir's technology, on Thursday urged the company to cancel its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement something it also did last year during a protest at the company's headquarters.
"Mijente is also calling on investors not to invest in a company that played a key role in family separation," the group said in a blog post, referring to Palantir's expected upcoming initial public offering.
A Palantir spokeswoman said Thursday that the company would have no comment. Miijente said it had not tried to contact the company.
"Palantir has been unwilling to have conversations with us," said Mijente spokeswoman Jacinta Gonzales Thursday.
Last fall, Mijente released a report titled "Who's behind ICE? The tech and data companies fueling deportations." In the report, the group expressed concern about "unprecedented levels of surveillance, detention and deportation" under the Trump administration. Mijente identified Palantir co-founded by Peter Thiel, the most high-profile tech figure to support Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign as one of the key companies at the "forefront" of those efforts.
Alex Karp, chief executive of Palantir, said in an interview with the New York Times last year that he and Thiel "did not vote for the same people." The company, which was also backed by the CIA's venture capital arm, has acknowledged contracts with the federal government. But a company statement to the New York Times in December took pains to point out that its ICE contract was with the division responsible for cross-border criminal investigations, not the division for enforcement and removals.
However, the 2017 document made public this week shows that the arrest and deportation operation, which yielded more than 400 arrests, was a joint operation between those two divisions.
"Palantir's software was used throughout helping agents build profiles of immigrant children and their family members for the prosecution and arrest of any undocumented person they encountered in their investigation," Mijente says in its blog post.
In addition, a 2016 privacy impact assessment by the Department of Homeland Security specifically states that ICM is used by the enforcement and removal division.

What makes popular video app TikTok tick?

Texto completo: Open up TikTok — the wildly popular short-video app your kids spend most of their day on — and there's no telling what you'll see. 
My first tap offered up a clip of construction workers using a forklift to hoist a portajohn containing an indisposed friend. (Ha. Swipe.) Then teen TikTok star Madison Schooley (154,000 followers) practicing dance moves with two of her friends in a carpeted room. (Swipe.) Then I see a girl dancing in the street within a human-size Slinky. (Wow. Swipe.) Then a woman falling on her face after trying to push a glass door that wasn't there. (Ow. Swipe.) Then a kid creating spectral spirals by pouring paint on a spinning circular canvas. (Ooooh. Replay.) 
This is the “getting to know you" stage of my relationship with TikTok. And in the increasingly human-ish relationship we have with our apps, it's also the most important. 
Originally launched in China as Douyin, TikTok was revamped and relaunched globally in its current form by parent company ByteDance in 2016. The following year, ByteDance acquired the enormously popular lip-syncing video app Musical.ly, and one year after that, Musical.ly was absorbed into TikTok. That lip-sync legacy has stubbornly stuck around as one of the defining social milieu of TikTok — which traffics exclusively in 15-second videos.
But apart from its endless interpretations of Taylor Swift songs, a major reason TikTok has accumulated more than half a billion users worldwide since launching in 2016 is that it operates in a fundamentally different way than most of its social media competitors.
Like Facebook (at first) and Snapchat, it's a network built on a mix of content from inside and outside of one's social circles. But while what we might now call “traditional" social media centered your social life and treated the world outside of it as something to be invited in, TikTok — from the moment you tap the app — pushes you out into the world and attempts to guess where you'd want to go. 
Those first five videos I watched (or skipped) were just the starting point for a long, AI-assisted learning process whereby TikTok gradually assembles and caters to an idea of who and what I like to watch. And my next 100 swipes bore this out: When I lingered on a video I saw more like it. When I replayed a video for whatever song it contained, that song reappeared later in the queue. It's likely that TikTok's machine learning tracks every aspect of videos you watch — from the filters they're run through to the stickers and songs that festoon them. 
While it's easy enough to create videos on TikTok, it's this mutual exchange of consumption and refining of preference that feels like its raison d'etre. (Though documenting poorly executed choreography seems to run a close second.)
Of course, you barely notice this push-and-pull after 10 or so videos. Or 100. Or 1,000. Once it “gets" you, the TikTok experience becomes a friction-free glide into the curated unknown. 
And TikTok seems aware of the bottomless hole of content it has coaxed millions of users into, even offering a screen time management setting in its “Digital Wellbeing" menu to nudge you off the app. If keeping up with friends on Facebook ever felt like a mild addiction, TikTok is hoping you'll be even more interested in strangers. 
“Imagine a version of Facebook that was able to fill your feed before you'd friended a single person," wrote John Hermann in his primer for The New York Times, “That's TikTok."
All of which adds up to a promising solution to the gripes of many disaffected Facebook users, who loathe the daily slog through its endless stream of ads, articles, arguments, and aggrandizement. It also means a major problem for parents already wary of letting their kids onto digital playgrounds. 
In India, the app is just coming off a weeklong ban imposed by the government on grounds that the app was "encouraging pornography," spreading sexual predation, and generally endangering children. (It was also having to actively combat the spread of fake news across the platform in advance of India's elections.)
And here in the US TikTok agreed back in February to pay $5.7 million in fines to the FTC to settle allegations that it illegally collected information from users under 13 by failing to require parental consent and not complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  
Since then, there's been a far more visible push on TikTok to empower users to control content and boost safety.
Shortly after the FTC settlement, it introduced “a limited, separate app experience" for children “that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for this audience," “does not permit the sharing of personal information," and “puts extensive limitations on content and user interaction." Two months later it forged a public partnership with Internet Matters, a “not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to empower parents and carers to keep young people safe in the digital world"
These are important measures, but even as TikTok learns how best to police a userbase that signed up for a free-for-all, it's important to recognize it as part of a larger turn in social media.
With Facebook launching its own TikTok clone (Lasso), and erstwhile Vine founder Dom Hoffman actively teasing his forthcoming short-video app Byte, we'll be seeing a lot more of these high-exposure platforms; and by necessity, they'll be seeing a lot more of us.

Texto completo: Rep. Mark Meadows says it is "no coincidence" the New York Times reported on Thursday the FBI sent an undercover investigator to meet with a Trump campaign adviser during the 2016 election.
These "leaks" show the FBI feels threatened by an investigation by Attorney General William Barr into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, the North Carolina Republican said in a tweet.
"Incredible. Now confirmed: 'FBI Sent Investigator Posing as Assistant to Meet With Trump Aide in 2016,'" Meadows said, quoting the headline of the Times report.
"It’s absolutely not a coincidence that these leaks are coming out now. The FBI knows Bill Barr is investigating. The IG report is coming. They’re worried. We’re getting closer," he added.
Tweet
Meadows, a member of the House Oversight Committee, has been a leading GOP investigator examining alleged bias within the upper levels of the Justice Department and FBI. Last month he predicted a wave of criminal referrals to be sent to the Justice Department based on Inspector General Michael Horowitz's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation, which is expected to wrap up in the coming weeks.
The Times report revealed that a woman who said her name was Azra Turk posed as an assistant to Stefan Halper, an American professor at Cambridge University and informant for the FBI looking into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Turk asked Papadopoulos point blank if Trump's campaign was working with the Russians at a bar in London in September 2016.
In reaction to the article by the Times, Papadopoulos insisted that Turk was not working for the FBI. "I agree with everything in this superb article except 'Azra Turk' clearly was not FBI. She was CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel. She could hardly speak English and was tasked to meet me about my work in the energy sector offshore Israel/Cyprus which Turkey was competing with," he wrote in a tweet.
Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year. He agreed to cooperate with the Russia investigation conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller, who recently wrapped up and found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians.
Barr says he is "reviewing the conduct" of the FBI's initial investigation into the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016. He sparked an uproar among Democrats last month when he said "spying did occur" on the Trump team. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who insists there is "evidence in plain sight" of collusion, called Barr's spy remark "another destructive blow to our democratic institutions."
Responding to Meadows' tweet on Thursday another Republican, Rep. Jody Hice, chastised the Democrats for their efforts to impugn Barr.
"And the Left thought Bill Barr was crazy for using the word 'spying.' Looks like he hit the nail right on the head," the Georgia congressman said. "Can’t wait to hear Adam Schiff & his circus try to explain this. Or the IG report. Or what Barr’s investigation exposes. The truth is finally coming out."

A journalism advocacy group is trying to blacklist news websites, mostly those with a conservative editorial lean

Texto completo: The Poynter Institute, a nonprofit journalism advocacy group, this week published an “index of unreliable news websites.”
It names several newsrooms that feature right-leaning commentary, including the Washington Free Beacon, the Daily Caller, and, for a while it included the Washington Examiner.
The really curious thing here is not that a pro-journalism group's blacklist would include right-leaning newsrooms, but that such an organization would produce a blacklist at all. There is something discordant about a group whose mission is to champion “freedom of expression, civil dialogue and compelling journalism” simultaneously being in the business of blacklisting real (albeit opinionated) news organizations as “unreliable.”
"Fake news is a business. Much of that business is ad-supported,” researcher Barrett Golding explains in the report published this week by Poynter. “Aside from journalists, researchers and news consumers, we hope that the index will be useful for advertisers that want to stop funding misinformation.”
He adds, "Better data means better results for researchers, reporters and readers. So the International Fact-Checking Network built a more complete dataset: UnNews, an index of unreliable news sites.”
The index was created by curating “fake news” databases maintained by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, data designer Chris Herbert, Merrimack University, PolitiFact, and Snopes, Golding explains, adding that he was also careful to discard inactive sites named by these groups.
However, as with most attempts to compile “fake news” websites, the index relies on unreliable criteria. This has led to all sorts of absurd results, such as the lumping in of political commentary and parody websites and responsible (if politically influenced) newsrooms with actual click-farms that fabricate honest-to-goodness “fake news.”
The UnNews index includes, for example, ClickHole, Reductress, the Drudge Report, and Daily Kos. None of these entries make sense in terms of rooting out “fake news.”
Reductress and ClickHole are satirical websites – the latter being an offshoot of the Onion. The index even labels them as “satire,” which raises the questions: Why include them at all? The Drudge Report, meanwhile, merely aggregates headlines from other newsrooms. If Drudge, which the index labels as “bias,” links the New York Times, is the Times now biased? Lastly, Daily Kos, which is rated “clickbait,” is not even a news site. It is a site where progressives write commentary diaries and sometimes share news links.
Golding explains that Daily Kos was included as "fake news" because it was among several “sites we reviewed [that] had mostly false verdicts from fact-checking sites.” ClickHole and Reductress are on the list because they have been flagged by fact-checkers who worry readers won’t get the joke.
Meanwhile, certain “highly politicized” sites, including AlterNet and National Review, were spared inclusion on the “fake news” index because they were “mostly not fake.” I guess that is why the Huffington Post is also not on the list. But that does not explain how CNS News ended up on the list but NowThis News did not.
Also, as mentioned earlier, the Washington Examiner was initially included in the index. It has since been removed. Poynter added an editor’s note to its article, which reads, “After reviewing our methodology, we found that neither [the Washington Examiner nor FirstPost] met the criteria for inclusion, so both were removed.” Good on them for removing it. But the fact that these were included in the first place suggests extreme incompetence, malleable or inconsistent standards, or both. What, exactly, prompted the Washington Examiner’s inclusion on the list, and did it suddenly vanish when somebody called to complain?
The underlying problem is that “fake news” databases more often than not ensnare sites that do not deserve the tag. And on top of that, Poynter is misguided in getting into the business of blacklisting in the first place. Rather than tell readers what not to read, a pro-journalism and free speech group should focus instead on advising readers on what to read. Give readers the tools to learn and decide for themselves. Do more than just disparage satire websites and newspapers whose editorial lean is different from your own.

Q&amp;A: Aubrey Marcus on being a little bit better today than you were yesterday

Texto completo: Onnit CEO Aubrey Marcus has dedicated his company to helping people become the best versions of themselves. The Westlake High School graduate and former star basketball player started his quest toward self-improvement as a teenager and later founded his company on the mission of total human optimization.
The Austin-based company has grown over the past eight years from a supplement company focused on cognitive performance to a global force in the health and wellness space, incorporating supplements, exercise and mental engagement practices that the company says lead to peak performance.
The author of the New York Times best-selling book “Own the Day, Own Your Life,” Marcus hosts a popular podcast on personal growth and spirituality and has led weekend seminars that attempt
to empower attendees to achieve their best selves.
He will appear Thursday night at the Paramount Theatre with Gary Vaynerchuk, a serial entrepreneur and CEO of Vayner Media, where the two will engage in a discussion about wellness, entrepreneurship and designing one’s life around the idea that people should consider happiness as the true indicator of a successful return on investment, not money. The duo will follow up Thursday night’s event with a daylong session of workshops, breakout sessions and more.
We met up with Marcus at Onnit headquarters to talk about fear, self-judgment and the keys to total optimization. Below is a condensed version of that conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can also hear the conversation this week on the Austin360 podcast, "I Love You So Much," at austin360.com/loveaustin360.
American-Statesman: At what stage of your life did you decide to form Onnit? What had you been messing around with businesswise; what did your life look like? What was the idea behind it? How did that all come about?
Aubrey Marcus: I was literally trying everything I could. I worked for a gold-mining company; I sold sex toys; I was in skin care; I did oil and gas; there was a company in Edmonton that I was working with that was developing novel therapeutic treatments for ovarian cancer ... all kinds of crazy things I was dabbling in, nothing being particularly successful. I tried everything, but nothing I really had my heart into. What I had my heart into was getting a little bit better tomorrow than I am today, and being a little bit better today than I was yesterday. And that was a path that I had carried all the way from my youth. So forming Onnit was like, "All right, here it goes. This is the thing I love the most; this is the thing that I’m the most passionate about." Which is pressure. Because if you fail at the thing you’re most passionate about, it doesn’t leave you with as many outs. If the gold mine doesn’t pan out, and it didn’t, who cares? But this is what I was really called to do, so I took the leap, and it’s been one of the greatest blessings of my life.
What made you think that it would be something other people would be interested in, following your path?
Well, I could tell that it worked. I knew that the supplements that my step-mom had given me and the ones that I had researched made an impact. I could tell my brain was sharper when I took the supplements for cognitive improvement. I could tell my body responded better and I had more stamina when I took the ones for physical improvement. But for the brain alone, it was 10 different ingredients, and that was a pain to take, so I thought if we could combine all these things I know are effective into one and then went to the research and found the exact right amounts and the perfect combination, we could make something that can really advance and revolutionize the field. Because at that point most of the things were single-ingredient supplements still. So by combining them with this unique approach, I believed that we could create something that could disrupt the market and be a lot more convenient than trying to piece these things together. And that was really what led to Alpha Brain, our flagship product.
In your book, one of the early steps that you have in approaching your day is to take a freezing cold shower. I’ve heard you talk about the fear people have in turning that cold water on. Do you get the sense that fear is the overriding factor that keeps people from challenging themselves or stepping into a better version of themselves?
It is a factor. I think there’s a lot of forces at work. I think we have internal forces of resistance that want to keep us from growing into our potential, want to keep us from doing things we know will bring us the greatest fruition of what we want. Whether that’s a fear that if we achieve what we’re looking for we will have newfound responsibility and then we might fail and then we might be worse, so it’s better not to try. Maybe there’s some of that. Maybe you’re just afraid of doing the thing itself. I was talking today with someone who does do that, cold exposure and breathing, which is something I practice, and still, knowing after hundreds of times of doing it, we will still go a week without doing and then we’ll look at ourselves and go, "Why didn’t I do that this week? I feel better every time I do it. But, still, for some reason I didn’t do it." That’s the funny aspect with human nature: We really know what we should do and what will make us feel better, but some part of us doesn’t want to do that. Maybe we feel like we don’t deserve to feel better. Maybe we’re in some cycle of self-judgment, where we feel like we deserve to be feeling exactly the same way that we do and that we don’t deserve to be happy and comfortable and confident. It’s really a multiplicity of interesting psychological factors that can hold us back, but all it takes is taking that one step and using what I call "mental override" to just push you to do that very next thing that you know you should do.
What was it that brought you and Gary Vaynerchuk together? Who sought out whom and why?
I think our friendship really evolved when we got to step on the basketball court together, and that was where we gained another level of respect. I think we do have very similar and different messages. He’s very motivated to keep pushing and to keep going and to shed the ideas about what you should do and what parents told you you should do. When he really started talking about the return on investment on life being happiness and not money, that’s when I think our messages really synced up and aligned in an interesting way. He’s incredibly tactical and incredibly knowledgeable about how to push through those forces of resistance on that side, and I’m really knowledgeable on all of the other different forces of resistance that we might encounter in all of the other elements of life.
What do you say to the people who think, "OK, I’m ready to achieve my goal, I just don’t know what it is"? What do you see in people or hear from people that are the main points of blockage?
I almost think that you get to the message less by addition than by subtraction. Instead of thinking you need to figure it out, you need to figure out what it’s not. If you have an idea, go for it. I figured out it wasn’t gold mining, it wasn’t finance, it wasn’t all of these other things that I was doing. I always knew kind of that human optimization was where I wanted to go, but I had to explore other things and eliminate possibilities until I had to accept the same whisper that I’ve had in my head the whole time. It’s by removing all these counterpressures and all of these other ideas that we’re actually able to listen to ourselves. And I think we do really know what we’re here to do.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Attorney General William P. Barr said during his confirmation hearing in January that serving in his future post was "not the same" as representing President Trump and pledged to make law enforcement decisions based only on facts and the law -- not politics.
But his handling of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has called that vow into question. On Wednesday, Mr. Barr defended his actions before the Senate Judiciary Committee, even as he put forward an interpretation of the evidence in a favorable light for Mr. Trump.
Mr. Barr's dueling performances underscored tensions inherent in the role of the attorney general, pitting the ideal that the nation's top law enforcement official should be independent of politics and enforce a neutral understanding of the rule of law against the reality that he or she is politically appointed and part of any administration's team.
As Democrats criticized Mr. Barr, he exuded an air of impassive confidence and suggested that their anger at him stemmed only from a misguided desire to use the legal system to achieve their political goal of ousting Mr. Trump from the White House.
"No, I didn't exonerate" Mr. Trump of obstruction, Mr. Barr said at one point. "I said that we did not believe there was sufficient evidence to establish an obstruction offense, which is the job of the Justice Department."
He suggested Democrats shift their focus to the presidential election: "That's a very democratic process. But we're out of it, and we have to stop using the criminal justice process as a political weapon."
But even as Mr. Barr urged a high standard before accusing political opponents of a crime, Democrats accused him of putting his finger too much on the opposite end of that scale -- acting more like a White House counsel, who helps the president work through legal policy issues to achieve his agenda, or even a personal lawyer, who mounts a vigorous defense against any accusations of wrongdoing.
"You've chosen to be the president's lawyer," said Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii.
How Mr. Barr has approached his responsibilities -- and whether he can be trusted by Americans of all political stripes to use his power as the nation's top law enforcement official evenhandedly -- was one of the main focuses of the hearing. Lawmakers pressed Mr. Barr about his March 24 letter to Congress in which he purported to describe the bottom-line conclusions of Mr. Mueller's report, weeks before he allowed lawmakers and the public to read a redacted version of the actual document.
Did Mr. Barr use his powers neutrally, giving an honest broker's account of Mr. Mueller's findings to tell the public what it needed to know while the process of redacting certain portions of the actual report unfolded? Or did he abuse them to distort public understanding in a way that created a more favorable impression for the president and allow that version of events to harden?
The report gave Mr. Barr's critics fodder to accuse him of using his role to do the president a political favor. As the recipient of Mr. Mueller's report, Mr. Barr was in a position to put forth a sanitized version -- using many of Mr. Mueller's words out of context in a way that made the president look better.
For example, Mr. Barr quoted a fragment of one of Mr. Mueller's sentences about how the evidence did not prove there had been any agreement between the campaign and Russia, but omitted a lead-in about how the Trump campaign had many contacts with Russians and had welcomed Russian intervention.
And while Mr. Mueller's investigators wrote about several actions by Mr. Trump that seemed to meet the criteria for obstruction, while stopping short of deciding whether to accuse Mr. Trump of that crime because the Justice Department has said sitting presidents cannot be indicted, Mr. Barr explained none of that. He simply declared that Mr. Mueller had made no call, leaving it to the attorney general to decide that the evidence did not support obstruction charges.
Still, in other ways Mr. Barr's performance has not lived up to critics' fears about him. During his confirmation hearing, Democrats expressed worries that he would invoke his broad view of executive power to tell Mr. Trump that the Constitution puts him, as president, above the law. Mr. Barr has written that obstruction laws cannot cover a president who abuses his official powers to impede an investigation, and argued for a sweeping view of a president's authority as commander in chief.
Against that backdrop, it was notable on Wednesday that he invoked no constitutional theories to justify clearing Mr. Trump of obstructing justice. Rather, he interpreted the evidence in a light favorable to Mr. Trump, arguing that it was ambiguous and fell short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that any of his actions met the criteria for obstruction.
But Mr. Barr at times seemed to channel the vantage point of a defense lawyer for Mr. Trump that was at odds with the image of an attorney general who enforces the law dispassionately. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and a former prosecutor, pressed him to explain how it was not obstruction of justice for Mr. Trump to dangle a pardon before his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, while urging him not to "flip" and cooperate with investigators.
"What the president's lawyers would say is that the president's statements about 'flipping' are quite clear and express and uniformly the same, which is by 'flipping,' he meant succumbing to pressure on unrelated cases to lie and compose in order to get lenient treatment," Mr. Barr said. "It's a discouraging 'flipping' in that sense. It's not obstruction."
Before Mr. Barr's testimony, the Justice Department released a letter that Mr. Mueller had written to the attorney general on March 27, complaining that Mr. Barr's letter to Congress three days earlier had inadequately described his investigation's findings and was causing public confusion. Mr. Mueller urged the Justice Department to immediately release the report's two executive summaries.
That revelation put new light on Mr. Barr's handling of his role when he testified before a House subcommittee on April 4, a day after The New York Times reported that some members of Mr. Mueller's team were unhappy about his portrayal of their work. Asked then whether he knew what they were frustrated about, he said he did not -- and said nothing about Mr. Mueller's letter.
On Wednesday, Mr. Barr rejected accusations that he had been misleading, arguing that complaints by Mr. Mueller's subordinates to others were different from Mr. Mueller's letter asking him to put out more information.
"Masterful hairsplitting," said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island and another former prosecutor.
Mr. Barr was unapologetic about the fact that being attorney general meant that it was his call to reject Mr. Mueller's request to immediately put out the summaries and instead wait several weeks and then release the document at once.
Mr. Mueller's "work concluded when he sent his report to the attorney general."
"At that point, it was my baby," he said, adding, "It was my decision how and when to make it public, not Bob Mueller's."

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? J. David Goodman, a metro reporter, discussed the tech he's using.
What tech tools do you, a metro reporter covering New York, rely on to stay on top of your beat?
The most important tech for me is incredibly basic: a phone that doubles as a recorder, a laptop, notebooks, pens and a portable phone charger. I pretty much spend my days toggling among messaging apps (iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal), email, Twitter and the phone.
I've also been spending more quality time recently with publicly available data, which is a gateway to hours on Google Sheets or Excel to put together stories related to campaign finance and lobbying. But the best way to stay on top of the beat is still to check in with people regularly, especially in person. Coffee can often be the most effective technology for generating newspaper stories.
ls there any tech you've stopped using?
I don't use Facebook at all for life or work anymore, and I've tried to limit my Twitter intake. Twitter is incredibly useful for covering politics and breaking news; less so for getting insight into a secretive company like Amazon or for the beat I'm now on, which is looking into the intersection of moneyed interests and political power in the New York area. For that, messages are the currency and, even more so, good old fashioned face-to-face meetings.
I also recently activated Screen Time on my phone, so I now feel a nagging counter running in the back of my mind when I'm using Twitter or Instagram for anything other than work. That has caused me to use those apps a lot less. Unfortunately, the Screen Time app defaults to count messages as social networking -- but that's work for me!
I also am trying a personal challenge of not taking my phone out of my pocket in an elevator. It's harder than you would think.
What are the New York-specific apps that you love or hate?
I love the app for the local public radio station, which is easy to use and helpful for monitoring the mayor or governor when he jumps on to the radio station at a moment's notice (something Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is particularly fond of doing).
For getting around town, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's app is indispensable. The subway system is bad now, but when I grew up in New York City, the subways were a total mystery; you never knew when the train was going to come. Now at least that small uncertainty is gone: You know it's not going to be here for eight minutes, so maybe a Citi Bike is faster.
That's another app I love, the one for the bike-sharing system, mostly for the serendipity of how it makes you navigate the city in a new way, finding a bike and then trying to figure out where you can drop it off. Sometimes it brings me to new parts of neighborhoods I've been to a million times.
I probably never felt as modern as I did one evening a few years back while biking over the Brooklyn Bridge on a Citi Bike, directions for my destination coming through from Google Maps, whatever music I was listening to interrupted by a call from the copy desk whose questions about a story running the next day I answered while coasting down to Brooklyn Heights.
You've written about tech companies like Google and Amazon invading New York . How is the tech industry changing the city?
One thing people who don't live in New York City sometimes fail to appreciate is how big it really is. Even some people who live here don't realize just how easy it is for the city to absorb change. Take Google: It moved into Chelsea without many people there even noticing.
Now, there have of course been changes to the city that come from technology companies locating here, but they're not always obvious or easily separated from other industries, like fashion, advertising or finance, especially when you're talking about Chelsea and Lower Manhattan, where many of the new start-ups are congregating. Are new coffee shops sprouting up because of new tech companies? How much can we blame them for skyrocketing rents? Hard for me to say.
Amazon would have been different because it was going to land in an area that is not, at the moment, a hub of tech. So the presence of 25,000 Amazon workers would have been more obvious and the changes that followed more easily ascribed to them.
But those changes are happening anyway, even in the Long Island City neighborhood where Amazon proposed building a major corporate campus. In the last few years, multiple residential towers have sprouted up blocks away from where Amazon was going to build, many of which have not even opened yet.
And Amazon already has a few thousand employees scattered about other areas of New York, including 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Most people who pass by have no idea the company is even there.
Many venture capitalists like to think of New York as the next Silicon Valley. Is it getting there?
It's getting there, but the cultures are not the same. I was talking recently with a person who deals with a lot of technology companies, someone who is trying to bridge the gap, and they talked about how different some people from big tech companies out West can be from people you meet in New York.
I think you saw that most dramatically with Amazon's flat-footed rollout. The company, from the start, thought it would be welcomed because it was bringing so many jobs. At the first news conference, the Amazon team was genuinely surprised by the onslaught of questions from reporters. Many New Yorkers were equally baffled that the company, which has in many ways taken over the world of commerce, could be so naïve, and so unprepared.
The decision by Amazon to cancel its plans struck fear in a lot of business and political leaders that other tech companies would decide that New York City is not a place they want to be after all. But so far, nothing like that has appeared to have happened. Google is expanding in New York, as is Facebook.
Outside of work, what tech product are you personally obsessed with?
I spend so much of the day staring at various screens that when I get home, I try to stay away from them as much as possible. Books are a great technology.
That said, I end up spending a lot of time on the Sonos app, mainly because my son, who is 4, is obsessed with the possibilities of Spotify for discovering new music and dancing to it. First it was the K-pop group BTS; now it is "Moana."
Choosing music is one of the few things he's allowed to do on my phone, so he really takes it to heart. And now I have the words to the "Moana" soundtrack in my head. (You're welcome.)
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr testified in front of Congress Wednesday morning in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearing had a number of tense moments throughout. Here are some of the reactions to the hearing.
Asha Rangappa, former FBI Special Agent and CNN analyst, had some strong words on Barr's response to the committee.

- https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1123603827356307456

Donald Trump Jr. responded to Barr's comment on his use of the word "spying" in a different congressional hearing earlier this year by bringing up the claim that the Obama administration spied on President Trump's campaign.

- https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1123649288163164160

Former Presidential candidate Evan McMullin was disgusted by how Barr failed to say he was troubled by the Trump campaign's willingness to receive Russian help in the 2016 election.

- https://twitter.com/EvanMcMullin/status/1123611500902481921

Barr himself shot back at the Democratic members of the committee during a tense conversation between himself and Connecticut Democratic Sen. Dick Blumenthal.

- “The job of the Justice Department is now over," Barr said. "We have to stop using the criminal justice process as a political weapon."

After the hearing Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the head of the committee, said unless something came up, there would be no more hearings about the Mueller probe.

- "It's over. If there's any dispute about a conversation, then (Robert Mueller will) come but I'm not going to retry the case. I'm not calling (former White House counsel Don) McGahn. It is over."

Amber Phillips of The Washington Post wrote that Graham forsook the facts to play politics and defend the president.

- "In the opening moments of this hearing, Graham made his allegiances clear. He’s going to use his significant weight as head of this committee not to investigate whether the president committed a crime or obstructed an independent investigation or lied to the American people, per the Mueller report. He’s going to put all that aside and dig into conspiracy theories about how the investigation got started in the first place."

CNN's Chris Cillizza noted how interesting he found Barr's response to Sen. Kamala Harris' question.

- "Harris asked Barr a simple question: Did anyone in the White House ask or suggest that he open an investigation into a person or people? Barr was taken aback, asking Harris to repeat the question. He then said he wasn't entirely sure what she meant by the word 'suggest.' All of that potentially suggests — ahem — that someone in the White House has either asked or suggested that Barr and the DOJ look into a matter. Which is interesting, to say the least."


Sen. Mike Lee defended Barr by calling the Mueller probe a weapon used by Democrats aimed at Trump.

- "Time and time again," Lee said. "The president’s political adversaries have exploited the Mueller probe, its mere existence, to spread baseless innuendo in an effort to undermine the legitimacy of the 2016 election and the effectiveness of this administration."

Former FBI Director James Comey lamented in a New York Times op-ed how far Barr has fallen.

- "How could he write and say things about the report by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, that were apparently so misleading that they prompted written protest from the special counsel himself? How could Mr. Barr go before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and downplay President Trump’s attempt to fire Mr. Mueller before he completed his work?"


Barr was scheduled for another hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday but announced that he will no longer attend.

Remembering Lugar as a political centrist

Texto completo: One of the last major pieces of legislation David Pryor had to deal with before retiring from the U.S. Senate in 1997 was a rewrite of federal farm policy.
A farm bill, always, is a challenge to every Washington lawmaker, even those with enormous urban centers; New York, California, Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the top ten dairy producing states. (Arkansas ranks 47th.) Too, a farm bill includes elements such as the Special Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) that provides aid to needy families, town and country.
A provision that may delight the agriculture community in Wyoming can send farmers in Arkansas into a sputtering rage. The balancing act involves, and tests, relationships not only between House and Senate but among colleagues in each chamber, even within states. Check with any of the six members of the Arkansas congressional delegation. Or recall last December's vote on the newest version, a $870 billion baby that saw Senators Boozman and Cotton, both Republicans, on opposing sides (Boozman yea, Cotton nay).
But the '96 legislation: Pryor was appointed to a conference committee to resolve differences between House and Senate versions. Pointedly dissatisfied with what he argued was its bias toward corporate agribusiness at the expense of smaller, family operations ("Doomsday for American farmers," Pryor called it) the Arkansan voted against it. So did his home state friend, Dale Bumpers. But 21 of their fellow Democrats, many from neighboring states, joined with the Senate's Republican majority to ratify the bill.
The tug of war sprang to mind early this week when the New York Times published a photograph of Pryor and some other senators, huddled over a stack of documents during a '96 farm bill meeting. Alongside Pryor was the Republican chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Richard Lugar of Indiana, who died this week. And now you know this column isn't about Pryor, or the farm bill; or about Lugar, in whose obituary the picture appeared, but about something larger than them: a political center that that keeps getting smaller.
Not that Lugar or the others in mention were small. Reliably conservative by the standard of his day, Lugar was a Senate giant, a genial intellect esteemed for his expertise in not only farm policy but foreign affairs. The former specialty (Lugar owned a soybean farm) helped make him the longest-serving member of Congress — 36 years — in his state's history, while his perceived preoccupation with the latter (he would also chair the Foreign Relations Committee) eventually made him vulnerable to a 2012 primary opponent well to his right.
Like Arkansas's J. William Fulbright, an earlier chairman of Foreign Relations and to whom he was favorably compared, Lugar would eventually be viewed by his electorate as too concerned with matters abroad, "out of touch." (Fulbright lost his 1974 reelection primary to Bumpers.) And as did Fulbright, Lugar would buck a president of his own party: The Arkansan vigorously challenged President Johnson's Vietnam policy; the Indianan resisted Ronald Reagan's aims in the Philippines and South Africa. And then made the world safer by devising a program to neuter 7,500 nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union that had been targeted at the U.S. and its allies.
That innovative arms security initiative: Lugar persuaded a reluctant Congress by working closely with a key Senate Democrat, Georgia's Sam Nunn. Bipartisanship was a Lugar characteristic.
His cosponsors of significant, sometimes crucial, legislation included dozens of Democrats, including Pryor and Bumpers (21 and 9 bills, respectively) and, later, another Arkansan (and Ag Committee chair), Sen. Blanche Lincoln (10 bills).
More: As much for his eagerness to seek common ground, Lugar was admired for the civility that was his parallel constant. But times were changing. Lugar's instinct for reason and logic over bombast and hyperbole eventually opened the door to a far-right opponent.
Pryor and Bumpers, who counted the Hoosier a personal friend notwithstanding their differences, were appalled at the primary's outcome. When a man like Lugar could be ousted by his own party, Bumpers told me, "this country's in trouble."
Lugar himself feared as much. In semi-retirement he created an institute at Indiana University to encourage bipartisanship and comity in, a denuclearization of, American politics. And late last year, with multiple investigations of the Trump administration underway, Lugar helped draft a letter urging the sitting Senate to ensure "that partisanship or self-interest not replace national interest." Almost four dozen former senators, including Pryor and Lincoln, were co-signers; were he alive, Bumpers certainly would have joined them. Centrists, all.
Lugar's attempts to de-weaponize politics, to restore the center, has yet to bear fruit. He tried. Maybe someday.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - They all tell a similar story: They ran apps that helped people limit the time they and their children spent on iPhones. Then Apple created its own screen-time tracker. And then Apple made staying in business very, very difficult.
Over the past year, Apple has removed or restricted at least 11 of the 17 most downloaded screen-time and parental-control apps, according to an analysis by The New York Times and Sensor Tower, an app-data firm. Apple has also clamped down on a number of lesser-known apps.
In some cases, Apple forced companies to remove features that allowed parents to control their children's devices or that blocked children's access to certain apps and adult content. In other cases, it simply pulled the apps from its App Store.
Some app makers with thousands of paying customers have shut down. Most others say their futures are in jeopardy.
"They yanked us out of the blue with no warning," said Amir Moussavian, chief executive of OurPact, the top parental-control iPhone app, with more than 3 million downloads. In February, Apple pulled the app, which accounted for 80 percent of OurPact's revenue, from its App Store.
"They are systematically killing the industry," Moussavian said.
The screen-time app makers are the latest companies to suddenly find themselves both competing against Apple and at the mercy of the tech titan. By controlling the iPhone App Store, where companies find some of their most lucrative customers, Apple has unusual power over the fortunes of other corporations.
Tammy Levine, an Apple spokeswoman, said Apple removed or required changes to the apps because they could gain too much information from users' devices. She said the timing of Apple's moves was not related to its introduction of similar tools.
In response to this article, Philip W. Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said in emails to some customers that Apple "acted extremely responsibly in this matter, helping to protect our children from technologies that could be used to violate their privacy and security."
Executives at the app makers believe they are being targeted because their apps could hurt Apple's business. Apple's tools, they add, aren't as aggressive about limiting screen time and don't provide as many options.
"Their incentives aren't really aligned for helping people solve their problem," said Fred Stutzman, chief executive of Freedom, a screen-time app with more than 770,000 downloads before Apple removed it in August. "Can you really trust that Apple wants people to spend less time on their phones?"
Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said at a conference this month that Apple had added tools to help people manage their phone use. "We don't want people using their phones all the time," he said. "This has never been an objective for us."
On Thursday, two of the most popular parental-control apps, Kidslox and Qustodio, filed a complaint with the European Union's competition office. Kidslox said business had plummeted since Apple forced changes to its app that made it less useful than Apple's tool.
Apple is facing other accusations that it is abusing its dominant position to lift itself and bury rivals - an issue that has become more important as the iPhone maker expands into new markets like television, news and gaming.
Spotify complained to European regulators last month that Apple used the App Store to give its Apple Music service an unfair advantage over Spotify's app. Dutch regulators announced this month that they would investigate whether Apple abused its control of the App Store.
In the United States, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic candidate for president, recently suggested separating the App Store from Apple as part of her proposal to rein in the American tech giants.
'No Reason, No Detail'
The app makers said they were most frustrated by the process of meeting Apple's sudden demands. In many cases, Apple alerted them that their apps would be removed - and their businesses crippled - via a short note, according to correspondence viewed by The Times.
When app makers asked for more information, responses were often perfunctory and slow in coming.
"As a developer who's been on the App Store for 10 years, I would expect some courtesy from Apple of at least a phone call to explain what we're doing wrong," said Suren Ramasubbu, the head of Mobicip, a parental-control app that had about 2.5 million downloads this year, about 70 percent of them on iPhones.
On Jan. 19, Ramasubbu received a message from Apple that said he had 30 days to change the Mobicip app or it would be removed from the App Store. "If you have any questions about this information, please reply to this message to let us know," the note said. "Best regards, App Store Review."
Over the next 27 days, Ramasubbu responded four times seeking more information. He eventually resubmitted the app with changes he hoped would satisfy Apple's demands.
Then, with Mobicip's deadline just a few days away, Apple responded three times to his earlier detailed questions - with virtually the same message: "Your app uses public APIs in an unapproved manner, which does not comply with guideline 2.5.1 of the App Store Review Guidelines."
"We hear you loud and clear," Ramasubbu responded on the morning of Feb. 19, Apple's deadline. He begged for answers: Could Apple tell him what he needed to do to keep Mobicip on iPhones?
"Any general direction, clue or specific guidance will be deeply appreciated. We have been one of the pioneers among parental control apps on the App Store over 10 long years and have always been playing by the rules," he wrote. "Please point us in the right direction and we can take it from there."
Five hours later, Apple responded with a 14-word message: "Your app has an unresolved issue and has been removed from the App Store."
"No reason, no detail," Ramasubbu said. "Suddenly we don't have a business anymore."

Taylor Swift to perform at iHeartRadio Wango Tango in June NEW YORK | Taylor Swift just released a new song and now she’s ready to perform it live.
The pop star will take the stage at the iHeartRadio Wango Tango concert on June 1 at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California.
Swift released “ME!” — featuring Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco — last week. She will also open Wednesday’s Billboard Music Awards with a performance of the song.
Daniel Radcliffe
to return to London stage in Beckett play
LONDON | Daniel Radcliffe is returning to the London stage in a Samuel Beckett double bill.
The Old Vic Theatre says the former “Harry Potter” star will appear alongside Alan Cumming in a production of Beckett’s bleak comedy “Endgame” that opens in February. It will be performed along with Beckett’s rarely produced short play “Rough For Theatre II.”
‘Game of Thrones’ actors sent
well wishes to hospice patient
PROVIDENCE, R.I. | Actors from “Game of Thrones” have sent greetings and well wishes to an 88-year-old hospice patient in Rhode Island.

Obamas unveil slate of series, documentaries
for Netflix NEW YORK | Barack and Michelle Obama on Tuesday unveiled a slate of projects they are preparing for Netflix, a year after the former president and first lady signed a deal with the streaming platform. The Obamas’ production company, Higher Ground Productions, on Tuesday announced a total of seven films and series that Barack Obama said will entertain but also “educate, connect and inspire us all.” Higher Ground is producing a feature film on Frederick Douglass, adapted from David W. Blight’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography. Also in the works is a documentary series that adapts Michael Lewis’ “Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy,” the “Moneyball” author’s 2018 best-seller about government servants working under the political appointees of Donald Trump’s administration. The production company’s first release will be Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert’s Sundance Film Festival documentary “American Factory,” about a Chinese-owned factory in post-industrial Ohio. Netflix and Higher Ground also acquired Jim LeBrecht and Nicole Newnham’s “Crip Camp,” a documentary about a summer camp for disabled teenager founded in upstate New York in the early 1970s. The Obamas are also developing an upstairs-downstairs drama set in post-WWII New York titled “Bloom,” and an adaptation of The New York Times “Overlooked” obituary column, about deaths unreported by the paper. A half-hour show for preschoolers titled “Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents” will instruct kids about food. “We love this slate because it spans so many different interests and experiences, yet it’s all woven together with stories that are relevant to our daily lives,” Michelle Obama said. “We think there’s something here for everyone — moms and dads, curious kids, and anyone simply looking for an engaging, uplifting watch at the end of a busy day.” The projects are to be released over the next several years.

How Gateses help bring makeovers

Texto completo: Melinda Gates has always had an independent streak. When she was still Melinda French and a young employee working at Microsoft in 1987, Bill Gates flirted with her in the parking lot and asked if she would go out with him in two weeks.
"That's not spontaneous enough for me," she told him. "Ask me out closer to the date."
An hour or two later, Bill Gates phoned her and invited her out for that evening. "Is this spontaneous enough for you?" he asked.
And then they lived happily ever after.
Actually, not exactly. Melinda Gates has written a smart new memoir, "The Moment of Lift," recounting how she ended up a feminist - and arguing that the American workplace needs a makeover.
Some of her story is deeply personal. She endured an abusive relationship. She felt out of place in Microsoft's high-testosterone environment. And then she struggled to forge an equal relationship with Bill (it helped that she beat him at a math game).
I hugely admire what Bill and Melinda Gates have done to alleviate global suffering. Hundreds of thousands of children now survive each year who wouldn't have without the Gateses' money, advocacy and ingenuity. They have also been steadfast in advocating changes in tax laws - raising the inheritance tax, for example - to create a more fair society.
During interviews with Bill and Melinda over many years, I've often tried to get them to dish on their relationship, as a way of spicing up discussions about global health and their foundation work. They resolutely resisted my interrogations.
Fortunately, in her book, Melinda comes clean on marital tensions - the kind in any relationship - as a way of recounting her feminist voyage. 
One of Melinda's first challenges came in the harsh, male-dominated techie culture at Microsoft. "It was just so brash, so argumentative and competitive, with people fighting to the end on every point," she writes. She began thinking about quitting.
Then she found a woman colleague, Charlotte Guyman, who felt the same. With other women employees, they began to create oases in Microsoft where courtesy was not seen as a sign of weakness. A critical mass of women employees helped civilize the company.
Yet while women were 35% of the computer science graduates in the U.S. in 1987, when Melinda graduated from Duke with such a degree, the share has now dropped to 19%. Only 2% of venture capital partners in America are women. Much of the U.S. workplace remains tilted against women, especially moms.
"We're sending our daughters into a workplace that was designed for our dads - set up on the assumption that employees had partners who would stay home to do the unpaid work of caring for family," Melinda writes.
After the marriage, in 1994, Melinda still struggled, and one flashpoint was the annual letter that Bill had been writing for the foundation they had established. Melinda was co-chair of the foundation and wanted to write it with him in 2013. Bill didn't like the idea. "We both got angry," Melinda writes, adding: "I thought we were going to kill each other. I felt, Well, this just might end the marriage right here.'"
In the end, Bill wrote the letter for 2013 but included a section by Melinda. In 2014, it became a joint letter, but mostly written by Bill. Finally, in 2015 it morphed into a truly balanced letter.
That's how equal marriages are built: not just on romance but also on hard work and grumpy compromises. And equal marriages help build fairer societies. When their eldest child, Jenn, began school an hour round-trip drive away, Bill volunteered to take her to school two days a week. That changed the norms, and abruptly other dads at the school began sharing the driving as well.
Nicholas Kristof writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Impeaching Trump will only help him

Texto completo: President Trump has called the Mueller investigation a "witch hunt" nearly two hundred times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch. After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert Mueller definitively declared "the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." He didn't do it.
Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up. As Mueller put it, "unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."
This lack of an "underlying crime" is the source of Trump's justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You'd be angry and frustrated. You'd want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.
For two years, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of "treason" and crimes of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia - evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn't end it. He didn't obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials. The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff. Remember, the only reason Mueller knew about his private exchanges with McGahn is because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn's cooperation. The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to the New York Times, "that investigators would not have learned of otherwise." This is evidence of Trump's cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel's report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to purse impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make my day." Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump's reelection. First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president. Second, Trump's supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d'état, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election. And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump's approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Trump's tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating. Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Trump's returns to assess how "the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a president"? Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.
Both the Democrats' attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Trump's privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Texto completo: Before the star-studded endorsements, a Super Bowl ad and hundreds of Instagram photos featuring yellow merchandise, Bumble founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd sent her co-workers a photo of two pink tennis balls.
Wolfe Herd pasted Bumble stickers on the balls for the
dating app maker’s early marketing campaign that featured the slogan: “The Ball is in Her Court.”
Alex Williamson, now the company’s chief brand officer, remembered Wolfe Herd telling the group: “Wouldn’t it be cool if one day we made this company big enough that Serena Williams would partner with us?”
Now, more than four years later, that slogan and goal has become a reality for Austin-based Bumble, which has shifted from just dating to also include networking and friend-finding on its app. In January, the company launched a yearlong partnership with Williams through its #InHerCourt campaign, which included a 30-second Super Bowl ad.
After launching as a startup in a saturated dating app industry less than five years ago, marketing experts say that Bumble has used numerous strategies to cultivate a brand that now aims to represent female empowerment — a message that can help secure a more profitable future for the company.
Since its founding in 2014, Bumble has grown from being a women-focused dating app to a company that markets itself as an empowering tool for women to make friends, make business contacts and to beat harassment on the internet. The app has more than 50 million users.
That shift in messaging worked, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, associate director of research at the University of Texas' Center for Sports Communication and Media.
“I think it shows that this brand is really on the rise,” Close Scheinbaum said of the partnership with Williams.
Growing pains
Bumble followed in the footsteps of other e-dating companies like Tinder, which came onto the scene in 2012 and quickly became one of the most popular dating apps on the market.
The dual extends beyond friendly competition, though. Match Group, which owns Tinder and has previously tried to buy Bumble, sued the company in March 2018, claiming patent infringement and misuse of intellectual property.
Shortly after, Bumble responded with a lawsuit claiming that Match Group stole trade secrets and more. The company sought $400 million in damages but later asked the court to drop the suit.
Although it's hard to miss news about the company's legal feuds, Close Scheinbaum said it's unlikely that the headlines will have a negative impact on the company.
"The company is doing a good job standing up for itself and its values — especially for women — by speaking out via advertising, and this may be appreciated by consumers who may be aware of what they are dealing with legally with its competitor," she said.
Close Scheinbaum, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on the e-dating market in 2006, said Bumble's bigger challenge will be fighting to stay on top in a more mature e-dating market.
Tinder does not release information on its total number of users, but says that more than 30 billion "matches" have been made on the app.
Bumble's "unique selling proposition" — letting women make the first move — continues to be an original message in an otherwise saturated e-dating market, Close Scheinbaum said. However, the company could face challenges as the number of dating apps grow.
"Unfortunately, sometimes success comes with growing pains and hardships, such as competitors coming for market share and ideas that were once original are no longer a” unique selling proposition, Close Scheinbaum said.
More than a dating app
The company has gone beyond its app to market its women-focused message, helping state Rep. Morgan Meyer, R-Dallas, write a bill that would make it a crime to send a lewd photo without the recipient's consent. The bill includes content sent via text message, social media or online dating apps.
The measure aligns with Bumble’s mission of combating so-called cyberflashing on platforms across the internet. Bumble already bans shirtless selfies, misogynistic language, nudity, guns and drugs in photos on its app.
The Texas House approved the bill this week. The state Senate has not yet taken up the measure.
Bumble has been successful at marketing its message across multiple platforms, also known as integrated brand promotion, Close Scheinbaum said.
That was on display in September, when Bumble took out a full-page ad in The New York Times that read “Believe Women” one day after Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, alleging that then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her at a house party in the 1980s.
Wolfe Herd shared a photo of the ad and the Times front page on Twitter and announced that the company would donate $25,000 to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.
This month, the company made an even bigger leap into print, launching its own lifestyle magazine.
The first edition of Bumble Mag features 100 pages of interviews, advice, product guides and more.
And last year, Bumble and the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers announced a multiyear partnership that included an "empowerment badge" featured on the front of team uniforms. Bumble will pay roughly $20 million over three years, a person familiar with the deal told Bloomberg.
“This is a brand that cares about women, that speaks to women and that’s really important in their integrated brand promotion,” Close Scheinbaum said.
A Super Bowl ad
That attention to a broader message of female empowerment, experts say, helped grow the brand to a point where it could catch the attention of a tennis superstar like Williams.
With help from Nashville-based marketing agency FlyteVu, Williams and the Bumble team decided on Thanksgiving that they’d kick off their yearlong campaign with a 30-second Super Bowl ad.
“It really came down to how are we going to launch this partnership in a big way,” said Laura Hutfless, a founding partner at FlyteVu.
But that left the group with less than two months to prepare.
“I think the beauty of working with a brand like Bumble is they can work quickly” because their team is small and mighty, Hutfless said. “And we’ve worked together for so many years.”
Bumble’s ability to snag a world-famous athlete like Williams, a singer like Meghan Trainor or an actress like Kate Hudson shows that it’s a well-funded company, said Debra Zahay-Blatz, a St. Edward’s University marketing professor.
“It says that they have enough money to pay a celebrity,” Zahay-Blatz said. “That’s interesting to me because most startups can’t.”
The company does not disclose financial details of celebrity partnerships, but a spokesperson for Bumble said that many high-profile women who have supported the company "have done so out of authentic love of the brand."
However, it’s clear that the company is gaining ground financially. In September, Wolfe Herd told CNBC that the company’s growth is outpacing expectations and an initial public offering of stock could help fuel its global expansion.
“We are at our annual run rate of $200 million for 2018, and we’re only in year three,” Wolfe Herd said in the interview. “We’ve been a profitable business since year two.”
The company generates revenue using a subscription model that offers some free features and charges for additional services.
In a sea of dating apps, Bumble stands out as one of the few companies that frequently uses celebrity endorsements to promote its brand, according to Zahay-Blatz.
“Not a lot of dating apps and social media sites do that,” Zahay-Blatz said. “You don't really see a particular app taking such a strong position in terms of celebrity endorsements.”
Dating app Tinder has taken some steps to involve celebrities in its promotion. In November, Jonathan Van Ness and Antoni Porowski from Netflix’s “Queer Eye” TV series sat down for Tinder’s video series on dating.
Hutfless, who helps Bumble pull together celebrity partnerships at FlyteVu, said Bumble remains successful at leveraging talent because the brand has a mission that’s clear to consumers.
“For a brand to remain relevant, you have to be entrenched in the pop culture conversation, which Bumble has done so well,” Hutfless said. “What talent does is just amplify that message.”

Take me out to the ... game of life?

Texto completo: I love God and my country and my family and my friends and my synagogue and my writing and I also really love golf. Two bad knees and the rehab after their replacement have put a crimp in my game, but I am slowly returning to the links. This is why Tiger Wood's victory at the Masters after over a decade of physical and emotional challenges was so inspiring. Every old guy was happy for him, and I am now officially an old guy.
My friend Tom Friedman, who writes the foreign affairs op-ed column for the New York Times, also loves golf with a true passion and also was happy for Tiger. On April 15 he wrote a wonderful piece titled, "Tiger Woods and the Game of Life." Tom brought up my favorite philosophical/bar room/drinking debate, and that is this deep and profound existential mystery: "What sport is most like life?"
So, dear readers, now it is your turn. This is your God Squad homework assignment for the week. Write to me and tell me which sport you think wins this debate, but please don't even try to suggest that the sport most like life is:
Polo. Any sport which requires you to buy a horse is not like life.
Hockey. There are no pads in life and not really that much ice, and though there is fighting in life, there is clearly much more fighting in hockey.
Tennis, soccer, basketball. In these sports there is absolutely no chance that old slow people can win unless the only people playing are old slow people.
No, the way I see it there are only really two candidates for the winner of the sport that is most like life. Friedman makes an excellent case for golf in his recent wonderful column. Here is a short excerpt:
"The biggest takeaway for me (of Tiger's victory) is the reminder of the truism that golf is the sport most like life, because it is played on an uneven surface and everything is on you. So good and bad bounces — and self-inflicted mistakes — are built into the game. And so much of success in golf, as in life, is about how you react to those good and bad bounces. Do you quit? Do you throw your club? Do you cheat? Do you whine? Do you blame your caddie?"
Well said. Golf is indeed a possible winner in the debate over which sport is most like life, and Tom has made an excellent case for it ... and yet ... I have another candidate and I think this sport is the true winner: baseball.
Baseball is the game that is most like life because in baseball, as in life, mostly nothing happens.
Then, in baseball as in life, something unexpectedly happens and you have to be ready for it. If you are ready and you hit, catch or throw the ball properly you are a hero, but if you are not ready you are the goat. Sometimes you never have an opportunity to redeem your mistakes. But sometimes (actually quite often) you do, but you just never know when your redemptive opportunity will come. You have to be ready all the time.
Baseball is also the perfect replica of life in that it is a perfect combination of individual effort and teamwork. The result of a baseball game depends partly on what you do alone and partly on what you do as a team. Baseball forms itself into teams, and teams bring in supporters who wear their colors and are brought together rooting for the team. Even if the fans agree on nothing else in life they agree on rooting for the team. Rooting for the same team binds them together with other fans. But the game is not just different teams, it is also about one game with the same rules for everybody (OK, this is the same in golf and the designated hitter does not fit here). It is the same in life. We have different religions and different countries, but we are all supposed to be fans of the same game with the same rules — the rules of justice and compassion, freedom and charity. Life is not always like that, but it should be, and it must be if we are all going to live together.
If you only get one hit out of three at-bats you are a hero, and that is about the same ratio of successful attempts at living a good life. You just have to be good enough sometimes to make your mark and be proud of how you played the game.
Q.E.D. "Quod erat demonstrandum" — thus it has been proved. Baseball is the sport that is most like life.

Decisions by Brazil's Top Court Have Public Questioning Its Credibility

Texto completo: BRASÍLIA, Brazil -- When a Brazilian Supreme Court justice blocked the publication of an article about corruption that named a fellow judge, the backlash on social media was swift. Three days later, the justice backtracked and struck down his own decision.
But this and other recent decisions left many worried that the court's actions were eroding its credibility, hampering its ability to function as a check on government just as the country inaugurated a far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has expressed a disregard for civil liberties.
Mr. Bolsonaro has attacked the news media and voiced admiration for regimes that relied on censorship and repression, such as the dictatorships in Brazil and Chile.
Preserving the court's role as a "moderating power" in this context is particularly important, said Conrado Hübner, a constitutional law professor at the University of São Paulo.
"At a time when we need the judiciary in general, and the Supreme Court in particular, to resist certain authoritarian intrusions, the Supreme Court is in the mud," Mr. Hübner said. "It has put itself in the eye of the fire."
The Supreme Court's press office did not respond to questions from The New York Times. Chief Justice José Toffoli made only a brief comment, saying "the institutions are working properly."
This incident comes after years in which the judiciary won plaudits for leading a sprawling corruption investigation that landed once-unassailable members of other branches of government -- including a former president and a former speaker of the House -- behind bars.
The investigation, which started in 2014, was led by a federal judge, and revealed a scheme involving billions of dollars in graft. The judge who led the anti-corruption crusade, Sérgio Moro, became a symbol of a drive to hold the powerful accountable. He got a rock-star reception in appearances across the country and his face was emblazoned on T-shirts and carnival masks.
Brazilians poured into the streets in support of the judiciary's effort and against the political establishment, which emerged widely discredited.
In October, angered by mounting evidence of public funds being funneled into private pockets and suffering from an economic downturn and escalating violence, Brazilians elected Mr. Bolsonaro as president. He promised to be tough on crime and sweep out the old way of doing politics.
Among his first decisions was to bring Mr. Moro into his cabinet as justice minister.
Last month, thousands of Brazilians returned to the streets -- this time, to protest a Supreme Court ruling they believed would hamper corruption investigations.
The court had decided that cases in which even part of a bribe went to an electoral campaign could be taken out of the hands of the regional courts, which had proven very effective at pursuing them. They would instead be decided in Brazil's electoral courts, which have fewer resources.
Protesters waving Brazil's green and yellow flags and soccer jerseys seemed to echo the anti-establishment marches that propelled Mr. Bolsonaro to the presidency last year. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #STFVergonha, or #ShameSupremeCourt.
Amid the mounting criticism, Chief Justice Toffoli ordered a confidential criminal inquiry into what he called "fake news" and rumors circulating about the Supreme Court and its members, including insults to their honor.
The Supreme Court judge in charge of the inquiry, Alexandre de Moraes, blocked the publication of the article linking Chief Justice Toffoli to players in the wide-ranging corruptions scandal. He also ordered a federal police raid on 10 addresses tied to social media users who had criticized the court.
"I've been on the court for 28 years and I've never seen a decision like this, to take down an article," Justice Marco Aurélio Mello said in an interview on Brazilian television. "The Supreme Court was always engaged in preserving freedom of speech. This is a step backward."
Rulings such as these add to a growing perception that some of the country's top justices see themselves as untouchable, said Eliana Calmon, a former comptroller of the Brazilian National Council of Justice, the body in charge of investigating judges.
"The judiciary acts within a sacred culture that says no one touches any of its members, let alone a member of the Supreme Court," said Ms. Calmon. "It's not possible for the judiciary to remain immune to this new reality."
Justice Moraes eventually allowed the article to run, but the inquiry continues.
The decline of the court's credibility comes from the perception that the law is secondary for the justices, and that they are using their power to protect themselves and their allies from scrutiny -- including the people they are supposed to hold accountable. It is not seen as an impartial institution, said Mr. Hübner, the constitutional law professor.
In 2017, for example, a report by the Federal Police revealed Justice Gilmar Mendes had at least 22 conversations via WhatsApp with Aécio Neves, a prominent senator, while overseeing investigations of Mr. Neves for alleged corruption and fraud, creating an appearance of conflict of interests. Justice Mendes later closed down two investigations targeting the senator.
In separate statements issued at the time, Mr. Neves and Justice Mendes said their contacts were for professional reasons, including the discussion of a political reform measure. No members of the Supreme Court have been formally accused of receiving bribes or manipulating decisions to favor allies.
Mr. Hübner fears that this erosion of confidence in the court may mean its decisions hold less weight, weakening the government's system of checks and balances.
"The judiciary as a whole is corroding its own credibility," said Mr. Hübner. "It could get to a point where it can suffer very serious interventions, or institutional rupture."
Often the controversies arise when a single judge takes action -- suspending a case indefinitely on procedural grounds, or issuing a temporary ruling and then waiting months or even years to put it to a vote by the full court. While allowed under Brazilian law, such actions have prompted allegations of abuse of power from critics.
In 2014, for example, Justice Mendes single-handedly blocked for over one year a decision that would have made corporate campaign donations illegal, despite a majority of his fellow justices already having voted to approve it.
As the court's credibility faces criticism, some worry it could become vulnerable to influence by Mr. Bolsonaro who, during his electoral campaign, threatened to stack the court with more justices if he saw fit.
Making matters more complicated, only the Senate has the power under Brazilian law to launch impeachment proceedings against Supreme Court justices for political infractions.
But lawmakers accused of committing crimes in office, including corruption, can only be tried in the Supreme Court. Currently, several lawmakers, including the president of the Senate, are the target of inquiries overseen by the Supreme Court.
"The body that is supposed to hold them accountable is in their hands," said Ms. Calmon. "So there are no brakes to stop the Supreme Court."

Texto completo: How well I recall, from the distant days of my relative youth, that the singing Pointer Sisters were, and I paraphrase, so excited and just couldn't hide it. Well, it was the '80s, and we were, some of us, rather hopped up.
Decades later, I find myself inclined to contain my enthusiasm.
As a longtime copy editor, I'd no more ask you to rid your writing of exclamation points than I'd ask you to shun adverbs (which I love), semicolons (which I worship) or the word "the." But the overuse of exclamation points - they're just so tempting when you feel the need to turn up the volume on a workaday thought - has lately mushroomed into the standing ovation of punctuation: an obligatory, performative demonstration of enthusiasm meant to reassure their users that they've had a good time or can provide one. That salad? Delicious! That meeting? Productive! In texts and on social media, lest one be read as frostily sarcastic, every greeting must be a "Hi!" and every expression of gratitude a "Thanks!" And the result of all that thrilled intensity? If everything's exciting, ultimately nothing is.
Most thoughts, at least as expressed in writing, would better conclude with the self-effacing chill of the simple period, so that when we do pull up a bang - as the ! is sometimes called - it might make an impression.
I once suggested that writers confine themselves, over the course of a full-length book, to, at most, a dozen exclamation points, to which one writer immediately rejoindered, "Over the course of an entire career, you mean."
I can't aspire to such writerly stoicism, but: (Exclamation) point taken.

Texto completo: Tyler Kepner quotes two baseball historians as saying that Sandy Koufax possessed the best curveball ever. Reading that sentence, I recalled a story told by Jane Leavy, a former sportswriter for The Washington Post who wrote a wonderful biography of Koufax, winner of 165 games for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers between 1955 and 1966.
Leavy invited Koufax to her son's bar mitzvah in Washington, and she showed me a photo of the legendary left-hander demonstrating how to throw a curve to a gaggle of 13-year-old boys. No, one of the youngsters protested, that's not how you do it, my coach showed me a different way. Koufax gently corrected the dissenter but still the lad persisted. Finally the Hall of Famer lost patience and growled, "Look, kid, this is how you throw a goddamn curveball!"
If those neophytes didn't heed Koufax's counsel, many others have. In his engaging book "K: A History of Baseball in 10 Pitches," Kepner describes a dinner in the winter of 2014, when Koufax was seated next to Max Scherzer, the ace right-hander of the Washington Nationals. They talked pitching all evening and "for Scherzer, it was a master class on the curveball," writes the author, who covers baseball for the New York Times.
"My God, could you imagine a better person in life to ever talk to about throwing a curveball?" Scherzer told Kepner. "I literally sat there on my iPhone just writing down notes. 'How are you doing this, what do you do on that?' There's definitely some principles I still think about from that conversation."
That scene embodies a basic theme from Kepner's book. Pitching is best taught through the ancient system of apprenticeship. Wisdom is passed down from master to initiate, coach to player, father to son. (And let's not forget Mike Montgomery, who won a World Series with the Chicago Cubs - he perfected his curveball by throwing to his mother, a former college softball player.)
This teacher/student relationship imparts more than technique. It conveys the most critical quality a pitcher (or any athlete, for that matter) really needs: self-confidence. Fred Martin, a coach for the Cubs, taught Bruce Sutter how to throw a split-finger fastball and something else as well. "With Fred's personality, he knew what to say around me to get me relaxed," says Sutter, a relief pitcher with 300 career saves. "He knew hollering at me is not gonna work. Bull-------- me is not going to work. You had to tell me something that I believe that'd work. He had that knack."
Kepner's book lacks a compelling narrative and well-developed characters. His descriptions of how to throw various pitches can be hard to visualize; detailed illustrations would have helped. Accordingly, this volume will appeal more to hardcore fans than to casual readers, but for us baseball believers, there are plenty of nourishing nuggets here, starting with the essential nature of the pitching profession.
It's different from any position on the diamond, from any position in any sport except perhaps for a football quarterback. "The pitcher is the planner, the initiator of action," Kepner writes. Jamie Moyer, who pitched for 25 seasons, adds: "It's about being in control - who's in control of the game?" That's why mindsets are as important as muscles. And why it often takes even the best big leaguers many years to mature. Koufax won only 36 games during his first six years in the majors, from age 19 through 24; over the next six, he won 129 games (and then retired with a sore arm).
Mike Mussina, who was recently elected to the Hall of Fame, explained what every pitcher must consider before every pitch: "Who's hitting? Is he hot or cold? Where are the base runners? What's the situation? Where are we in the game? Are we on the road? Are we at home? Is it nighttime? Is it daytime? What has he done the other two at-bats? Let's say it's the seventh inning. Where's he at in the box? How'd he look taking that pitch, or how'd he look fouling that pitch off? There's all these things going on in your head."
Sure, physical attributes matter. Carl Hubbell, a nine-time All Star, always said he could throw a screwball because his left arm "hangs from my shoulder strangely." Pedro Martinez of the Boston Red Sox had "ridiculously long" fingers, according to his teammate Curt Schilling. "That's one of the reasons why he had such a good change-up. Bigger fingers allow you more control over the baseball."
But pure athleticism is not enough. The essence of great pitching is deceit. Every successful practitioner is "part magician." The key to success is not bludgeoning hitters, it's bamboozling them. Orel Hershiser, who played for 18 years before becoming a TV commentator, quotes an adage from Hall of Famer Greg Maddux: "Make strikes look like balls and make balls look like strikes." He adds: "That's pitching."
Not so much lately however. Teams are stocking their rosters with power arms that can throw 100 miles per hour, and they want them to go full speed in very short bursts - like hockey players on a shift. "These guys know only one thing, because organizations are telling them one thing: give me everything you have and we'll take care of the rest," says John Smoltz, Maddux's teammate on the Atlanta Braves and now a broadcaster. "It is not a healthy trend," Kepner writes. It leads to more pitching changes, more strikeouts, longer games and more fan discontent. (Total attendance at big league ballparks dropped by 3 million last season.)
In response, baseball recently announced that it would experiment with changes at the minor league level this season to speed up the action: requiring each pitcher to face at least three batters, for example, and moving the mound back two feet. Good ideas. Baseball needs some freshening up, but the essence of the game has remained the same since the major leagues formed in the late 19th century. The magician on the mound is in control. And he passes on the secrets of his sect, expert to acolyte, season after season.

Did you spot a UFO? U.S. Navy offers guidelines to make it easier for you to report UFO sightings

Texto completo: If the truth is out there, the Navy apparently wants to know.
A “number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space” in recent years has prompted the service to update and formalize the process to report suspected incursions.
Can you say UFOs?
A Navy statement on the effort doesn’t mention “unidentified flying objects,” or what are now called “unexplained aerial phenomena.” But Politico, which first reported the new measure, said the previously unannounced move comes in response to a string of incidents involving unidentified highly advanced aircraft being spotted by Navy strike groups and near sensitive facilities.
A 2004 case in which Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet pilots took video and expressed shock at odd-looking and acting aircraft off the coast of San Diego is one of the better known.
“For safety and security concerns, the Navy and the (Air Force) take these reports very seriously and investigate each and every report,” Joseph Gradisher, a spokesman for the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare, said in the statement describing the new reporting effort.
A message to the fleet will detail the steps for reporting each incident, Gradisher said. In response to requests for information from congressional members and staff, “Navy officials have provided a series of briefings by senior Naval intelligence officials as well as aviators who reported hazards to aviation safety,” he said.
The step is just one in a long line of government examinations of unexplained aerial phenomena, which include support in one case from former U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, who died in late 2012.
Politico and The New York Times in 2017 revealed the decadelong existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which was pushed by U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, with the help of Inouye, also a Democrat, and U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican.
The program investigated reports of UFOs, the Times said, but this past January it was revealed the effort had a broader scope.
The Defense Intelligence Agency said in congressional correspondence released through the federal Freedom of Information Act that the purpose of the program was to “investigate foreign advanced aerospace weapons threats.”
Studies looked at futuristic technologies such as invisibility cloaking, traversable wormholes, warp drive, dark energy and the manipulation of extra dimensions.
The Defense Department previously released 2004 cockpit footage from an F/A-18 Super Hornet from a case in which multiple pilots witnessed a strange oval aircraft at 25,000 feet that at one point rotated and seemed to defy normal flight physics.
One of the pilots from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz remarked over radio that it was a drone.
But then a second pilot states, “There is a whole fleet of them.” At one point, a pilot states “Look at that thing. It’s rotating!”
Defense contractor Raytheon in 2017 took a little credit for the imagery, saying it was captured by its advanced targeting forward-look infrared sensor mounted under one of the jets.
“We might be the system that caught the first evidence of E.T. out there,” Aaron Maestas, a Raytheon chief engineer, said in a release. “But I’m not surprised we were able to see it. ATFLIR is designed to operate on targets that are traveling in excess of Mach 1. It’s a very agile optical system with a sensitive detector.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump started a recent morning with a pair of angry tweets at The New York Times, demanding that his hometown paper "get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness" over its coverage of the Russia probe. "They are truly the Enemy of the People!" he wrote in his latest withering attack on the free press.
But by midday, the president was hobnobbing in the Oval Office with a group of White House news photographers, signing their photos of him and joking that they should hold a fundraiser at his golf course. Trump kept some of the prints and returned others with such praise as "Fantastic Job!" and "Amazing Talent!" in his distinctive handwriting. He chatted with Doug Mills, The Times' lead White House photographer.
The president's participation, for the third year in a row, in a private reception to celebrate the winners of the White House News Photographers Association's annual awards reflected a sharp dichotomy in how the former reality television star views the pack of correspondents that covers his every public move.
Although Trump has waged rhetorical war on newspaper writers and cable television correspondents, he has been more appreciative of the photographers who produce two-dimensional images the visually minded president has often admired.
Trump has been so taken with photos of himself published in newspapers that aides have requested high-quality prints on his behalf, and the president has retweeted images from photojournalists on social media.
"It seems like he does appreciate the photographers when we go in there," said WHNPA President Whitney Shefte, a Washington Post multimedia journalist who, along with Post photographer Jabin Botsford, were among those honored at the reception. "Last year, he said something like, 'You do great work.' It's a very different message than what he says publicly."
The WHNPA has been meeting with presidents since, at least, the administration of Harry Truman, who was named honorary president of the "One More Club," a moniker that referred to their insistence on constantly yelling out for another photo. The organization is independent from the White House Correspondents' Association, which hosts the annual fundraising dinner that Trump has boycotted since taking office.
WHCA President Olivier Knox, the chief Washington correspondent for SiriusXM, said past presidents, like Trump, have generally displayed a greater affinity for news photographers than writers or television pundits because they are viewed as less threatening.
While all presidents have been mindful of their image, Trump - whose private charity spent $30,000 on two portraits of him and whose golf resorts displayed a fake Time magazine cover bearing his visage - is perhaps the most hyper-attuned to the cameras.
During a luncheon at his first high-stakes summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore last summer, Trump jokingly instructed photojournalists to make the two leaders "look nice and handsome and thin."
Trump's tone is perhaps most striking in the way he has dealt with his hometown paper, The New York Times, which he has denounced as "failing" - even though the publication has thrived with more than 4 million total subscribers.
In early February, Trump jousted with the Times' publisher over the dangers posed by his hostility toward the press corps and complained that he felt entitled to "a great story" from the newspaper.
But by the end of that month, during a dinner with Kim at their second summit in Hanoi, Trump pointed at Mills, The Times photographer, and called him "one of the greatest photographers in the world."
That praise came after White House aides had attempted to bar newspaper and wire service writers from the photo op because they had shouted out questions at a prior event. The aides relented and allowed in one writer only after the photographers threatened to boycott coverage.
Some photographers have expressed a measure of satisfaction in the access they have to Trump. During Obama's tenure, the WHCA logged formal complaints over photojournalists being excluded from events that were open to official White House photographer Pete Souza, who has since published two books of his work.
Mills, a member of the WHCA board, said that Trump has offered more daily access, for longer sessions, than any president since he began covering the White House during the Reagan administration.
"For a photographer, you couldn't ask for anything better," Mills told the Lafayette (Indiana) Journal & Courier this month. Trump's official White House photographer, Shealah Craighead, has had a lower public profile than Souza.
WHNPA Vice President Jim Bourg, a photo editor at Reuters news service, also said that photographers see Trump more often than they did other presidents. But he added that access at campaign rallies has been more restrictive, and he noted that the president has declined to attend the annual WHNPA gala dinner the past two years.
The group, which also represents video journalists, has issued a critical statement over reports that the White House disseminated altered video of CNN's Jim Acosta after a contentious Trump news conference last fall, and it called on the president to temper his hostility toward the media after a BBC cameraman was assaulted by a Trump supporter at a rally in El Paso, Texas, in February.
But such criticism hasn't dissuaded Trump from asking for favors from the photographers. During a flight on Air Force One last August, a White House aide asked another New York Times photojournalist for a high-resolution print of a photo he had published of Trump boarding the presidential jet a day earlier amid a cloud of smoke from a ceremonial cannon in Fort Drum, N.Y.
The aide handed him a clipping of the newspaper on which Trump had underlined the photographer's name in black marker.

Texto completo: Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
'DANCING THE GODS' at Symphony Space (April 27, 8 p.m.; April 28, 7 p.m.). This program of classical Indian dancing offers two separate programs on back-to-back evenings. On Saturday, the Maryland-based Kalanidhi Dance presents "Rasa," a work inspired by the Sanskrit epic "Ramayana"; it embodies a range of emotions from disgust to wonderment through the South Indian Kuchipudi style. On Sunday, Sujata Mohapatra will perform in the Odissi style, accompanied by live music. The two styles, while sharing similarities, are distinguished by their music, costumes and contrasting physical emphases. Together they provide a look at two facets of classical Indian dance as interpreted by skilled artists.

CHANEL DASILVA, BOBBI JENE SMITH AND MICAELA TAYLOR at Gibney (May 2-3, 8 p.m.; through May 4). Gibney's new Emerge initiative gives up-and-coming choreographers the chance to create pieces for the Gibney Dance Company. The three artists invited this year are the Brooklyn native DaSilva, a former member of the Trey McIntyre Project; Smith, a fearless alum of the Batsheva Dance Company now making her own engagingly visceral work; and the Los Angeles-based Taylor, who fuses hip-hop and contemporary dance to often startling and surprising effect.

DIG DANCE at the 92nd Street Y (April 26, 8 p.m.; April 27, 4 and 8 p.m.). This recurring dance series travels to the Emerald Isle this week with "New Dance Ireland: Choreographers of Nowness," featuring a handful of choreographers, each of whom explore Irish identity and dance from a different angle. Participants include Jean Butler, Darrah Carr, Sean Curran and John Scott, among others, who are mixed and matched over three programs. For this week's installment of Fridays at Noon, Scott also curates excerpts from many of these choreographers alongside a panel discussion moderated by Siobhan Burke, a dance critic for The New York Times.

E-MOVES at Harlem Stage (May 2-4, 7:30 p.m.; through May 11). This performance space's annual dance series celebrates its 20th anniversary with two programs on consecutive weekends focusing on the social potency of hip-hop dance. Program A is anchored by "She'sus," by the collective FLUXX. The work examines the experiences of black women and appears with a piece by Joseph Webb and Baredu Ahmed, as well as one by Sun Kim and Cein Lockefeller called "Funk in Love." The following weekend, Program B features two works by Ousmane Wiles, also known as Omari Mizrahi, including a new one that explores the good and bad aspects of relationships. That program is rounded out with pieces by Faustin Linyekula and Moya Michael, as well as a short work about female empowerment by the artist TweetBoogie.

JONATHAN GONZÁLEZ at Abrons Arts Center (May 2-4, 8 p.m.). Last week at MoMA PS1, González invited visitors to enter its geodesic dome, one by one, to contemplate larger societal questions of sustainable living and individual ones about identity. That work was "Lucifer Landing I," and this week, González continues the conversation at Abrons with "Lucifer Landing II," which also features a geodesic dome. In this iteration, which González calls an opera, he further explores modern blackness, public housing and human-object intersections by drawing from influences as varied as the futurist Buckminster Fuller and the activist collective CHARAS. González is the sole performer, though he is accompanied by a number of live musicians.

GRUPPO NANOU at La MaMa Theater (April 26-27, 8 p.m.; April 28, 5 p.m.). The annual La MaMa Moves! festival of contemporary dance features local and global artists hailing from China, South Korea and Norway, among other countries. This Italian troupe kicks things off with "We Want Miles, in a Silent Way," which draws inspiration from three albums by Miles Davis that span more than a decade. Here's the catch: Davis's indispensable trumpet has been removed from the scores, which the creators said in press materials allowed them to explore the "perceptive destabilization" that Davis sought. The remaining rhythms and underlying structure provide a blueprint over which the choreographers Marco Valerio Amico and Rhuena Bracci layer free-flowing moves.
212-352-3101, lamama.org
LUCY GUERIN INC. AND DANCENORTH at the Joyce Theater (April 29-May 1, 7:30 p.m.). The first of three programs that make up the Joyce's two-week Australia Festival sees two of that continent's most prominent dance makers, Lucy Guerin and Gideon Obarzanek, join forces for "Attractor," an ecstatic fusion of dance and ritual. The Indonesian music pair Senyawa contributes a pounding, propulsive score inspired by the Javanese tradition of using dance to access a trancelike state, which members of the North Queensland-based company Dancenorth achieve with manic abandon. Select audience members will be invited to take part in the freakout as well.

NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (through June 2). City Ballet begins its spring season with work by living choreographers. A program appearing in two parts, "21st Century Choreographers" includes dances by William Forsythe, Alexei Ratmansky, Matthew Neenan, Gianna Reisen and Justin Peck, the company's resident choreographer and artistic adviser. For the Spring Gala, on Thursday, Peck introduces a new piece, as does the shrewd and much-in-demand contemporary choreographer Pam Tanowitz -- her first for City Ballet. Their works are paired with a Balanchine classic, and those looking for more of him can check out "All Balanchine" on Tuesday.

SUNDAYS ON BROADWAY at Weis Acres (April 28, 6 p.m.). It's been five years since Cathy Weis started this intimate series of one-night-only performances, readings and discussions in her downtown loft, bringing together veterans and newer voices. This season begins with the return of Eva Karczag and Vicky Shick, longtime colleagues who danced together in Trisha Brown's company and here revisit a previous collaboration called "Your Blue Is My Purple." Weis herself presents "Jury Duty." The work pairs storytelling with a projected live feed of her dancing from different angles, which adds compelling visual layers to her words.

'WORKS AND PROCESS: REID BARTELME AND HARRIET JUNG' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (April 28-29, 7:30 p.m.). The exhibition "Hymn to Apollo: The Ancient World and the Ballets Russes," which opened at N.Y.U.'s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) in March, connects the dots between antiquity and Sergei Diaghilev's famed 20th-century modernist ballet troupe. At this iteration of the Guggenheim's show-and-tell series, in partnership with ISAW, the prolific costume design team of Bartelme and Jung takes inspiration from that exhibition and applies it to designs for two commissioned works by the choreographers Netta Yerushalmy and Christopher Williams. Both use the story of "Daphnis and Chloe" as their point of departure -- one literal and one abstract. Bartelme and Jung also perform.

Area Native Slings Jokes for John Oliver
EVERY WRITER HAS had a tough editor at some point in their career; if they're lucky, they've probably gotten an angry letter or two from an aggrieved reader.
Juli Weiner is unique, perhaps, in that the most publicly aggrieved reader of her career happens to be the president of the United States. In 2011, then-private citizen Donald Trump made copious notes on a printout of Weiner's blog post lampooning his rumored 2012 presidential run, and sent the marked-up page to her Vanity Fair editor, longtime Trump foe Graydon Carter.
"Bad writer!" he wrote next to Weiner's byline.
Weiner isn't in journalism anymore, but you can still catch her writing about Trump and other figures from politics, sports and entertainment and every center of power for Last Week Tonight. The weekly talk show, which airs on Sunday nights on HBO, is hosted by British comedian and Daily Show alum John Oliver.
Weiner, an Upper Dublin High School grad who attended Congregation Beth Or growing up, doesn't particularly miss journalism (aside from "many of the people I worked with" and "their expense accounts"), but it was where she honed her skill as a writer. She wrote for the school newspaper at UDHS, as well as for a magazine at Barnard College. Before blogging for Vanity Fair, she wrote for online native outlets like Huffington Post and Wonkette, where she was also an editor.
The longer she was a journalist, the more she learned "how ill-suited I was for journalism," she said. "I learned there was an unfortunate amount of overlap between the basic requirements of the job and my personal dislikes: cold calling, participating in Q&As, bothering strangers, checking my voicemail, leaving voicemails for other people, talking on the phone - really the whole gamut of phone-based endeavors." The 2008 and 2012 presidential campaign trail, she noted, were especially trying times on that front. (Her husband, Michael Grynbaum, remains enmeshed in that world at The New York Times, where he is a reporter.)
But even in those days, comedy was never far from her mind. She used to transcribe episodes of Saturday Night Live, which "really prepared me for exactly two things: comedy writing or court stenographer." Moreover, one of her favorite publications was (and remains) Spy, which was edited by Kurt Anderson and her future Vanity Fair boss. She fell in love with the combination of "found art, gonzo stunts and research wielded like weaponry," which happen to be the same things she engages in now at Last Week Tonight.
(Some of Weiner's favorite Spy gags: "sending checks for increasingly small amounts of money to various celebrities and seeing who bothered cashing them," "publishing health code violations from popular restaurants" and "putting on an art show and seeing whether collectors could tell the difference between children's scribbles and modern art.")
Her decision to actually make the leap from journalism to writing comedy for the small screen was fairly simple.
"I'd always wanted to write for late night," she said, "and when I heard John Oliver was hiring for a new show on HBO, I applied and was hired. It's difficult to come up with a less interesting story than that."
Last Week Tonight premiered in 2014, and has produced countless segments that have earned plaudits from millions of viewers and insults from the subjects of the deeply researched screeds created by Weiner and the rest of the staff (Trump, on Last Week Tonight: "Very boring").
"The entire process is extremely collaborative, and involves many people tossing around ideas about what we want to say and how we want to say it," Weiner said. "My dayto-day experience completely depends on the day: Some days I'm in a room with nine other writers coming up with descriptions of Boris Johnson's hair; other days I'm silently looking through PDFs about the effect of zoning laws on the National Flood Insurance Program - just like I do when hanging around with my friends."
In the meantime, she's learned how to spell the name of various European strongmen, save for Poland's Jarosław Kaczyńsk, and that, horror of horrors, "HBO employees do not get free HBO."
Weiner is proud of the work she's done at Last Week Tonight, now in its sixth season, though she's still working to top her favorite joke made on the show - Russell Crowe responding to Oliver's purchase of his jockstrap from Cinderella Man by using the proceeds to build the John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward.
She makes it home to Philadelphia when she can, where her father still works as a breast cancer surgeon.
"It must be pretty exciting for him to have a daughter whose job is so much more important and high-stakes," she joked.
A New Yorker since college, the chance to visit a suburban supermarket like Wegman's remains a real treat as well, especially when Wegman's Diet Strawberry Lemonade Sparkling Soda is in season.
"If I may address Wegman's directly for a moment," she said, "there's no wrong time to enjoy Diet Strawberry Lemonade Sparking Soda." *

Why liberals want to reclaim ‘radical chic,’ and why they shouldn’t

Texto completo: Move over, #Resistance merchandise. There's a new or, rather, resurrected style in town.

In 1970, journalist Tom Wolfe coined the term “radical chic” to mock New York’s upper-class obsession with the Black Panthers. The group was militant, and its fans were posh. Elite liberals wanted to support the black power cause in a way that fit their own image, in a way that was fashionable. Thus began radical chic.

Wolfe meant to use “radical chic” as a disparaging term, to lampoon white liberals like composer Leonard Bernstein, who threw an oddly bourgeois party for members of the Black Panthers in New York’s Upper East Side.

Now some people want to reclaim the phrase, and one historian found its path to redemption in the brutal revolutionary Fidel Castro.

Last week, the New York Times credited Castro with the genesis of radical chic, calling the Cuban communist “a young celebrity” who descended on New York City in 1959 “like Sinatra headlining in Vegas.” Historian Tony Perrottet wrote that “it was a milestone in the history of fashion.”

Citing fashion historian Sonya Abrego, Perrottet argued that “radical chic” was developed years before Wolfe named it. The movement began with Castro, and the Black Panthers borrowed its style from the Cubans. But radical chic, the historians argue, isn’t a pejorative.

“‘Radical chic’ is a term that seems so 20th century,” Abrego said. “It was once very negative, referring to a style that developed organically, but has been appropriated as a fashionable look without any further political commentary or personal risk.”

A German professor of art studies, Johan Frederik Hartle, made a similar claim in a quarterly cultural journal. In “Radical Chic? Yes We Are!” he argued that the term is inoffensive because politics should be paired with aesthetics. Hartle quoted literary theorist Kenneth Burke: “Even the most practical revolutionaries will be found to have manifested their ideas in the aesthetic sphere.”

Sure, Fidel Castro and the Black Panthers are allowed to pair fashion with politics. But that doesn’t make their ideas any better. Castro may have worn fun hats and an unruly beard, but he also ruthlessly shot and imprisoned his political opposition and held his once-prosperous country back so that today it is decades behind its neighbors. It should horrify the radical chic-sters that he imprisoned and shot thousands of LGBT people, while heading up a repressive regime that still exports its brand of oppression to Venezuela to this day.

The Black Panthers copied the Cubans’ berets and popularized the Afro and the black leather jacket in a way that celebrities such as Beyoncé still copy today. The trend-setting group, which some characterize as more violent in spirit than in action, was nevertheless characterized by police-aimed and intraparty violence.

Why would people in the 21st century want to celebrate the aesthetics of an anti-progressive leader and a militant group that copied his style? Probably for the same failing Wolfe called out in “Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny’s.”

“Radical Chic, after all, is only radical in style,” Wolfe wrote. “In its heart, it is part of Society and its traditions.”

Texto completo: Amid all the debate over whether the Mueller report incriminates or exonerates President Donald Trump, one salient point is being largely overlooked: Russia interfered in the 2016 election to undermine American democracy as a whole. And the damaging effects go beyond any one party or candidate. 
The intent of Russian meddling was to sow discord in the U.S. political system, said special counsel Robert Mueller in his report to the U.S. Justice Department. The intelligence community and others say that the Kremlin will likely launch more sophisticated attacks in 2020 – both cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns on social media.
“I guarantee you that Russia is working on hacking this election right now,” says Seth Moulton, a decorated Marine and Democratic congressman from Massachusetts who entered the presidential race this week on promises to bolster national security and restore America’s moral authority in the world.
“And the fact that we are just letting them undermine our democracy, undermine the very fundamental principle that every vote counts in a democracy, is complete dereliction of duty by the commander in chief of the United States,” says Representative Moulton, responding to a question amid campaigning in Bedford, New Hampshire, on Wednesday.
Nearly half the nation’s states were targeted by Russian hacking in 2016, and the Mueller report revealed that at least one county government in Florida was breached by it. It also revealed that Russians compromised the computer network of Illinois’ Board of Elections and gained access to information about millions of voters there.
Florida is of particular concern as a key swing state and one which has faced numerous crises in its election system going back to the “hanging chad” controversy in the 2000 race between George W. Bush and Al Gore.
And it makes an important case study for other reasons. Its efforts since 2016 to step up election security and improve its cyber defenses illustrate both the scope of the challenge and possible paths to address it.
“We definitely here in the state of Florida have been and will continue to make this issue one of the most important issues moving forward,” says David Stafford, supervisor of elections for Escambia County and one of nine local election officials on the national Government Coordinating Council (GCC) for election infrastructure.
How Florida has stepped up security One thing the Trump administration has done, with the help of the GCC, is establish the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), which monitors election security threats.
Paul Lux, president of the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections, says the state was one of the first to get all local election offices to join EI-ISAC or a related national information sharing network, MS-ISAC, which alert election officials to new and ongoing threats.
In addition, 66 of 67 Florida counties have installed ALBERT sensors, which help detect malicious activity in their networks (the final county is in process).
Congress, for its part, last March approved $380 million to be disbursed to states for election security.
Florida’s then-Gov. Rick Scott directed the state to spend all $19.2 million of its allocation on shoring up its 2018 election. That covered everything from physical fences to digital defenses, including hiring five roving cybersecurity specialists.
The state has also worked with the federal Election Assistance Commission to provide cybersecurity training to state and local officials. They learned tips like, “Passwords are like underwear … change them frequently and don’t share them with anybody.”
The University of West Florida’s Center for Cybersecurity provided additional training, including live simulations in their Florida Cyber Range. The range provides a virtual environment in which attacks can be launched, giving election officials and IT workers an opportunity to learn how to identify such attacks and respond to them in a highly realistic scenario.
“Cybersecurity needs to be everybody’s business, from the elections supervisor to the volunteer,” says Eman El-Sheikh, a computer scientist who directs the university’s center. “You’re only as secure as your weakest link.”
Despite all this, a February 2018 report by the Center for American Progress gave Florida an “F” for its election security.
The think tank made that assessment based on incomplete information because the Department of State declined to participate, but lead author Danielle Root says that even with all requested information, the highest rating Florida could have received would have been a “D.” Department of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell counters that the department could not provide the information under state law, and that the report is misleading as a result. “It’s ironic that because we kept protected information secure, we earned a failing grade,” she writes in an email.
Mueller report: At least one county office breached Florida has 67 county election offices, which service anywhere from 10,000 to 1.4 million voters with staffs ranging from one or two people up to 50 to 70 employees.
The Mueller report, on page 51, says that according to an FBI investigation, Russia sent spear-phishing emails to 120 Florida county election officials. The FBI concluded that Russia was able to “gain access to the network of at least one Florida county government.”
Then-Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, warned last summer that multiple counties had been breached.
The Mueller report provided the first confirmation from a federal entity that Russians gained access to a Florida county government.
In response, Florida’s Department of State said it was not notified of any such breach, including by any of the 67 counties, and that the FBI had declined to provide further information.
“The Florida Voter Registration System was and remains secure, and official results or vote tallies were not changed,” the department said in a statement.
There is no evidence that Russian interference affected actual ballots or vote tallies.
Mr. Stafford says even if the FBI hasn’t divulged details of any attack, information from such threats is likely being incorporated in the ALBERT monitors and the alerts going out through EI-ISAC.
In addition, Mr. Lux says there’s an important distinction between a system being accessed and being compromised. He compares access to someone who sneaks into the lobby of a New York City apartment building behind someone who has a key.
“You don’t have the key to operate the elevator, you don’t have the key to open any of the doors, you’re just kind of sitting in the lobby and you’re not doing anything,” he says. “That’s the difference between being accessed and compromised.”
The road ahead Mr. Trump has played down claims of Russian interference, apparently equating the issue with attempts to delegitimize his election. According to The New York Times, recently ousted Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen was repeatedly thwarted in her efforts to develop a more comprehensive and robust plan to protect the 2020 elections – a point Representative Moulton echoed on the campaign trail.
“He’s more concerned about his own personal reputational security than the security of the United States of America,” said the congressman.
Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, says he is concerned that Russia’s success in 2016 will not only encourage them to try again – but could open a Pandora’s box of interference from multiple actors.
“Up to 2016, whether it was said publicly or not, there was a feeling among some that nobody would attempt to meddle in our elections because we’re the United States, we’re the world’s superpower, and to do something like that would risk a tremendous pushback with real repercussions,” he says.
“Now that it’s happened and there weren’t such repercussions, I do fear that others will say, ‘Well, we want to get in this game, too.’”
Ms. El-Sheikh, the computer scientist and head of UWF’s Center for Cybersecurity, says the key is not preventing all attacks but being prepared to respond to them.
“There are always going to be threats, and the threat landscape continues to evolve. Every attack is more complex than the one we’ve seen before,” she says. “The solution isn’t in trying to reach 100% security. The solution is to create more awareness, education, and training … so that we try to prevent damage from attacks to the extent that’s possible.”

En este caso, tendrán que arrodillarse y pedir perdón, ¡son verdaderamente el Enemigo del Pueblo! ”, escribió el mandatario Donald Trump el martes en Twitter.

La columna criticaba a Trump y los resultados de la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la supuesta injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016 , afirmando que el mandatario estaba consciente de la intervención en su campaña por parte de una “potencia extranjera hostil” y, una vez en el cargo, trató de obstruir cualquier investigación sobre ese hecho.
“Paul Krugman, de Fake News New York Times, ha perdido toda credibilidad, al igual que el mismo Times, con sus escritos falsos y altamente inexactos sobre mí.

I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!

CBS Will Keep Interim Chief At the Helm Through 2019

Texto completo: CBS has called off the search for a new chief executive and extended the contract of its interim chief, Joseph Ianniello, through the end of the year, the company announced on Tuesday.
CBS had been on the hunt for a permanent chief executive since September, when Leslie Moonves was ousted from the job after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations.
Mr. Ianniello, formerly the chief operating officer at CBS, became the acting chief executive upon Mr. Moonves's departure. The company hired a search firm, Korn Ferry, to find other candidates, but after six months it hadn't turned up a permanent successor.
A provision in Mr. Ianniello's contract would have allowed him to leave the company by June 30 if CBS did not intend to give him the top job. Rather than risk losing its acting chief, the CBS Corporation's board of directors extended his deal, citing his strong record.
"Joe has demonstrated exceptional leadership during this time of unprecedented transition at CBS," the board said in a statement. "He steadied the ship with some key appointments and a commitment to cultural change, and steered it forward by focusing CBS' operations around its growing direct-to-consumer strategy."
The move brings some stability to CBS roughly a year after its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, sought to merge it with its sibling company, Viacom. Both are part of the Redstone family business, National Amusements.
Before the allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Moonves became public last year, CBS sued to block the possible merger. The suit was dissolved at the time of Mr. Moonves's exit, and an agreement between him and the CBS board included a two-year delay of any merger push by Ms. Redstone.
Under the agreement, however, the CBS board may examine any possible transaction, including a Viacom merger, independent of Ms. Redstone, who is the nonexecutive vice chairwoman of the board of directors at both Viacom and CBS.
CBS has been trying to clean up its reputation both on Wall Street and in Hollywood. Two law firms were brought in to investigative the company's culture in the wake of the allegations against Mr. Moonves and the network's news division, which were revealed in two articles last year in The New Yorker. Many of the investigation's findings were published in The New York Times.
Mr. Ianniello has made key appointments since he took the interim job, including appointing David Nevins as the chief content officer of the company and Susan Zirinsky as the head of its news division.

Texto completo: Sometimes, New Mexico can't help but snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.
Three years ago, New Mexico won a national competition to bring Facebook to our state. Facebook agreed to build its new data center in Los Lunas, and in exchange, New Mexico promised the company that the state would upgrade its electric grid to power the complex with 100 percent renewable energy.
The agreement was a victory for everyone involved, especially New Mexico. Facebook would get the best deal possible for its new data center and invest $1 billion in the project. New Mexico would gain millions in tax revenue from the economic activity spun-off from the data center. And everyone would benefit from upgraded transmission infrastructure that would bring more renewable energy online.
Facebook delivered on its side of the deal and more. In 2017, it announced it was tripling the size of the complex, creating hundreds of long-term jobs for New Mexicans and spurring an economic boom in Valencia County.
But being New Mexico, state regulators couldn't let a good thing go untouched. Last week, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (PRC) voted 5-0 to force Facebook to pay half the costs for a transmission line to its new data center in Los Lunas. These costs were not part of Facebook's original agreement with the state to build the facility. The future of the entire project is now in jeopardy thanks to the PRC's "gotcha" decision.
Within days of the PRC's action, many national news organizations, including the New York Times, ran headlines declaring "New Mexico Panel Blindsides Facebook with $39M Utility Bill."
While I am hopeful that the parties involved will eventually resolve this dispute, it will be too late to take back the negative headlines. The damage is done. Companies and investors across the country have now been warned: New Mexico writes its contracts with erasable ink.
Of course, the blame game began well in advance of the PRC's vote. Both the PRC and the state's largest utility company, PNM, pointed fingers at each other. The reality is that the PRC and PNM have long maintained an adversarial relationship, and now Facebook is caught in the crossfire.
Regardless of the who-what-when-and whys of this decision, the ugliness of the ongoing feud between the PRC and PNM has unavoidably compromised New Mexico's future ability to attract more big projects to the state. What business will want to make a deal with state negotiators knowing that they could be sent a surprise $39 million bill afterward?
If New Mexico is to realize its vision of creating a vibrant economy and good opportunities for our workers, we must rise above these petty squabbles about regulatory technicalities and focus on our larger goals.
Do we want to be a player in the information economy? Do we want to be a leader in increasing renewable energy use? Do we want to create new careers for us and our children?
If the answer is yes, then let's work together to make it happen. But we'll never achieve our dreams if we keep repeating the same self-sabotaging actions that have kept us in the economic cellar for decades.
When Facebook announced it was tripling the size of its data center, a local carpenter who had been unemployed for six months before being hired to work on the Facebook project, said, "Facebook has been my oasis in the desert. I was questioning my future in New Mexico."
Now it's Facebook's turn to question its future in New Mexico. The PRC's inflexible attitude in this case misses the forest for the trees. The reputational damage from their action is now part of our state's brand. This is why New Mexico can't have nice things.

Reporter: Sanders's testimony 'a big deal'

Texto completo: Trump's press secretary was already viewed with skepticism by media
Reporters have long approached White House press secretary Sarah Sanders with a trust-but-verify attitude, knowing full well that Sanders is tasked with spinning some of the more unspinnable statements made by her boss, President Trump.
But with the publication of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's report on Thursday, Sanders's credibility among the people who cover her has been stretched about as taut as a violin string.
One White House reporter, April Ryan, has openly called for Sanders to be fired. While others don't go that far, they acknowledge that Sanders's public statements have damaged her, perhaps permanently, as the president's spokeswoman. In conversations with reporters, it's not unusual to hear her compared unfavorably to Ron Ziegler, President Nixon's press secretary, whose reputation was shredded by the Watergate scandal.
Sanders admitted under oath to Mueller's investigators that she made false statements to the press after Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey in May 2017. Sanders told Mueller that her comment that "countless" FBI employees had told her they supported the president's decision was "a slip of the tongue." She also said a second utterance - in which she said that Trump and "the rest of the FBI" had lost confidence in Comey - was made "in the heat of the moment." Mueller's report concluded that her comments were "not founded on anything."
Given that she made the erroneous statements on two separate occasions, her explanations for them raised the possibility that she not only lied, but lied in explaining why she lied.
"I hope and trust that she understands why this is a big deal and why it matters to us and to her," said Peter Baker, the veteran New York Times White House reporter, in an interview Monday. "A press secretary's most important asset is credibility. If you don't have that, there's not much point. But we all make mistakes. The test is what you do about it to make things better."
Sanders hasn't offered an apology or a public correction. Instead, she has gone on offense. After repeating the "heat of the moment" excuse during an interview on "Good Morning America," she fired back, "I'm sorry that I wasn't a robot like the Democrat Party that went out for 2 1/2 years and repeated time and time again that there was definitely Russian collusion between the president and his campaign."
Ryan, a CNN political analyst who covers the White House for American Urban Radio Networks, was having none of that on Monday. "She has acknowledged that she lied under oath," she said. "You can't trust her. End of story."
She added, "She's been caught in lie after lie. It's beyond spin. She speaks for the president, so it's life and death. In any other job, if someone acknowledged they lied under oath, they'd be gone. They'd be terminated."
After Ryan called for Trump to "start lopping the heads off" of discredited officials, including Sanders, Sanders's father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, called the comment "an incitement to murder" on Twitter. He asked if the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) would revoke Ryan's press credential, apparently unaware that the WHCA doesn't issue press credentials. Sanders told "Fox & Friends" that the comment was "a new low for the liberal media."
To some extent, Sanders's credibility is a moot point among reporters, given her increasing isolation from and limited contacts with the press.
Under Sander's tenure, formal press briefings have all but disappeared, relieving Sanders of what was, at least in previous administrations, the press secretary's primary daily responsibility. As of Tuesday, the Trump White House will set a record for the longest stretch without a briefing, 43 days. This breaks the previous record set in March (42 days), which broke the record set in January (41 days). Since the beginning of the year, Sanders has had just two briefings, fielding press questions for a mere 30 minutes or so in total.
Sanders sometimes holds Q&As with reporters on the White House driveway outside the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room. But these are both informal and irregular. She has also become well known among reporters for not responding to emails or calls to her office seeking comment.
Sanders did not reply to a request for comment for this story.
One reporter points out that Sanders can be helpful in the limited times she does engage, but not in a way that the public - or the president - sees. Sanders still has access to the president and can be a useful source on background or off the record, said the reporter. "She won't deny things that she knows to be true," said the reporter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because her employer hadn't approved her speaking for publication.
"As far as I'm concerned, the Mueller report hasn't changed anything," said Olivia Nuzzi, who covers the White House for New York magazine. "Sanders never should have been relied on, and she should not be relied on now."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Addressing reporters from the White House lectern, press secretary Sarah Sanders made a startling claim shortly after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey two years ago.
"I've heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the president's decision," she said, refusing to back down when pressed on the issue. "Between emails, text messages, absolutely," she insisted.
It wasn't true.
She later told prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller that her comments were a "slip of the tongue."
It's a crime to lie to federal investigators or Congress, a lesson that many of Trump's associates found out the hard way. But it's not a crime to lie to reporters and the American people.
The redacted, 448-page Mueller report released Thursday exposed in voluminous detail how the Trump White House is comfortable not only spinning the truth, but outright demolishing it.
Sometimes the president did the lying himself. Sometimes he had others tell lies for him. And sometimes people just lied because they thought it was required of them.
After the president fired Comey, the White House issued a statement saying that Trump had acted on a recommendation from the Justice Department. But Trump had previously decided to sack Comey, and Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, told investigators he believed the president personally dictated the misleading statement.
Days later, when Mueller was appointed special counsel, White House officials told reporters that Trump was undisturbed by the development.
In fact, he was devastated.
"This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency," he said, according to notes taken by an aide.
Trump sometimes lied to his own aides. One episode involved a resignation letter prepared by Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, who had infuriated Trump by recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation.
The president decided not to push out Sessions at the time, but he brought the letter with him on a trip to the Middle East, showing it to senior advisers aboard Air Force One.
Priebus was concerned that the president planned to use the letter as leverage over Sessions, and he asked about it during the trip. Trump falsely said the document was back in his White House residence.
Later that year, Trump tried to prevent the truth from coming out about a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-connected lawyer and senior campaign officials.
Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, recalled telling Trump that emails setting up the meeting looked "really bad."
The messages showed that the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was told the lawyer was working on behalf of the Russian government and would bring damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Then Trump Jr. had emailed back, "If it's what you say I love it."
The president "directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails," the report said.
When the meeting was revealed by The New York Times on July 8, 2017, Trump edited a public statement to conceal crucial details. He removed a line admitting the meeting involved someone who "might have information helpful to the campaign," and he emphasized that participants talked about the adoption of Russian children. The statement was issued under Trump Jr.'s name.
The embarrassing emails soon leaked, contradicting the statement dictated by the president, but the lies continued.
"Over the next several days, the president's personal counsel repeatedly and inaccurately denied that the president played any role in drafting Trump Jr.'s statement," the report said.
Once the president's role was revealed, he downplayed the importance of being honest with the public. "It's a statement to The New York Times. That's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges," Trump told reporters.
The report makes clear that Trump leads a White House where falsehoods and misrepresentations are common practice.
Sanders tried to do damage control on her credibility Friday, insisting that her comments after Comey's firing were made in the "heat of the moment" and that she hadn't intentionally misled the American public.
"I said that it was in the heat of the moment, meaning it wasn't a scripted thing," she said on "CBS This Morning." "But the big takeaway here is that the sentiment is 100% accurate."

Texto completo: CBS airs a concert celebrating Motown Records. And catch "Book Club," with Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, Diane Keaton and Mary Steenburgen, on Hulu.
What's on TV
MOTOWN 60: A GRAMMY CELEBRATION 8 p.m. on CBS. In a 1972 interview with The New York Times, Diana Ross offered this assessment of her early years with the Supremes: "I was surprised how good I was too." Ross, one of the most successful performers associated with Motown Records, was among the performers at this tribute concert in February, held to recognize the 60th anniversary of the label's founding. Hosted by Cedric the Entertainer and Ross's fellow Motown singer Smokey Robinson, the concert's lineup mixes Motown voices with musicians influenced by the label. John Legend, Boyz II Men and Meghan Trainor are among them. Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown Records, also speaks.
KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 (2003) 12 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on BBC America. When the lineup of films that will compete for the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival next month was unveiled Thursday, one director was half in, half out: Quentin Tarantino. The director's newest movie, "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood," could join the lineup -- but only if it's completed in time. (It's slated for release July 26.) In the meantime, Uma Thurman will be slicing her way to revenge in Tarantino's "Kill Bill: Volume 1" and KILL BILL: VOLUME 2 (2004). That second part is airing at 2:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. on BBC America. Both volumes of this revenge tale follow Thurman's "the Bride," a character who wipes the floor with most anybody who stands in her way as she navigates the stylish obstacle course of B-movie references Tarantino places between her and Bill (David Carradine), who once betrayed her. Those who like their Tarantino with a stronger taste of spaghetti western can opt instead for DJANGO UNCHAINED (2012), airing at 2:15 p.m. on TNT.
JACK REACHER (2012) 5 p.m. on FX. "The emptier I made Reacher," the author Lee Child once told The Times, "The more of a mirror he became. The reader has a chance to partly create the character himself." But audiences of the movie don't need to do much creating: Tom Cruise does it for them. Cruise plays Reacher here, moving through a story that involves a Pittsburgh murder spree, a mysterious criminal (Werner Herzog) and a lot of punching.
What's Streaming
BOOK CLUB (2018) Stream on Hulu. Fonda, Bergen, Keaton and Steenburgen star as book club confidants in this light comedy, which is filled with chardonnay and unexpected romance. Their discussions about a risqué book (it's "Fifty Shades of Grey") turn into discussions about their own sex lives, inspiring each to reassess their different situations. At its core, the movie serves as an excuse to spend time in the company of its four star leads. "Each one," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, "Brings enough credibility and charisma to 'Book Club' to render its weaknesses largely irrelevant."

Women Don't Get Comebacks Like Tiger

Texto completo: Last Sunday, when Tiger Woods won the Masters after his long drought, it was more than just one of the most incredible comebacks in history. It showed America's eagerness to embrace a man who persevered through years of setbacks, especially self-inflicted ones, regardless of whatever selective amnesia that requires.
America does love a comeback: Achievement in sports somehow makes us more willing to compartmentalize, to forgive transgressions, to make a complicated man more deserving of public redemption. And Woods, at age 43, needed a lot of redeeming. His fall from grace started in 2009 when his wife caught him cheating with multiple women and continued through 2017 when he pleaded guilty to reckless driving.
As he plotted his comeback, Woods has emerged as a unique figure -- both President Barack Obama and President Trump applauded him. Mr. Trump will even award him a medal. This ability to charm so many different Americans has almost certainly aided his return to grace, while also alienating a large swath of society that sees him as inauthentic.
Why aren't there more redemption stories like this among women? It's not just because women aren't given second chances. It's because they are rarely able to reach those heights in the first place.
Many high-achieving people, regardless of gender, have an Icarus complex. The extreme qualities and the obsessive pursuit of success that drive their ascents can lead to their downfall. The discipline and pressure can lead to addictions, the opposite of control. Obviously we saw that in Woods; following his descent grew excruciating. But it fit the narrative.
Woods understood this. Entering rehab in 2010 after accusations of infidelity, sex addiction and substance abuse, he said: "I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled."
In men, excessive qualities can be forgiven, even admired -- when it works out at least. His trajectory is a reminder of who pays forever for their mistakes and whose transgressions can be set aside.
Part of the problem is that so few women even reach the athletic heights of Woods, let alone stay there. Yes, we have the extraordinary Serena Williams. But can you name another female athlete on the financial and cultural level as Tiger Woods, LeBron James, Tom Brady and their peers?
Of the few iconic women, sponsors and fans, to a certain degree, want them to be perfect -- or at least quiet. Women's moral behavior deeply influences our perception of their professional achievements.
Consider how swiftly the Olympic runner and nine-time N.C.A.A. champion Suzy Favor Hamilton was vilified after she was caught working as an escort while coping with mental illness. Nike immediately severed ties, as did many other groups associated with her. The athletic achievements on her Wikipedia page became subsumed by stories of prostitution.
"It was as if I must have murdered someone," Favor Hamilton said recently. "Never a degree of 'Well, perhaps something must be very much wrong."'
For Hamilton, the attraction to vice fulfilled the same thing many elite athletes get from the rush of victory in sport. "It was the buzz I felt as an athlete," she said. "I have a history of taking things to extremes."
Most champions do.
Oksana Baiul won an Olympic gold medal in figure skating for her native Ukraine in 1994, and moved to Connecticut with millions of dollars, after having slept alone in an ice rink as an impoverished orphan. A few years later, she had been charged with a D.U.I. and gone through rehab for alcohol abuse. "She appears serious about trying to turn her life around and returning to respectability," The Times reported in 1998, noting the 17 pounds she'd lost since the previous winter, "when she was drinking and overweight and barely able to land any jump."
Spoiler: She didn't return to competitive skating.
Two great female athletes did have major comebacks. But the "setbacks" were totally different. Monica Seles was victimized by a maniacal fan who stabbed her on the court. And Serena Williams is in the midst of comeback -- after having a baby. Like Woods, each of these women had physical setbacks. But neither of them made mistakes.
Except Williams has surpassed her male peers and demonstrated the flip side of the extreme, confident and righteous qualities necessary to achieve success -- she dared to get angry, and show it, when she opposed what she considered an unfair call at the United States Open last September. The public immediately chastised her. There was silence, and then a lot of Instagram posts about motherhood and her daughter.
No women have the leeway to behave like Woods and get away with it; a black woman certainly does not. Just imagine the reaction if Serena Williams was caught cheating on her husband, Alexis Ohanian, with numerous men.
There are also practical ingredients of a comeback: It requires support, both popular and financial. Nike never abandoned Woods; analysts said his win generated worth more than $22 million in exposure for the company.
Women literally cannot afford to make the messy mistakes we see in the long arc of a lot of a storied male athletes' careers, and they rarely get the payoffs.
"I'm no Tiger Woods," Hamilton told me. "There is so much money at stake with someone like him. So a company like Nike will do anything to protect him and his image." She still had a relationship with Nike when reports of her escort work prompted the company to drop her. Now, she said, "I'm on an island trying to protect myself."
Society rarely allows women to nurture those bold qualities that drive standout success. Instead, to get ahead, women either learn to stifle those instincts, or get punished for them. This muffles the traits that might lead to failure and inevitably also the qualities that lead to success.
To be sure, some men are being held accountable for their bad behavior these days. And Woods faced widespread public scorn after his philandering and reckless driving. But that evaporated last weekend when he was widely celebrated, after having been encouraged to pursue his comeback.
Shouldn't everyone be able to recover from a fall from grace? Or at the very least, shouldn't we allow both men and women to get high enough to fall?

Texto completo: On the east side of Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan, three cameras on the roof of a restaurant film the lunch crowds, tourists and commuters. The feeds are streamed online for anyone to see.
Thousands walk through the park each day. It's the type of public space, like a sidewalk, road or train station, that most people pass through in their daily routine.
Generally, we think that when we walk through a park, and whom we're with when we're there, is private information -- certainly not something a stranger could have access to. But facial recognition, applied to the web of cameras that already exists in most cities, is a threat to that assumption.
To demonstrate how easy it is to track people without their knowledge, The Times collected public images of people who worked near Bryant Park (available on their employers' websites, for the most part) and ran one day of footage from the park cameras through Amazon's commercial facial-recognition service. (We've since deleted the images that we collected and are no longer monitoring the Bryant Park cameras.)
Our system made several possible identifications and matched one frame to a head shot of Richard Madonna, a professor at the SUNY College of Optometry.
"My first reaction was, 'Oh, my God, that is unbelievable,"' Dr. Madonna said after we reached him and explained the experiment. "I was shocked at how readily it seems that it picked me up, because, really -- it's the side of my head."
The cameras in Bryant Park were installed more than a decade ago so that people could see whether the lawn was open for sunbathing, for example, or check how busy the ice skating rink was in the winter, according to the corporation that runs the park.
But our experiment shows that a person equipped with just a few cameras and facial recognition technology can learn people's daily habits. This is entirely legal. In the United States, facial recognition is almost wholly unregulated.
New York City is nothing like China, where the government has installed approximately one surveillance camera for every seven citizens. But according to the American Civil Liberties Union, the police here have access to more than 9,000 camera feeds in Lower Manhattan alone. Advocates warn about the chilling effect on free speech if the government could monitor everyone's whereabouts all the time.
Hundreds of cameras across New York City monitor traffic, and the feeds are streamed publicly online. And the city's LinkNYC kiosks, which provide free wireless internet, each have two security cameras, though using facial recognition is against the policy of the company that owns the kiosks.
Amazon is one of several companies that sell facial-recognition services to the public. It has highlighted positive applications of its technology -- like the ability to help find lost children -- but has been criticized for marketing facial recognition to law-enforcement agencies.
The company recommends using a threshold of at least 99 percent similarity for applications of its service that involve public safety. None of the matches we obtained from the Bryant Park footage met that threshold.
Matt Wood, the general manager of artificial intelligence for Amazon Web Services, noted it is possible that the service, like other types of information available to law-enforcement officials, could be used inappropriately. "The law-enforcement agency will have to be accountable to these individuals and to the law if they violate people's civil liberties," he said.
So how should this technology be regulated? Some privacy advocates propose that authorities must have a reasonable suspicion before conducting a search with this technology and would prohibit, except in life-or-death situations, live facial-recognition searches using driver's license databases.
Others say the technology is so dangerous that no regulation is sufficient. But it might already be too late for a ban.
Dr. Madonna said that as a doctor, he often considers the ratio of risk to benefit. He saw the tremendous benefits that facial recognition could offer. But the technology is open to abuse, he added, when individuals or governments can use it to track any group, or just about any ordinary person -- even someone walking through Bryant Park.

Texto completo: Kate Smith's soaring rendition of "God Bless America" has been a been a cherished part of New York Yankees and Philadelphia Flyers games for years.
But it appears that sports fans will no longer get to hear Smith's popular take on that patriotic number at Yankees and Flyers games, now that those teams have reportedly said they'll stop playing Smith's "God Bless America" after finding that the singer also performed racist songs in the 1930s.
"Smith, who died in 1986, is most closely identified with God Bless America,' but recorded numerous other songs over her long career. Among them were Pickaninny Heaven' and That's Why Darkies Were Born,' which contain disturbing lyrics that demean black people," reports The New York Times.
The Yankees had reportedly been playing Smith's "God Bless America" during the seventh-inning stretch of games since 2001, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. But the Flyers' history with Smith goes back even further.
"Since 1969, the team has played Smith's God Bless America' before must-win games, where it has proven to be a good luck charm. According to the Flyers, the team went 101-31-5 in games where Smith's version of the song aired, including 3-1-0 when Smith sang the song live at the Spectrum, beginning with the Flyers' home opener in 1973 against the Toronto Maple Leafs," according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
That relationship now appears to be over. The Flyers have not only stopped playing "God Bless America," but also covered a statue of Smith outside the arena.
"We have recently become aware that several songs performed by Kate Smith contain offensive lyrics that do not reflect our values as an organization," the Flyers said in a statement, according to CBS Philly.
"As we continue to look into this serious matter, we are removing Kate Smith's recording of God Bless America' from our library and covering up the statue that stands outside of our arena."
The Yankees are apparently treating the situation like a suspension and have yet to make a final decision on whether Smith's "God Bless America" will ever be played again at the stadium.

An artist rises, and brings a generation with him

Texto completo: NEW HAVEN, Conn. - Like many town-and-gown cities, New Haven is a community of parallel narratives. There is the storied Elm City of Yale University, a place of carillon bell towers, leaded glass windows and lush quadrangles behind iron gates.
But artist Titus Kaphar wants to shift the narrative to a part of the city little known to outsiders, a once-thriving historic African-American neighborhood called Dixwell where he and his family have lived for more than a decade.
Kaphar, 42, has a profound connection to the forgotten, from the slaves owned by the Founding Fathers to the ubiquity of African-Americans in the criminal justice system, including his own father. The recipient of a recent MacArthur "genius" award, the artist is challenging racism in a body of strong work that has entered the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the Yale University Art Gallery, and was recently featured at the National Portrait Gallery. Kaphar is known for appropriating images from American and European art to subvert them, cutting them into his canvases to pull back the velvet curtain of history. He wields materials like tar, wire, gold leaf and nails to unearth the past's inconvenient truths, and to shine a restorative light on those residing in the shadows.
In Dixwell, a neighborhood buffeted by need in the shadows of Yale, he is rewriting the script with NXTHVN (for "Next Haven"), a $12 million nonprofit arts incubator and fellowship program he founded to nurture rising talents. The enterprise is housed in two once-moribund factory buildings that are being re-imagined by architect Deborah Berke, dean of the Yale School of Architecture.
He envisions the project as a beacon for graduates hellbent on getting out of Dodge for New York (Kaphar, a 2006 Yale School of Art graduate, "drank the Kool-Aid" himself). "New Haven has some of the most esteemed artists in the world," he said. "Yet as a city, we've done very little to say, 'Why don't you stay here?'"
The first half, studios for seven artist-fellows, is up and running in a former ice cream factory filled with natural light. The second building, where lab equipment was manufactured, is under renovation and NXTHVN hard hats are everywhere. The complex will unfold in phases and include a cafe run by a local nonprofit, a combined coworking and gallery space, a theater and a three-story addition with skylights and loft-like apartments for visiting artists-in-residence.
Financing for the 40,000-square-foot project has come from the state ($3 million) and the city ($1 million for facade improvements), with several million dollars from private foundations and philanthropies. Collectors of the artist's work have helped subsidize the fellowship program.
Long a cultural hub for Black residents, with a jazz club where Miles Davis and other luminaries played, the neighborhood was devastated by urban renewal and the 2006 closing of the Winchester Repeating Arms Factory up the street, which once employed 26,000 people. "I think sometimes folks feel like we, as poor people, don't know the difference," Kaphar said of bringing distinctive arts and architecture to the neighborhood. "So we'll get the leftovers - the backpack someone already discarded, the building that the city couldn't find any other use for."
The idea of an internationally competitive fellowship was inspired by Kaphar's residency at the Studio Museum in New York's Harlem, a program founded in 1968 by William T. Williams, an artist he reveres. The seven artist-fellows at NXTHVN were chosen from 166 applicants. They are being steeped in art business nitty-gritty, from negotiating with galleries to public speaking.
"The art world is full of secrets," said Vaughn Spann, who graduated in 2018 with a master's degree in fine arts from Yale. "Titus is unlocking the vault."
Talented young people from local high schools serve as paid apprentices, learning how to sand and apply gesso to panels, or edit images online.
Historically, artists have learned their craft by apprenticing with masters, Kaphar noted. "Diego Velazquez never went to graduate school," he added.
Velazquez also never gave a major TED Talk - as Kaphar has notably done, demonstrating how artists convey wealth and privilege by taking a copy of a Frans Hals portrait of a 16th-century aristocratic family and whitewashing the main figures to shift the gaze to a black servant in the background. The painting will be the subject of "One: Titus Kaphar," an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum starting June 21.
In his 2018 painting, "Seeing Through Time," perched on two paint cans at NXTHVN (it is now on view at Mass MoCA, the Berkshires museum), Kaphar layered European characters onto a canvas, then peeled them back, creating space for a black girl, dressed in velvet and pearls, to emerge alongside a powerful contemporary woman. The girl breaks through layers of paint, and with it, the patriarchal and monoracial currents in the Western canon.
"For 400 years, the little girl on the side was always there," he said of the art-historical device. "But you were never supposed to contemplate her personhood - her wants, needs and desires."
Kaphar did not discover art until his mid-20s, when he was trying to impress a young woman named Julianne, now his wife. He registered for an art survey class at a junior college in California and was outraged when the professor announced that they would be skipping over the "black people in art" section.
As a graduate student he looked hard at paintings and sculpture in the Yale University Art Gallery. Fittingly, his own work now hangs there: "Shadows of Liberty" (2016) is a portrait of George Washington in which his torso and face are obscured by nailed canvas strips, each inscribed with the names of slaves Washington owned in a given year.
In "Yet Another Fight for Remembrance" (2015), commissioned by Time magazine after Ferguson, Missouri, young black protesters, their hands raised in a don't-shoot stance, are caught in aggressive strokes of white paint, suggesting attempts to silence their voices. The humanity of their gaze is visible above the fray. The work "stops you flat," Murray Whyte wrote in The Boston Globe. "This is rough stuff, yet it's plied with seductive grace."
In many ways, NXTHVN represents Kaphar's own "seeing through time," reaching back into his own personal history to give promising young people a gift he never had. His father was in and out of prison for most of Kaphar's childhood. In Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he was born, the family earned extra cash in the neighborhood by carting metal barrels of burned trash to the dump.
For years he bounced among various family members, at one point living in a basement. At age 15, he left his father's house for good after a violent incident in which the older man hit his girlfriend so hard she flew acrcss the room and struck a mirror. Young Titus picked glass out of the woman's back - and didn't speak to his father again for 20 years.
"There is a way in which my life is a trope," he observed the other day. "'Poor Black boy from bad neighborhood becomes famous artist.' As with all tropes, it lacks specificity."
In San Jose, Calif., where his mother - who now has a master's degree in counseling - lived briefly, he connected with a stable, close-knit family, a widower and his three sons, who became an anchoring force. He wound up living with them during his high school years. Later, the man, whom Kaphar calls "my dad," Mars Severe, told him "I saw something in you."
"Senseless generosity got me here where I am," Kaphar said.
The Jerome Project, perhaps his best-known work, was inspired by glimmers of reconciliation with his estranged father, Jerome, who was remorseful when Kaphar encountered him at a family gathering. He researched his father's incarceration record online and was stunned to find "99 other men with the exact same name - all of them trapped in the criminal justice system and all of them Black," he said.

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
ART OF THE REAL at the Film Society of Lincoln Center (through April 28). Few movies in this annual showcase can be comfortably described as "documentaries" -- the goal is to broaden perceptions of what nonfiction filmmaking is and can do. Miko Revereza's "No Data Plan" (on Friday), for instance, has a hallucinatory quality: Footage of train travel across the United States is used to emphasize the paranoia felt by undocumented immigrants living in America. A major highlight of this year's edition is said to be the tribute to the Lebanese filmmaker Jocelyne Saab, who died in January. The essay films that constitute her Beirut trilogy (on April 28) reflect on life in that city in the midst of the Lebanese civil war.

DOCUMENTARY IN DIALOGUE: WERNER HERZOG at Anthology Film Archives (through April 28). It may be the case that Herzog is eventually better known for his documentaries than his fiction features; they are never simple chronicles of events, but often use a subject to ponder humanity's insignificance in the vastness of nature and the cosmos. Anthology's series pairs various Herzog films with other documentaries that highlight the eccentricities of his approach. Herzog's capital-punishment documentary, "Into the Abyss," will play back-to-back with the early-1960s documentary "The Chair," which captures events leading up to a parole hearing for the death-row inmate Paul Crump. Both movies show on Saturday and April 27, and Jill Drew, the daughter-in-law of Robert Drew, a director of "The Chair," will appear at Saturday's screening.
212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org
NELSON PEREIRA DOS SANTOS at the Metrograph (April 19-28). Credited as a founder of the Cinema Novo movement, this Brazilian director (1928-2018) and his politically pointed films are perhaps not as frequently revived in New York as they should be. The Metrograph's retrospective begins with the satire "How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman" (on Friday, Saturday and Monday), inspired by a 16th-century memoir of European colonialism, in which a Frenchman is taken in by an island of cannibals; it continues with dos Santos's debut feature, "Rio 40 Degrees" (on Friday, Sunday and Tuesday), a cross-section of life in Rio de Janeiro.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
SEE IT BIG! ACTION at the Museum of the Moving Image (April 19-July 7). The museum gets a jump on summer blockbusters with this series of much-loved pulse-pounders, which kicks off this weekend with Steven Spielberg's "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (on Friday and Saturday) and some types of movies to which it owes a debt. Spielberg has expressed his admiration for Akira Kurosawa, whose "Seven Samurai" screens on Sunday. "Anne of the Indies" (on Saturday), a highlight of winter's Tourneur retrospective at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, is a more straightforward B-level swashbuckler, with Jean Peters as a pirate (a profession dominated by men, to put it mildly) and some extremely lush Technicolor cinematography.

TRILOGIES at Film Forum (April 19-May 16). Strict continuity is optional for the movies in this collection, which have one main attribute in common: There are three of each. The "Godfather" trilogy (showing throughout April) and Satyajit Ray's Apu series (at the end of April and in May) invite audiences to follow generation-spanning sagas. Other trilogies -- Krzysztof Kieslowski's "three colors" movies (on April 30), Hou Hsiao-Hsien's youth films from "A Summer at Grandpa's" (on May 4) through "Dust in the Wind" (on May 5), John Ford's cavalry westerns (on May 8 and 11) -- have only loose thematic links. In some cases, they've become trilogies with the benefit of hindsight.

WILD THINGS: THE FEROCIOUS FILMS OF NELLY KAPLAN at the Quad Cinema (through April 25). Writing about this Argentine-French director's debut feature, "A Very Curious Girl," earlier this month, J. Hoberman described it in The New York Times as "a one-time staple of women's film festivals that never quite became a classic." The opportunity for a rediscovery continues as this Kaplan retrospective enters its second week with her later features -- most, if not all, overlooked in the United States. One is "Velvet Paws" (on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday), which stars Bernadette Lafont (the erstwhile very curious girl) as a psychic who receives a visit from a massage therapist (Caroline Sihol), seeking closure on her husband's death. They soon discover that he is not only alive, but also married to both of them.

Texto completo: The world's next hot spot theoretically could be its coldest. Atop the globe, the Arctic expanse is a new frontier for the United States and friends to fortify against an aggressive, ambitious Russia.
The West used to rely on the polar cap as a trusty, ice-covered moat to keep the Russians at bay. But climate change is slowly melting that cap. As ice sheets shrink, Russia's assertiveness in the Arctic grows. Moscow has reopened military bases in its Arctic regions that closed down when the Cold War ended, The New York Times recently reported. Russia has ramped up its fleet of icebreaker ships, and has Arctic-based anti-ship missile launchers and air defense systems at the ready.
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently said he isn't done beefing up Russia's presence in the Arctic, announcing a plan to establish new ports along the northern coastline and build more icebreakers.
So a very different "Cold War" is brewing where only polar bears, narwhals and walruses venture. It's not just a tussle over ice floes. It is believed that at least a quarter of the world's undiscovered oil and natural gas is locked underneath the Arctic Ocean. And as Arctic ice melts, those new sources of energy will be ripe for exploration, and new shipping lanes will become accessible.
Putin has known this for some time, which is why, in 2007, the Kremlin sent a couple of submersibles to the seabed underneath the North Pole to plant a titanium Russian flag and claim the Pole in the name of Mother Russia. At the time, it was derided as a stunt. Today, Russia's growing military presence in the Arctic is a concern.
Putin relishes the prospect of a dominant presence in the Arctic: a day when the region's energy wealth and strategic value are firmly in Russia's grasp.
Fortunately, the U.S. has been thinking about this. The Pentagon's strategy includes ramping up the number of fighter jets stationed in Alaska, conducting more extreme-cold training for troops and upgrading its military radar network on the Aleutian Islands. "Certainly America's got to up its game in the Arctic. There's no doubt about that," Jim Mattis told reporters in Alaska last summer when he was still Defense secretary. "The reality is that we're going to have to deal with the developing Arctic."
Mattis was right. Global warming is setting up the day when the Arctic becomes a shipping superhighway, and reveals the world's next trove of natural resources wealth. The last thing the U.S. and its allies want to see is an Arctic expanse studded with Russian flags.

Texto completo: Lies, damned lies and presidential aides' misstatements.
The Mueller report on Thursday revealed several instances when aides to President Donald Trump, while under oath, acknowledged that statements they once stood by were based on something other than facts or truth.
Take, for instance, the afternoon of May 10, 2017, when White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters that former FBI Director James Comey had been fired because he’d lost the confidence of President Trump, the Department of Justice and members of both parties in Congress. And, for good measure: “Most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in Comey. ”
Sanders went on to say that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had decided “on his own” to examine Comey’s performance and then expressed his concerns to Trump about them on May 8.
Mueller report: Trump took steps to fire Mueller, stop probe after campaign welcomed Russian dirt on Clinton, Mueller report says
The obstruction question: President Trump tried to impede Russia inquiry but aides ignored his orders
Collusion: Trump campaign was an eager beneficiary of Russian election help, Mueller report concludes
A reporter challenged Sanders, saying Comey, in fact, had enjoyed support from the vast majority of FBI agents. “Look,” Sanders chided the reporter, “we’ve heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things. "
But it was Sanders who said very different things when questioned by Mueller’s investigators about her comment.
“Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from ‘countless members of the FBI’ was a ‘slip of the tongue,’” according to the report. “She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made 'in the heat of the moment' that was not founded on anything. ”
Hours after the report was released, Sanders appeared on Fox News but did not apologize, explaining that she merely misspoke when she used the word "countless. "
"I acknowledge that I had a slip of the tongue when I used the word 'countless,' but it's not untrue," she said, adding that her point at the time was that "a number of both current and former FBI agents agreed with the president. James Comey was a disgraced leaker who tried to politicize and undermine the very agency he was supposed to run. "
The same incident found former White House spokesman Sean Spicer spreading misinformation about Comey's firing. The report determined that the decision to fire Comey had originated with Trump, who later pressed Rosenstein to own the decision.

"The President then called Rosenstein directly and said he was watching Fox News, that the coverage had been great, and that he wanted Rosenstein to do a press conference," the report says. "Rosenstein responded that this was not a good idea because if the press asked him, he would tell the truth that Corney's firing was not his idea. "
Spicer, at an impromptu news conference, picked up where Rosenstein would not tread, telling reporters: "It was all (Rosenstein). No one from the White House," the report says.
President Trump himself is shown elsewhere in the report urging top aides to issue false statements. But that didn’t always work.
Irate over a report in The New York Times that he had urged White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller, Trump directed McGahn to issue a statement denying the story. McGahn refused to do so several times, according the report.
“The President nevertheless persisted and asked McGahn to repudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were accurate,” according to the report.
In the end, McGahn held firm.
Mueller's investigators unpacked this trunk full of lies from Trump campaign officials. The "investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump campaign lied to (Mueller's office) and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian election interference," the report stated.

Takeaways: Trump thought Mueller would 'end' his presidency and other takeaways from the Mueller report
Some of those who lied, according to the report, violated the federal law:
Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition.
George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser during the campaign, pleaded guilty to lying about the nature and timing of his interactions with a source who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Moscow project.
Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort lied to Mueller's investigators and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications with Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign polling data and a peace plan for Ukraine.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The long-awaited report from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russian investigation did not find conspiracy between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Moscow, but it painted a vivid picture of chaos inside the White House as the president scrambled to react to those allegations.
The report brings to light new details about the frantic first months of Trump's presidency, as senior aides were ordered to carry out presidential instructions that made them uncomfortable. Sometimes senior aides simply ignored his orders, or tried desperately to change his mind.
Trump has for two years brushed aside media reports and tell-all books describing West Wing chaos, suggesting those stories were based on disgruntled former aides and anonymous sources. Though most of the anecdotes included in Mueller's report were previously reported, they will now be harder to explain away as politically motivated fictions.
Mueller's report suggests that, in some instances, Trump's aides were attempting to protect the president by not carrying out his requests. The murkiness around their motivations – and his – are a central reason why it was difficult for the special counsel's team to determine whether the president attempted to obstruct justice.
“The president's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,” Mueller wrote in the report.
In some cases, Mueller said, top White House officials consulted their own personal lawyers before deciding whether to carry out an order from the president.
The report pulls back a curtain on a president who was frustrated and angry by developments taking place beyond his control, and searching for a way to get a handle on an investigation that threatened to consume his presidency and stymie his agenda.
When Attorney General Jeff Sessions informed the president that Mueller was appointed as special counsel, Sessions recalled Trump slouching in his chair and lamenting his fate. "This is the end of my presidency," Trump said. "I'm f---ed. "
McGahn under pressure
One pivotal moment came on a Saturday in June, 2017. Trump was on his first visit to Camp David for what was ostensibly a family retreat but was really a damage-control session after press reports Mueller was investigating obstruction of justice.
Trump called White House Counsel Don McGahn at home twice, asking him to call Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. “Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can't be the Special Counsel,” Trump said, according to McGahn’s statement to Mueller.
McGahn told Trump he didn’t want to be like “Saturday Night Massacre Bork,” referring to Nixon solicitor general Robert Bork who fired a special prosecutor investigating Watergate. Both the attorney general and deputy attorney general refused Nixon’s order and resigned. President Ronald Reagan later nominated Bork to the Supreme Court, though he was not confirmed.
McGahn told colleagues in the White House that he planned to resign, but wouldn’t say why because he didn’t want to involve them. He told then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus only that Trump had asked him to "do crazy sh--. ” Priebus convinced McGahn to stay.
When the New York Times reported on the episode months later, Trump called it “a typical New York Times fake story. ” Privately, he pressured McGahn to deny the story in writing. He called his White House counsel a “lying bastard” and told Staff Secretary Rob Porter, "If he doesn't write a letter, then maybe I'll have to get rid of him. ”
Trump also asked McGahn why he told Mueller that he had threatened to fire the special counsel. "What-about these notes? Why do you take notes?” Trump said. “Lawyers don't take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes. "
Trump react: Trump thought Mueller would 'end' his presidency
Main story: Mueller report documents links between Trump campaign and Russia
'I called him anyway'
As official Washington flipped through the 400-page document, the culmination of a nearly two-year investigation, they were confronted with the details of a president scrambling to deal with a probe he grasped would be politically damaging, even if he believed he had done nothing wrong during the 2016 presidential election.
Similar anecdotes have for years popped up in books and media coverage, which Trump has almost always dismissed as politically motivated hit jobs. Veteran reporter Bob Woodward chronicled an episode in his book "Fear" last year in which former economic adviser Gary Cohn removed a draft of a document from the president's desk to prevent the administration from ending a trade agreement with ally South Korea.
Cohn resigned last year.
Anecdotes in Mueller's report suggest the president's effort to question the investigation often backfired, and occurred over the advice of close aides.
White House attorneys had advised the president not to call then FBI director James Comey in 2017 for fear it would create a perception he was attempting to interfere in the initial stages of the Russian investigation. But Trump made those calls anyway, and told his senior aides after the fact that Comey informed him the FBI could say publicly that the president was not personally under investigation.
"I know you told me not to, but I called Comey anyway," Trump told his aides in April 2017, according to the report.
Less than a month later, Trump fired Comey.
Uncomfortable orders
The Monday after the Camp David visit, Trump met with his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, in the Oval Office. Lewandowski had no formal role in the administration, but Trump asked him to give Sessions a directive.
“Write this down,” Trump said.
Lewandowski wrote it down, and later gave it to Mueller.
Trump directed Sessions to give a speech saying Trump “didn't do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history. ”
He also wanted Lewandowski to tell Sessions to limit the special counsel to only investigating future Russian election meddling – and not obstruction.
But Lewandowski didn’t want to tell Sessions over the phone, and he didn’t want to visit the Justice Department because that would create a record. So Lewandowski and Sessions never met. Instead, Lewandowski asked Rick Dearborn, then the White House deputy chief of staff, to do it.
But Dearborn said the message made him uncomfortable. He told Lewandowski he would take care of it, but didn’t.
Aides push back
A month later, aboard Marine One, Trump told Priebus that Sessions should resign. "I need a letter of resignation on my desk immediately,” he said.
Priebus and McGahn agreed that they would refuse to carry out the order. Trump bugged Priebus about it later in the day. “"Did you get it? Are you working on it?" Priebus said that if Sessions resigned, his top two deputies would also resign.
Instead, Trump stepped up his public criticism of Sessions. For the rest of the year, Sessions had a letter of resignation prepared and carried it with him in his pocket every time he went to the White House.

Texto completo: The White House legal team has reportedly discussed some of the contents of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report with Justice Department officials before its Thursday release.

Justice Department officials have had numerous discussions with White House lawyers about the conclusions that Mueller came to during his investigation into President Trump and Russia, according to a report from the New York Times.

The conversations have reportedly happened in recent days and have helped Trump’s legal team as it prepares a counter-report to Mueller’s report. Last month Attorney General William Barr announced in a four-page letter to Congress that Trump did not conspire with Russia but did not make a determination on whether the president obstructed justice over the course of the 22-month investigation.

Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said that the president’s counter report would likely focus on potential obstruction claims that the report raises. Barr is scheduled to hold a press conference at 9:30 a.m. Thursday to discuss the report, although it is not yet known when the report will be released.

Texto completo: We have learned from numerous press reports that President Donald Trump may have repeatedly - not once, but repeatedly - pressured his top officials to break the law by walling out asylum seekers entirely.
It is a measure of how low we've sunk that if this is all that occurred in connection with this demand - that is, if all Trump did was press his officials to break the law in this fashion - we should probably consider ourselves lucky.
House Democrats are set to initiate an investigation that could illuminate this area of Trumpian misconduct in new ways. Unfortunately, administration officials could still drag their feet aggressively in response to Democratic demands, which could frustrate efforts to gather even the most basic facts about it.
The other day, CNN reported that Trump may have offered a pardon to his acting Homeland Security commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, if he got in trouble for carrying out Trump's border-closing directive.
Relying on two sources, CNN claimed that during a visit to Calexico, California, Trump privately told border agents not to let in any more migrants. Those agents then asked their higher-ups for help, but were informed that they have to follow the law.
Trump also told McAleenan that he'd pardon him if he got in trouble for getting his border agents to do this, senior administration officials told CNN. The New York Times reported a similar story.
It should be noted that Trump denied the claim, and that CNN and the Times both clearly stated that this might have been a joke.
House Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are not treating this as a joke.
In a new letter, they demand that McAleenan make himself available to the committee for questioning about this matter. And they're also looking into reports that Trump also pressured his former DHS secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, to close the border in violation of the law. Her refusal to do so was one reason that Trump ousted her.
Democrats request the following information:
"1. A list identifying all Department employees present for your meeting with President Trump in Calexico, California on or around April 5, 2019 ...
"2. A list identifying all Department employees present for President Trump's April 5, 2019 meeting with border patrol agents, including but not limited to any DHS personnel instructed by President Trump to not let migrants into the country.
"3. Documents and communications relating to Secretary Nielsen's meeting with President Trump on or about March 21, 2019 to discuss reinstating the zero-tolerance policy and closing the U.S. Mexico border at El Paso, Texas.
The letter also demands that any of these others who might have witnessed these conversations should be prepared to testify as well.
Now, it's true that a president's pardon power is near-absolute. But as the letter from Democrats points out, Trump has exhibited a "troubling pattern of conduct that has emerged over the past two years that appears to demonstrate that he "views the pardon power as a political tool, or even worse, as an expedient mechanism for circumventing the law or avoiding the consequences of his own conduct.
That is what might be at stake here. If the story about McAleenan is true, Trump didn't merely demand that he (or his border agents) break the law; he also dangled a pardon as a way for his subordinate to avoid accountability for it later, compounding the corruption.
"It would certainly be an abuse of presidential power, Daniel Hemel, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School who co-wrote a good paper on whether the pardon power can be abused, told me. "The Constitution requires the president to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. If Trump said what he is reported to have said to McAleenan, then he tried to use his presidential power to see to it that the laws aren't executed.
To be clear, this really might have been a joke. Of course, one might ask whether a boss can really "joke with a subordinate about such a matter without the latter wondering whether that "joke was really a tacit command. After all, former fixer Michael Cohen has told us that Trump developed, shall we say, sophisticated ways of communicating orders (such as lying about his ongoing dealings with Russia) while maintaining plausible deniability about having done so. Still, let's put that aside for now.
Notably, Democrats are also demanding that McAleenan and other officials testify to the question of whether Trump ordered subordinates to break the law by closing the border to asylum seekers, irrespective of whether any pardon was dangled.
That alone would be a pretty grave act of misconduct. As the letter from Democrats points out:
"The President's directive to close the Southern border entirely would also run counter to the executive branch's duty to faithfully execute the law. When Border Patrol Agents encounter aliens' who are crossing between ports of entry, they are already on U.S. soil. Under section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, any alien' who is present in the United States' regardless of how they entered are applicants for admission and have the right to seek asylum.
The letter adds that our obligations under international law require this, and that "to instruct DHS officials to do otherwise would explicitly violate these provisions and the law.
Now, we know that Trump has little patience for international law and hates such constraints. He has openly mused about getting rid of immigration judges - that is, doing away with due process for asylum seekers entirely - and has regularly railed about the need to provide that due process. So it would not be at all surprising if he did command his top officials to break the law in this fashion.
And once again, if this is all that happened, we might consider ourselves lucky that it wasn't worse.
It is of course possible that this did not happen at all. In that case, you'd think these officials would be eager to tell Congress so. We will see if that is to be, and how eager the White House is to permit them to appear and clear all this up.

Texto completo: Corea del Norte dijo el jueves que su líder, Kim Jong-un , había supervisado la prueba de disparo de un nuevo tipo de arma guiada táctica, informa New York Times.
La Agencia Central de Noticias Central de Corea del Norte no especificó qué tipo de arma estuvo involucrada en la prueba, por lo que no está claro si fue un misil.
Corea del Norte había declarado una moratoria sobre armas nucleares y pruebas de misiles de largo alcance, después del lanzamiento de un misil balístico intercontinental en noviembre de 2017.
El presidente Trump consideró la moratoria autoimpuesta del Norte como el mayor logro de su administración en sus tratos con Corea del Norte.
Estados Unidos ha intentado negociar con Corea del Norte durante meses para poner fin a sus programas de armas nucleares y misiles cada vez más sofisticados. Pero la última reunión cumbre en febrero entre Trump y Kim terminó abruptamente sin un acuerdo.
Aunque estaba claro de inmediato qué tipo de arma se disparó, la acción marcaría la primera prueba pública de armas desde la cumbre del presidente Trump con Kim en Hanoi en febrero y una señal de desafío por parte de Kim tras un punto muerto en las conversaciones de desnuclearización de alto nivel.

Kathleen Parker column: The Julian Assange problem

Texto completo: Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador's interior minister.
Assange's behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.
If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he's a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans -- including many in the U.S. media -- long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.
No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange's publishing activities.
Then again, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion.
While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first? Despite the recent surge in "citizen journalists," saying you're a journalist doesn't make you one. (Granted, some are better than the "real" ones.)
The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, The Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone's personal emails and under what circumstances?
One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn't accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.
In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government's decades-long campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to The New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.
In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham's bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts -- all while risking great personal and financial loss -- was epic.
Assange's process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.
It isn't hyperbolic to say we're at a hinge point regarding how we gather and disseminate information. Does anyone have the right to publish stolen/classified materials? Should the manner of obtaining information inform the right to publish? For now, at least, the Assange case provides little help, but precedent may offer clues.
On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole -- and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal -- and he published. The difference may be mostly political.
The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg's charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.
Wikileaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.
One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk." Then again, maybe that's just me.

Texto completo: WAYNE — Five of the most accomplished journalists in New Jersey history will be honored this week at William Paterson University in a ceremony being touted as a first for the state.
The New Jersey chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, with the university's chapter of the society, will recognize the inaugural class of the New Jersey Journalism Hall of Fame on Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Martini Room at Hobart Hall. Doors will open at 6:30 p.m.
The inductees, who were nominated by past presidents of the state chapter of the SPJ and approved by its board of directors, include broadcast and print journalists.
"New Jersey has a rich history of great journalism," said John Ensslin, president of the state chapter of the SPJ.
"With our hall of fame at William Paterson," he added, "we will honor journalists who got their start here and went on to great careers elsewhere, or those who made their mark in the Garden State."
Among the inductees are: Jonathan Alter of Montclair, an author and former columnist for Newsweek; John McPhee of Princeton, an author and writer for The New Yorker; and Anna Quindlen, a native of South Brunswick, an author and former columnist for The New York Times.
Two journalists will be recognized posthumously.
Gabe Pressman, a correspondent for WNBC-TV who died in 2017, will be honored with Edith Shapiro, an editor of the now-defunct Newark Evening News who died in 2010.
Ensslin, a former reporter for The Record and NorthJersey.com who now works for ColoradoPolitics.com, said inductees will receive engraved glass trophies.
He said William Paterson was chosen as the site for the inaugural ceremony due, in part, to the partnership that exists between the state and university chapters of the SPJ.
Montclair State University and a restaurant in Newark also were considered as venues, he said.
Ensslin will be among a trio of journalists honored for their recent contributions to the university chapter of the SPJ; he led a podcasting workshop on campus in October.
The ceremony, to be co-hosted by Miriam Ascarelli, vice president of the state chapter of the SPJ, and Nicholas Hirshon, a William Paterson journalism professor, will feature the unveiling of a plaque — bearing the inductees' names — to be on permanent display at Hobart Hall.
Hirshon, who established the university chapter of the SPJ and serves as its adviser, said students are excited for the ceremony.
"They'll get to see someone like Jonathan Alter on their campus, in a room where they have classes," said Hirshon, a former reporter for the Daily News.
"It brings gravitas to that space, and it makes them proud to be William Paterson journalism students," he added. "It just invigorates them to know there's a future in this industry."
Daryl Moore, dean of the university's College of the Arts and Communication, said he sees the upcoming event as a "win-win for professional journalism organizations and our program here at William Paterson."
The university has agreed to host the New Jersey Journalism Hall of Fame ceremony for three straight years, Moore said.
The cost to go to Thursday's ceremony is $20 in advance or $25 at the door. Appetizers and soft drinks will be served.
To buy tickets in advance, visit the New Jersey chapter of the SPJ website. Proceeds will benefit the state and university chapters of the SPJ.

Texto completo: Today is Tuesday,
April 16, the 106th day of 2019. There are 259 days left in the year.
On this date
In 1862, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill ending slavery in the District of Columbia. The Confederacy conscripted all white men between the ages of 18 to 35.
In 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his "Letter from Birmingham Jail" in which the civil rights activist responded to a group of local clergymen who had criticized him for leading street protests; King defended his tactics, writing, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
In 1972, Apollo 16 blasted off on a voyage to the moon with astronauts John W. Young, Charles M. Duke Jr. and Ken Mattingly on board.
In 2007, in one of America's worst school attacks, a college senior killed 32 people on the campus of Virginia Tech before taking his own life.
In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI was welcomed by President George W. Bush as only the second pontiff to visit the White House.
Ten years ago: President Barack Obama issued a statement saying CIA officials who'd used harsh interrogation tactics during the Bush administration would not be prosecuted; the president traveled to Mexico, where he pledged to help the country in its battle against drugs and violence. The crew of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, who'd thwarted pirates off the Somali coast, returned to the U.S.; ship's captain Richard Phillips, held hostage for five days, arrived in Kenya aboard the USS Bainbridge. U.N. nuclear experts who'd been ordered to leave by North Korea departed the country. The Cleveland Indians ruined the Yankees' first game at their new stadium by beating New York 10-2.
Five years ago: More than 300 people, mostly students, died when a South Korean ferry, the Sewol, sank while en route from Incheon to the resort island of Jeju; 172 people survived.
One year ago: The New York Times and The New Yorker won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for breaking the Harvey Weinstein scandal with reporting that galvanized the #MeToo movement. Rap star Kendrick Lamar was awarded the Pulitzer for music, becoming the first non-classical or non-jazz artist to win the prize. American pastor Andrew Brunson went on trial in Turkey in a case that strained ties between that country and the United States; he denied accusations that he aided terror groups or spied against Turkey. (Brunson was convicted but sentenced to time served and was freed from house arrest in October to return to the United States.) Actor Harry Anderson, best known for playing an off-the-wall judge working the night shift of a Manhattan court room on the comedy series "Night Court," was found dead in his North Carolina home; he was 65.
Today's Birthdays: Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI is 92. Actor Peter Mark Richman is 92. Singer Bobby Vinton is 84. Denmark's Queen Margrethe II is 79. Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is 72.

Thought for Today: "The only graceful way to accept an insult is to ignore it; if you can't ignore it, top it; if you can't top it, laugh at it; if you can't laugh at it, it's probably deserved." - Russell Lynes, American writer (1910-1991).

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., must love being the beneficiary of an overprotective news media. She rarely needs to defend herself.

The congresswoman certainly enjoyed its protection this weekend when the Associated Press published a ridiculous report titled, “Study: Fox News is obsessed with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.”

The “study," by the way, comes from the partisan watchdog group Media Matters for America, which was founded in 2004 by Clinton loyalist David Brock for the purpose of “correcting” conservative and right-wing media.

The problem here is not merely that the AP cites the findings of an activist group. (The same AP reporter, David Bauder, has written similar articles based on data collected by the Media Research Center, which is a conservative media watchdog.) The problem here is that the study's thesis, that Fox is uniquely “obsessed” with Ocasio-Cortez, works only if you ignore that the entire news industry is “obsessed” with her. Every good study has a control group. The Media Matters report does not. There is no attempt to review how the congresswoman is covered elsewhere in national media. Rather, the study, which is based entirely on transcripts maintained by the media-monitoring service Grabien, looked only at mentions of “AOC” and “Ocasio” at Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network between Feb. 25 and April 7. From this, Media Matters draws the “obsessed” conclusion.

“The liberal watchdog Media Matters for America, which did the research," the AP reports, noting the study’s finding that the congresswoman “was mentioned 3,181 times on Fox … “during the six-week period of Feb. 25 to April 7, or just under 76 times a day. Not a day went by when she wasn’t spoken about on Fox.”

The AP is silly for amplifying this silly study, which disregards that the young congresswoman is a legitimate media sensation. The attention she gets from Fox is about on par with the attention she gets from every corner of the news media. The only difference is that Fox’s coverage is almost entirely negative, while just about every other newsroom treats her like she's God's gift to the electorate.

No, really, Ocasio-Cortez is a media darling throughout the U.S. press, hailed by cloying journalists as the standard bearer for a younger, more exciting, and more just Democratic Party. Listing the number of times the New York lawmaker has appeared in glossy media profiles is a bit like listing the number of times Rasputin was killed; it just goes on and on and on.

The congresswoman has appeared in plush cover stories for Time magazine, the Hollywood Reporter, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Nation, Vanity Fair, and Rolling Stone magazine. Vogue even featured her in a lavish profile that included a photo shoot with famed photographer Annie Leibovitz. MSNBC also hosted Ocasio-Cortez on March 29 for a town hall, allowing her an enormous amount of air time to promote her preposterous Green New Deal.

And if we want to accuse newsrooms of being “obsessed” based only on the number of times they mention her name over a specific period of time, as Media Matters claimed of Fox, we can do that, too.

Ocasio-Cortez’s name has appeared in more than 200 Washington Post op-eds and articles in the last 60 days. Also, in the time frame specified by the Media Matters study, the congresswoman’s name has appeared in at least 90 New York Times op-eds and articles. The AP itself wrote at least a dozen articles focusing exclusively on Ocasio-Cortez’s words and actions.

Between Feb. 25 and April 7, CNN mentioned “AOC” and “Ocasio” approximately 230 times, according to Grabien. MSNBC mentioned her at least 660 times. Then there are the networks. ABC News mentioned “AOC” and “Ocasio” an estimated 1,929 times in the last 40 days, according to TVEyes. NBC News, meanwhile, had 3,418 mentions of the same keywords, while CBS had a smaller 1,761 mentions.

It is not just Fox News that has a hankering for all things Ocasio-Cortez. This entire industry is a bit besotted with the freshman congresswoman. The thing that sets Fox apart from the rest is that it covers her critically.

High-intensity exercise shown to slow progression of Parkinson's

Texto completo: The gloves come on during Emily Moncheski’s specialized fitness classes.
Her five students in this session at Old School Boxing Gym belly up to the punching bag and prepare to jab for their lives.
The two women and three men have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. But they refuse to bow to the degenerative condition that can dismantle bodies over time.
They come to Moncheski to get their heart rates up, to sweat, to challenge their bodies with physical exercise that combines big movements with cognitive games. Recent research indicates high-intensity exercise is one of the best things a Parkinson’s patient can do.
“Amplitude training — big movements — actually slows the progression of Parkinson’s,” said Moncheski, a physical therapist who specializes in working with those who have the disease. “It’s the only thing that slows the progression. Any medications just treat symptoms.”
She cites a University of Colorado study that compared people who walked on a treadmill at moderate to high intensity (based on their heart rates) with a group that walked at a self-selected pace. The latter progressed in the disease compared with those who worked at a higher intensity.
“If they went at their own leisurely pace and weren’t pushing it, they weren’t getting this symptom prevention,” Moncheski said. “It (exercise) affects neurochemicals and helps the brain make better connections.”
Actor Alan Alda revealed last year that he’d been diagnosed with Parkinson’s three and a half years earlier. He’s had a full life since, he said, and urged others not to be afraid if they were diagnosed.
“You still have things you can do,” he told The New York Times. Exercise is one of his staples: boxing three times a week, playing tennis and marching to John Philip Sousa music.
When Mary Roney was diagnosed at 62, her neurologist told her it wasn’t the end of the world and that she had 10 good years left. That wasn’t good enough for Roney, who wanted to be proactive. She found Moncheski through a Parkinson’s symposium and now does one-on-one sessions with the physical therapist, as well as her boxing and high-intensity classes. Roney also works with a personal trainer at the gym and does Nia, a nonimpact movement class that blends martial arts, dance arts and healing arts.
“I’ve stemmed the progression of it. I’m more than holding my own,” said Roney, 66. “I’ve noticed my gait has become better. My fine motor skills are better. Not that I’ve been inactive, but I’m making a focus of working out. The alternative is unacceptable to me because it’s going to hit my quality of life.”
The 55-minute, boot camp-style class begins with a disclaimer about brain games by Moncheski: “We’re doing multiple things at one time so don’t get frustrated.” With some upbeat ‘60s music in the background, she gets to work warming up the crowd. Early exercises are aimed at helping participants learn to catch themselves if they start to fall backward, while others are designed to help them practice moving their feet when they feel glued to the ground, a common Parkinson’s symptom called freezing.
Then comes the session’s main focus: big movements paired with some “brain sweat,” Moncheski said. The participants lunge forward and call out a letter of the alphabet, then lunge backward and call out ascending numbers in increments of two — a challenging task for anyone.
After a lighthearted exercise involving chairs and reacting to baby cries, dog barks and bird calls on Moncheski’s phone, she has the students enter the boxing ring and lie down, all their heads meeting in the middle in a starfish pattern. A bit more brain work coupled with some final stretches winds the class down.
Early symptoms of Parkinson’s differ by person but can include a foot that drags while walking, an arm that doesn’t naturally swing or an unnaturally quiet voice. The disease causes everything to get smaller and slower, including the voice.
Singer-songwriter Linda Ronstadt is a prime example. She noticed vocal difficulties in 2000 and was forced to retire in 2009, though her official diagnosis didn’t come until 2013.
“And then you have to learn to ask people to help, and that — that took a little doing,” she said in a CBS News report this year. “But I do that now, because I need the help.”
It’s why Moncheski has her clients make big movements and get loud while doing it.
“A person with Parkinson’s needs to be challenged,” she said. “It needs to be novel and new. No class looks the same. It helps keep their attention. And when they’re engaged, that’s when the brain makes new connections. It’s neuroplasticity.”
It’s improving thinking while moving, which is what life requires of us all. Picking up the phone while talking to somebody and not tripping is usually second nature but can be challenging for Parkinson’s patients as they lose the neurotransmitter dopamine. Moncheski’s exercises are designed to improve balance by training the brain to switch tasks quickly while maintaining quality of movement.
“We’re rewiring that area of the brain that relies on dopamine. We’re using a different section of the brain versus the automatic section you and I get to use,” she said. “We don’t have to think about swinging our arms as we walk. It just happens. That’s because of dopamine. People with Parkinson’s don’t have that. If we say pick up your foot or swing your arm, they can do it by accessing the motor control area of the brain.”
The ideal amount of exercise for those with Parkinson’s is three to five days a week of 20 to 30 minutes of high intensity cardio paired with balance, strengthening and cognitive engagement. Attending a class with others who have the disease also provides community and social benefits.
Moncheski has seen firsthand the effectiveness of the protocol. It propelled her to complete Parkinson Wellness Training four years ago and begin offering classes.
“I started seeing people get better and was hooked,” she said. “I’ve had people come to classes and go back to their doctor, who almost second-guesses their diagnosis because they’re not progressing. You expect Parkinson’s to progress.”
Roney is still in the first of Parkinson’s five stages. A trembling right hand initially got her to the doctor. Late last year, she was put on a dopamine drug, but in the face of a degenerative disease, she feels as if she’s winning if she’s holding her own.
“Everybody’s on something different and different doses,” Roney said. “It’s a really perplexing disease to figure out. They want to cure it, but I’d be happy if they were able to find something that stemmed it.”

Disappointing epilogue to a beautiful send-off; Violence blasts love shown at Nipsey Hussle's memorial

Texto completo: The large, predominantly black crowd outside Staples Center was antsy, the way most crowds are when a concert or game is about to start and people are anxious to get inside.
There were conversations between strangers, laughter and an abundance of respect. The community had gathered Thursday to honor the life of Ermias Asghedom, and the one thought that kept repeating in my head was, "Look how beautiful we are." This thought was in contrast to how I felt when looking across the street at the barricades blocking chunks of L.A. Live normally open during other events at Staples: "Look how ugly we are expected to get."
And then we didn't disappoint.

The marathon continues, but cannibalism dwindles the numbers along the way. The harmonious atmosphere that wrapped downtown Los Angeles in warmth in the morning dissipated later in day at the corner of 103rd and Main streets as gunfire claimed one life and injured three more.
All the victims were black -- again. It was a disappointing epilogue to what had been a heartwarming send-off. Obviously when there is an event involving thousands, there are going to be folks with a different agenda.
And although I'm not a subscriber to respectability politics, one would hope on a day in which the country is watching a beloved figure and community activist being celebrated that a drive-by shooting would be the last thing on a person's mind. But then I've covered enough high-profile incidents of gun violence, followed by high-profile funerals, followed by high-profile disturbances to know the barricades at L.A. Live were not unwarranted.
The heavy police presence was justifiable.
Calls for peace are far too often made in vain.
Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this is knowing that the shooting will be characterized -- if not casually dismissed -- as an example of "black-on-black crime," as if "white-on-white crime" isn't a thing or American culture as a whole is nonviolent. The U.S. makes up roughly 5% of the globe's population, but we ranked second in firearm deaths in 2016. It's not "them" and "they." This is "us."
More than one speaker during Hussle's memorial made the connection between his death at 33 years of age and that of Jesus. While I found the loose connection too close for my comfort, it did get me thinking about that number.
It's been nearly 33 years since Scott La Rock, a onetime social worker who connected with rapper KRS-One to create Boogie Down Productions, was gunned down in the Bronx. Like Hussle, he was shot in the head.
The headline of the New York Times article back then could very well fit with recent Los Angeles Times coverage of Hussle: "Violent Death Halts Rap Musician's Rise." Certainly this passage from the New York Times' article mirrored the two lives: "He was described as a big brother, a pied piper, a leader and inspiration to youth."
La Rock's death, along with that of a young man who was at a BDP/Public Enemy concert, prompted KRS-One to create the Stop the Violence Movement. That led to the single "Self Destruction," one of the greatest songs in hip-hop history.
Proceeds from the track were donated to the National Urban League. When it dropped, it felt as if a significant change was going to come. Nearly 33 years later, Staples was filled with thousands who came to mourn the violent passing of another big brother, pied piper, leader and inspiration to our youth.
Unfortunately, "Self Destruction" appears to be less of a turning point and more like Shakespearean foreshadowing. And after Hussle's memorial was marred with gun violence and death, I couldn't prevent tears from pooling in my eyes. I was hoping to focus on the beautiful tributes from his mother, Angelique Smith; his fiancee, Lauren London; brother Samiel Asghedom; and Snoop Dogg.
I wanted to focus on how the Congressional Black Caucus commemorated his life and how the L.A. City Council was expected to rename the intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard and Slauson Avenue after him.
But it would be disingenuous to wax poetic on the ramifications of his death when the circumstances that followed it crowbarred their way into the narrative.
I hesitated writing about Hussle because I wasn't originally from Los Angeles and I lacked the institutional wisdom to fully appreciate his impact on the city.
But I grew up on the east side of Detroit, and I know more than enough about gun violence and the pathological behavior that contributes to the undermining of my community's progress.
I've lived in Chicago, Atlanta and New York, and so I know that the external and internal issues that cripple black people in Detroit and Los Angeles are not exclusive to those two cities. All of the speeches by Minister Louis Farrakhan, performances by Stevie Wonder and letters from former President Obama won't mean a thing if we don't have the fortitude to value life the next day.
I don't write this because I'm seeking approval from white readers.
I'm writing this because I've been in the streets hustling in the '80s, I've been in jail in the '90s, and I've been caught in tear gas covering the Ferguson, Mo., uprising in the 2000s, so I know Hussle's death -- like La Rock's nearly 33 years ago -- will become a faded memory if we don't replicate the love and respect we showed each other outside of Staples.

Texto completo: The Times won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting Monday for its series of stories about a former USC gynecologist accused of sexually abusing hundreds of students during three decades at a campus clinic.
Three investigative reporters with The Times -- Harriet Ryan, Matt Hamilton and Paul Pringle -- were named by Pulitzer Prize judges. Their reporting began in February 2018 with an anonymous tip about allegations of misconduct against Dr. George Tyndall, who had quietly left the campus clinic where he had practiced for 27 years. The reporters worked three months to track down people who had information about Tyndall, uncovering troubling allegations of abuse of young patients.
The series roiled the prestigious private university, which lies in the heart of Los Angeles, and led to dramatic changes, including the resignation of university President C.L. Max Nikias. His tenure was marked by an increase in the university's status and fundraising abilities but tarnished by scandals.

On Monday, the newspaper's staff had gathered in the center of its seventh-floor newsroom in El Segundo a few minutes before Columbia University announced the winners of the 2019 Pulitzer Prizes. When Ryan, Hamilton and Pringle's award was announced, the staff erupted in loud and sustained applause.
"I want to take a moment to appreciate the women of USC. They are impressive, they defy stereotypes and they deserved better," Ryan told the newsroom.
"I am also particularly grateful, and I know my colleagues are, to our sources. People who took risks to talk to us -- we couldn't have done the story without them," Ryan said. Among the unnamed sources were "a group of women who spoke to us who have low-level jobs and they risked their paychecks and their ability to provide for their families because they wanted the truth to come out and they saw the newspaper as a vehicle for that."
The award marks the 45th Pulitzer Prize won by The Times since 1942 and comes as the newspaper is undergoing an unprecedented period of rebuilding following its purchase by Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong in June. The turnaround comes after years of layoffs and management upheaval.
"The award recognizes an extraordinary piece of journalism that continues the Los Angeles Times' commitment to publishing stories that affect the lives of our readers," said Norman Pearlstine, The Times' executive editor. "Through all of the turmoil, over so many years, there was a group of people who remained committed to the Los Angeles Times and committed to creating great journalism that served the public interest."
Ryan, in her remarks, mentioned the symbolism of accepting one of journalism's highest honors following a turbulent year when the newsroom was undergoing great strain, including battles with former managers and ownership. The newsroom voted to unionize and the staff was relocated from its historic headquarters in downtown Los Angeles to El Segundo.
"The L.A. Times is going to win many awards over the next 100 years -- Pulitzers and everything else," Ryan said. "I don't know if any award will ever be as sweet as this one. There are so many people in this building who know that we almost died. There are so many of my colleagues in the newsroom who fought to save the paper."
Ryan received the anonymous tip that launched the reporting on the series. The caller refused to provide a name or specific details. Intrigued, Ryan and Hamilton began searching public records for information that might identify Tyndall as a problem doctor. They found nothing. They compiled a list of current and former clinic employees and, along with Pringle, started knocking on doors and asking questions.
The three soon discovered that people had long-standing concerns about the gynecologist but that most were too afraid to share their stories. They feared losing their jobs.
Ryan, Hamilton and Pringle spent months documenting how complaints about Tyndall began in the 1990s, when co-workers alleged that he was improperly photographing students' genitals during medical exams. Over the years, patients and nursing staff repeatedly accused him of "creepy" behavior, including touching women inappropriately during pelvic exams and making sexually suggestive remarks about their bodies.
The first story, published in May 2018, unleashed a new flood of complaints and within days hundreds of women had come forward with allegations of misconduct.
The series triggered local, state and federal investigations. A task force of police detectives interviewed women across the country, a review that grew into the Los Angeles Police Department's largest sex crimes investigation of a single suspect. Tyndall has strongly denied any wrongdoing.
More than 650 women filed suit against USC, alleging that the university failed to protect them from sexual abuse. USC last fall agreed to pay $215 million to resolve a federal class-action lawsuit, the first in what is expected to be a wave of settlements.
During the celebration, Managing Editor Scott Kraft praised the commitment to fearless journalism, as well as the primary editors on the series, Shelby Grad and Jack Leonard. The paper's owners, Soon-Shiong and his wife, Michele Chan, also were in the newsroom to congratulate the team.
The most prestigious journalism Pulitzer, the Gold Medal for public service, went to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, which exposed the failings of school and law enforcement officials before and after the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The staff of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won for breaking news reporting for its "immersive, compassionate coverage of the massacre at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue," according to the prize judges.
The Chico Enterprise-Record in Northern California, in partnership with the Bay Area News Group, was a finalist in the breaking news category for its coverage of the Camp fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise and killed more than 80 people. The story was deeply personal for the newspaper's small staff -- many of whom lost homes and waited to learn whether loved ones had survived.
The New York Times was honored for explanatory reporting for an exhaustive 18-month investigation of President Trump's finances, which debunked his claims of self-made wealth. The Wall Street Journal won for national reporting for uncovering Trump's hush-money payoffs to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, during his campaign.
The staff of the Advocate of Baton Rouge, La., was singled out in local reporting for chronicling Louisiana's discriminatory court system. The international reporting prize went to two organizations: the Associated Press for its yearlong series that detailed atrocities of the war in Yemen, including the deployment of child soldiers, and the staff of Reuters for shedding light on the military units and Buddhist villagers responsible for the systematic murder of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, coverage that landed reporters in prison.
Hannah Dreier of ProPublica received the feature writing prize for documenting the experiences of Salvadoran immigrants in New York following a botched federal crackdown on the MS-13 crime group. Tony Messenger of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch won the commentary award; Carlos Lozada of the Washington Post won for criticism and Brent Staples of the New York Times won for editorial writing.
Pulitzers were also awarded for news and feature photography and in the following arts categories: fiction, nonfiction, drama, history, biography, poetry and music.

Texto completo: Here's what we know about the fire that hit Monday at Notre Dame de Paris cathedral, a Paris landmark and a French national treasure:
■The fire burst through the roof of the centuries-old cathedral and consumed its towering spire, which collapsed, followed by the entire roof, Reuters reported.
■The fire's cause is unknown, reported Agence France-Presse.
■The blaze, which spread extremely quickly, took hold in the loft of the building, firefighters told AFP. The fire alarm was sounded at about 6:30 p.m. local time, a cathedral spokesman told told The New York Times.
■AFP reported that a part of the Ile de La Cite neighborhood where the cathedral is situated, at the heart of Paris, was being evacuated at around 7:30 p.m. local time.
■The Associated Press reported around 9 p.m. that the mammoth blaze had spread from the spire to one of the church's rectangular towers. Paris police said firefighters were working both inside and outside the building, while red smoke poured out of the cathedral. The church's entire wooden interior was in flames, a cathedral spokesman said.
■As the fire grew, older Parisians looking on began to cry, lamenting the loss of a national treasure, the Times reported. French president Emmanuel Macron tweeted that, like all French citizens, “I am sad tonight to see this part of us burn."
■Authorities are investigating if renovation work on the cathedral's fire was a factor in starting or spreading the fire, AP reported.
■There was no immediate word on any injuries.
■ Notre Dame is the most famous of the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages. The foundation stone was laid by Pope Alexander III in 1163. It was built on the ruins of two earlier churches and before that, the site was used for a Gallo-Roman temple dedicated to Jupiter, acccording to britannica.com.

Bernie Sanders releases 10 years of tax returns

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, released 10 years' worth of tax returns on Monday, showing the man who routinely derides "millionaires and billionaires" earned more than a $1 million in income in 2016.

The financial disclosure was highly anticipated given Sanders only published his 2014 tax filings in 2016 when he contested the party's nomination against Hillary Clinton. The filings also show income generated by his wife, Jane Sanders, who was investigated for allegations that she, as president of Burlington College, overstated "confirmed" donation amounts when trying to secure a $6.7 million loan in 2010. The school closed in 2016 due to financial problems, and Jane Sanders was not charged by federal prosecutors over the claims.

According to the documents, the Sanders' adjusted gross income in 2018 was $561,293 and the couple donated 3.4 percent to charities, including senior centers, low-income organizations, educational entities, and environmental and housing advocacy groups.

In 2016 the Sanders' adjusted gross income was $1,062,626, but they claimed only $10,600, or .99%, in charitable giving.

The independent senator from Vermont, who self-identifies as a Democratic socialist and whose White House bids have been underpinned by the argument that the economy is rigged to benefit the top 1% of earners in the country, sought to diffuse expected criticism in twin statements.

"The returns reflect that the Sanders’ primary sources of income over most of those years were Senator Sanders’ Senate salary and proceeds from his writing," the senator's campaign said in a "key details" section of the statement.

"In 2016, the Sanders’ income increased substantially due to advances and royalties from his best-selling book Our Revolution: A Future To Believe In, which has been translated into 5 languages and published in a number of countries," the statement added. "The youth version of Our Revolution, the publication of Where We Go From Here and an advance on a book currently being written by Jane Sanders, are also reflected in the tax filings."

The senator acknowledged on Monday the returns "show that our family has been fortunate."

"I am very grateful for that, as I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck and I know the stress of economic insecurity. That is why I strive every day to ensure every American has the basic necessities of life, including a livable wage, decent housing, health care and retirement security.” he wrote in a statement. “I consider paying more in taxes as my income rose to be both an obligation and an investment in our country. I will continue to fight to make our tax system more progressive so that our country has the resources to guarantee the American Dream to all people.”

Last week Sanders alluded to his wealth in an interview with the New York Times, and urged President Trump to be similarly transparent about his assets. Referring to his book that was No. 3 on the New York Times bestseller list, Sanders told supporters that he "didn’t know it was a crime to write a good book."

The Vermont lawmaker currently sits in second place for the Democratic nomination, according to the latest RealClearPolitics polling average. He trails former Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a presidential run, by a little less than 10 percentage points.

Texto completo: Sydney Paige Monfries , una estudiante de 22 años, cayó de más de 12 metros de altura por querer tomarse una “selfie” panorámica de Nueva York, desde la torre del reloj de la Universidad de Fordham.
Los hechos ocurriero el domingo en la madrugada, alrededor de las 2:00 a.m., cuando la joven –becaria de la revista InStyle y estudiante de periodismo– y otros compañeros subieron a la torre, a pesar de que estaba prohibido.
Ella era asidua a las selfies, como se puede ver sus perfil de Facebook, pero el domingo murió, tras caer al interior de la torre, tuvo una fractura craneoencefálica, incluso los paramédicos lograron resucitarla en el lugar, pero la joven originaria de Portland, Oregón, murió más tarde en el hospital.

“Con gran tristeza informo que Sydney Monfries, estudiante del Fordham College en Rose Hill, murió hoy después de sufrir una caída dentro de la torre del Reloj Keating en las primeras horas de la mañana. Nuestros corazones están con los padres de Sydney, su familia y amigos” , escribió el presidente de la escuela, Joseph McShane . “No hay palabras suficientes para describir la pérdida de alguien tan joven y lleno de promesas, y solo semanas antes de la graduación”.
El funcionario académico indicó la joven recibirá una licenciatura póstuma, la cual entregarán a los padres.
La torre es un lugar prohibido para los jóvenes, pero eso no ha detenido a los estudiantes curiosos de echar un vistazo.
“Es como una cosa de alto nivel ir al edificio más popular del campus” , dijo Priscilla Morales, una estudiante de psicología, al New York Times. “Recientemente supimos que la puerta estaba abierta o se encontró un acceso. Por lo general, van tarde por la noche alrededor de la 1 o 2 a.m. para beber y disfrutar la vista”.

In Spygate, did US agencies act appropriately?

Texto completo: What's in a word? When the word is spying, it could mean defending American democracy, or trying to undermine it.
On Wednesday Attorney General Bill Barr startled senators when he said during a budget hearing that he believed that "spying did occur" during the 2016 presidential race, and that "spying on a political campaign is a big deal." He tempered his statement by adding "the question is whether it was adequately predicated" and was not ready to say that "improper surveillance occurred"; but he is "concerned about it and looking into it."
Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, took issue with Barr's word choice, saying "the word 'spying' could cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out." And of course they did. NBC News' Chuck Todd said this was a "conspiracy theory" for which there was "zero factual basis." Furious Democrats denounced Barr for even raising the issue.
Luckily the evidence may be on its way. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is near the end of his investigation into possible abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) with respect to targeting former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Since the FISA warrant was the predicate for subsequent surveillance, the impending IG report potentially will reveal whether it was legitimately obtained. Recently revealed text messages between FBI lawyer Lisa Page and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe show that the issue of biased sources was being hotly contested even days before the warrant application. If the warrant was in fact issued on the weight of the notorious "Steele dossier," which was underwritten by the Clinton campaign, then all that followed could fall under the "improper surveillance" rubric.
Intelligence treated Trump like the enemy Obama-era officials like former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have cast the effort to investigate Russian influence in the Trump campaign as a standard counterintelligence operation. As such, they were just doing their duty.
But there are some problems with this narrative. One is that if foreign entities were attempting seriously to subvert the Trump campaign, it would have made most sense immediately to warn Donald Trump. Once alerted he could have insulated his campaign from foreign influence, fired members of the campaign who were already compromised, and worked actively with the intelligence community and the FBI to expose the malign foreign network.
The intelligence community treated Trump's campaign like a target. Instead of helping Trump block Russia from penetrating his organization, it seems more like the agencies were hoping to discover that a collusion network was up and running.
Did partisan agencies spy on Trump? We've been down this rhetorical road before. In May 2018 when reports surfaced about the FBI using an informant to target Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, Trump made repeated references to a "spy" being planted in his campaign. The New York Times countered that this was an "investigation." Clapper referred to it as "observing." Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa called it using an "intelligence source." And in this context none of those terms is materially different from what most people understand as spying.
Spygate is more than a semantic debate. The issue is whether high ranking officials in various government agencies abused their power to conduct intelligence gathering on a major party presidential campaign for a political purpose. The attorney general calls that spying. President Trump calls it treason. And when all the evidence is laid bare the American people can call it as they see it.

Texto completo: A former professional soccer player and private in the British Army's Parachute Regiment is looking to bring his company to the United States, and he has his sights set on Charleston.
Terry Nelson created Aqua Running, a buoyancy suit designed to help those who are injured or have physical challenges exercise more easily in the water. He visited Charleston this weekend to meet with local business leaders about warehousing and manufacturing the suits in the city.
He also led a training course for veterans at the University of Charleston pool, demonstrating how to use the suits. Veterans from as far away as Texas and Minnesota flew in to get a first-hand look at the suits.
Nelson is hoping they'll become "ambassadors for his company, meaning they will sell and teach people how to use the suits.
"Military veterans are the most important people to deliver the training because of their focus, work ethic and attitude, Nelson said.
Overseas, many high-profile athletes and teams have used the Aqua Running suits, including professional soccer clubs Arsenal and Real Madrid and star players Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale.
However, elite athletes aren't the only clientele Nelson intends to serve.
"We have the richest sports franchise in the world use the suits. It's great for elite sports, but the benefit is for the wider population, he said.
This broad population can include people with disabilities and physical and mental challenges, and those who struggle with obesity, Nelson said. Since it removes 90 percent of a person's body weight in the water, Nelson said it's a good fit for people who face some of these obstacles.
The suits have garnered media attention from national outlets such as Fox and The New York Times, which has led to several veterans reaching out to Nelson. One of them was Randy Ross, owner of Charleston-based Scout Services, a business focused on bringing new technologies to West Virginia.
"He actually sold West Virginia to me, and Charleston in particular, Nelson said. "He told me the benefits of locating to Charleston.
Ross said that West Virginia has the kind of broad population Nelson is looking to serve.
"We're number one in obesity. We have one of the oldest populations in the country, and we have just a multitude of challenges, Ross said. "Right here is a built-in opportunity to help people.
After talking with Ross, Nelson said he knew he was someone he could trust.
"It was the way Randy came across, Nelson said. "I have sharp-suited businessmen talk to me all the time, and that's not what I wanted. I wanted someone who believed in this.
Right now, the suits are manufactured in China and stored in a warehouse in Charleston, South Carolina. However, Nelson said he would like to see both production and storage of the suits take place in the same location.
Nelson said he aims to have the suits warehoused in West Virginia in the near future, but the manufacturing aspect might take longer.
One place Nelson is considering as a possible location is a building located behind Appalachian Power Park along Morris Street. He said he is also in talks with the Charleston Area Alliance and local developers to discuss possible locations on the city's West Side.
While at UC, they also floated the idea of a possible partnership to university leaders, Ross said.
The idea for the Aqua Running company was born from Nelson's personal hardship. His military career was cut short when his army physical revealed a blood problem that led to kidney failure.
He has had two kidney transplants, with the first coming from his brother, Dean. Nelson said at first his goal wasn't to start a company like Aqua Running or help those in need.
"It was to repay my brother, Nelson said. "He gave up his military career for me.
Nelson said he thought competing in the 1993 World Transplant Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, would be the way to do that. He was successful, but after he won the games his donated kidney began to fail.
After receiving a second transplant, his perspective changed. He wanted to help people.
Nelson spent 12 years on dialysis and recalled the way being active and exercising helped him cope with his illness and the side effects of his treatment.
While preparing for the games, he would exercise using a flotation device while jogging in the pool. He said he would feel uplifted afterwards, even if it was just temporary.
"I'd go home and think about running the Great Wall of China for a couple of hours, and then I'd feel sick again, he said.
Nelson wanted to help people feel the same relief he did, so he decided to create the Aqua Running suit, made from nylon, Lycra and foam padding. He said being active is what kept him alive.
"It helped me to decide that life was worth living, Nelson said. "I know 100 percent that we can help these military veterans or anyone who needs help.

Desperate, but away from chaos

Texto completo: ON THE VENEZUELA-COLOMBIA BORDER - She is 15 years old, pregnant, hungry and alone. Deisimar sat on a bench in a park in Maicao, just inside Colombia, and wept as she told her story - the story of Venezuela.
Deisimar was born in an oil-rich, middle-class Venezuela. Then everything began to collapse at a pace reminiscent of Weimar Germany or Syria during the civil war.
In the oil hub of Maracaibo, Deisimar's family lost electricity, reliable running water, health care and, finally, food. Venezuela's inflation may reach 10 million percent this year, the International Monetary Fund says, and some people root through garbage or eat rats to survive.
"We had no money to buy food, so I came here," Deisimar explained. Complicating the situation, she had become pregnant by her equally impoverished 18-year-old boyfriend. Contraception has become unavailable or unaffordable: A single condom now costs as much as a couple of pounds of rice and more than a tank of gas.
"I don't have enough to eat, so how could I pay for birth control?" Deisimar asked me.
She walks about selling medicines from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day. She eats at a soup kitchen when she can, but there are long lines because there are so many desperate Venezuelans here, with hundreds sleeping in the park each night.
Deisimar hasn't been to a clinic for any prenatal care, and she doesn't know what will happen to her. "Nobody in my family knows I'm pregnant," she said.
After traveling along the border with Mercy Corps, an aid group helping Venezuelans in this border region, I ache with stories from so many people like Deisimar. More than 3.4 million Venezuelans have fled their country so far, according to the United Nations, and millions more are expected to follow this year.
American liberals sometimes sympathize with the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, out of instinctive resistance to President Donald Trump. Don't. Maduro has been a catastrophe for Venezuelans, and Trump is right to join Canada and more than 50 other countries in recognizing the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.
The problem is that Trump's saber-rattling backfires, helping Maduro by playing into a narrative of Yankee imperialism, and his politicization of humanitarian aid makes it less likely that starving people will actually be fed.
Here's a three-part strategy that some other countries are already moving toward: Nudge Mexico (which has refused to back Guaidó) to play a more constructive role; work with Canada, Peru and Colombia to coax and coerce Venezuela's generals away from Maduro; and offer Maduro a comfortable retirement abroad if he steps down, versus a prison cell if he remains.
Venezuelans overwhelmingly told me that they want tougher international action to dislodge Maduro. "I lost my jobs because of sanctions," said Claritza Rojas, who used to work for PDVSA, the state oil company, and now is homeless in Maicao. "They affect us, but pressure on Maduro is still good."
Conditions may get worse, for the economy and health system are virtually in free fall. A university survey found that two-thirds of Venezuelans had lost weight - an average of 25 pounds in a single year.
"Sometimes we went two or three days without eating anything," a mother, Anyi Coromoto, 25, told me, a day after arriving from Maracaibo with her son, Dylan. Dylan, 1 year old, weighs 11 pounds and was immediately hospitalized to save his life.
In a world that has mostly treated migrants wretchedly, Colombia is playing a heroic role in providing such care. The country has admitted perhaps 2 million Venezuelans - often allowing them to work, attend school and receive free health care. And ordinary Colombians routinely give food to hungry Venezuelans on the street; the world has much to learn from warmhearted Colombians.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said he plans to release 10 years' worth of his tax returns by April 15, but there are some things about his finances that can be gleaned from information already made public.
In a story published by the The New York Times on Tuesday, Sanders said, "We wanted to release 10 years of tax returns. April 15, 2019, will be the 10th year, so I think you will see them."
Candidates' tax return has become an issue in the 2020 presidential campaign.
Donald Trump has refused to release his return, a first among recent presidents, and is fighting efforts by House Democrats to obtain the records. The New York Times reports, "Mr. Trump is the first president in four decades to not publicly release his tax returns."
Several of Sanders' Democratic opponents have already release their returns including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, as well as Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.
The independent senator for Vermont never released his returns during his 2016 presidential bid, saying after Democrats formally nominated Hillary Clinton in August that he saw no need because he was no longer a candidate.
This time around, he put off questions about when he would release his returns by answering "soon." Pressed shortly after announcing his candidacy in February, Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, "Our tax returns will bore you to death, nothing special about them."
Here's what we know so far about Sanders' finances.
Bernie Sanders is a millionaire Sanders earns an annual salary of $174,000 as a U.S. senator, but his outside income far outstrips his government pay.
Sanders' Senate financial disclosure form show the democratic socialist took in more than $1.7 million in royalties, including $1.3 million in advances, in 2016 and 2017, almost all of it from the publisher MacMillian.
Sanders' last books, "Where We Go from Here: Two Years in the Resistance " published last year made best-seller lists.
He told the New York Times, "If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."
Sanders earns royalties from his musical album Among his other royalty payments were $539.47 in 2017 and $2,520.60 in 2016 from Todd R. Lockwood Works for "We Shall Overcome," a folk album recorded in 1987 featuring then-Mayor Sanders and release on cassette tape.
The recording was reissued in 2014 and gained attention during Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. The album is available today as an MP3 download and on CD.
Sanders also receives about $5,000 a year in pension payments from the city of Burlington, where he served as mayor for eight years.
Most assets are investments in the name of his wife, Jane Sanders Sanders' 2018 financial disclosure form listed total assets between $235,000 and $1.17 million. The form lists the value of assets as a range rather than give exact figures.
Almost all of the assets — mutual funds as well as two bank accounts — are under Jane Sanders' name.
Two bank accounts totaling between $50,002 and $325,000, are listed as "joint." The larger of the two with between $100.001 and $250,000 is with the U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union, a checking account noted as "Money held for tax payments."
Sanders owns a house in Burlington and bought a $575,000 lakeside second home in North Hero in 2016.
Bernie Sanders donates his speaking fees to charity Bernie Sanders received $4,050 for five appearances in 2016, with all of the money donated to charity. In 2015, the total was $3,885 for three appearances, again all donated to charity.
In 2014, three appearances earned Sanders $1,807.42, but only $850 went to charity. The filing shows Sanders kept money for two appearances —$1,017.42 — from the publisher of his book with the text of this marathon Senate floor speech in 2011.
For 2017, he listed no payments for speaking engagements or other appearances.

Texto completo: Students in Akron whose public school system labeled as the city's worst-performing pupils have turned things around in big way after enrolling in LeBron James' school.
I Promise's inaugural class of third- and fourth-graders is closing the achievement gap, according to the New York Times.
"These kids are doing an unbelievable job, better than we all expected," James told the Times.
In fact, the students at I Promise posted "extraordinary results" during their first district assessments, where 90 percent of met or exceeded individual growth goals in reading and math, the Times reported.
Much Respect
To begin the year, both third- and fourth-graders scored in the lowest percentile, or 1%.
At year's end, third-graders soared into the ninth percentile and fourth-graders moved into 16th.
In addition, math scores took an even more dramatic jump. Third-graders went from 1% to 18%, while fourth-graders rose from two to the 30th percentile.
Not bad for some kids who were written off as, according to the Times, "irredeemable."
Crushing It
James says the results show that children at I Promise are responding better to teaching methods that they had not prior to attending his school.
"Now people are going to really understand the lack of education they had before they came to our school," the NBA superstar said. "People are going to finally understand what goes on behind our doors."
What is that, exactly?
I Promise has a longer day and school year. In addition there is free breakfast, lunch and snacks, and free transportation within two miles of the school.
The school also provides food and clothing to the families of students in need.
Continuing its focus on families, I Promise provides parents with G.E.D preparation opportunities, work advice, health and legal services, and even a quarterly barbershop, the Times reported.
Oh, and King James also guarantees tuition for all students who graduate from I Promise.

Texto completo: "Optics." This word seems to be a trendy addition to our vocabulary. Like me, you have probably encountered it most often in political reporting.
By doing a little research, I was surprised to learn that William Safire wrote about this term a decade ago in his last column for On Language, a once regular feature in the New York Times Magazine.
In essence, Safire (and later his successor, Bill Zimmer) noted that the term "optics" is merely a scientific-sounding buzzword for image-making. How the "optics" are understood is critical; but it is not always the same for every person.
Notably, reading images does not begin in adulthood; rather, it is rooted in childhood, specifically picture books. In the world of education, we call this visual literacy, the ability to derive meaning from image.
To interpret a picture in a children's book, a visually literate reader considers the composition of the picture and sees beyond the colors and lines to the social constructs that are revealed. (And, yes, children do this! But they do this better if adults help!)
If you want to enhance your children's visual literacy, start by selecting a few wordless books. Wordless books focus on making meaning from images ALONE! Here are a few strategies that parents, caregivers and teachers might use while reading a wordless book:
Develop vocabulary to help your children talk about the picture. Consider these terms: line, shape, size, color, space and point of view/perspective. For example, specifically ask your child why an illustrator used a particular color or why certain objects are larger or smaller, or why the illustrator drew the image from a specific point of view. Ask about that white space and why the illustrator chose to add that to the page.
When you come upon a particularly interesting picture in a wordless book, pause. Use these three questions as you look at a page: What do you see? What do you think about what you see? What do you wonder about this image?
Afterward, have your children draw pictures to help them express their response to the image.
There are so many superb wordless picture books, but here are three that will help enhance your child's visual literacy:
"Another" by Christian Robinson is a recently published wordless book that has received starred reviews from many sources. Reviewers have called this book a "work or art and a celebration of childhood." Join the main characters, a little girl and her cat, as they explore another world that seems to be both enchanting and puzzling.
"Wave" by South Korean author/illustrator Suzy Lee offers images of a child protagonist who is investigating the beach for the first time. This book provides extraordinary images for discussion.
"Shadow," also by Lee, provides another opportunity to "read" a story told in just three colors: black, white and yellow. The setting is a dark attic, but it is a lightbulb and the child's imagination that offer an ideal venue to expand your child's visual literacy.
Perhaps Henry David Thoreau provided the best summary for thinking about visual literacy when he wrote, "It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see."

Texto completo: A group hired by T.M. Landry College Preparatory School announced Friday they found no evidence of systemic atmosphere abuse and academic dishonesty at the scandalized Acadiana school, but investigators didn't talk to the people who made those claims.
In a Friday press conference, officials with T.M. Landry released reports concluding an investigation into allegations posed in a Nov. 30 New York Times article.
The article quoted former students and parents claiming school co-founder Michael Landry physically and verbally abused students and that college applications had been doctored. The small school had received national attention for its track record of graduates' acceptance into Ivy League schools.
But those individuals weren't included in the school's investigation by New Orleans law firm Couhig Partners LLC and Paul Pastorek, former Louisiana education superintendent.
Efforts were made to interview them, according to the report, but their attorney "declined to make them available for interviews or provide supporting documents."
"I do not have subpoena power," Pastorek said at a press conference Friday at the LITE Center in Lafayette.
The investigation also did not include interviews with any parents of former or current students.
Current students were interviewed with permission from their guardians, some of whom were present for the interviews with the law firm. The students were transported to and from T.M. Landry by a school employee for the off-site interviews.
Investigators questioned two alumni who had graduated before The New York Times article was published.
"They are in college and doing well and said the article was inconsistent with their experiences," attorney Claire Ponthier said.
From the interviews that were completed the firm concluded the school suffered from poor record-keeping and the overburdening of a small staff rather than systemic efforts to provide false information to colleges.
"Lack of attention to detail in student records and college applications appeared with some frequency," reads the report. "In most cases, the inaccuracies appear to simply be the result of sloppiness and potentially not calculated to provide the students with any distinct advantage."
These inaccuracies include twice mislabeling B-grades as A's, stating a student took a class when he didn't, and inaccurately reporting in college applications that a student was in the top 10 percent of the class.
Pastorek said these were "not material" inaccuracies.
On the question of abuse Also not included in the investigation were police records regarding claims of abuse at the school. Pastorek said law enforcement did not provide any documents or information when requested.
The St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office investigated complaints of students being whipped at T.M. Landry College Prep in 2012.
Michael Landry was cited for simple battery, according to records provided by the sheriff's office to The Advertiser in December.
The Breaux Bridge Police Department received around 10 complaints involving T.M. Landry in the month since The New York Times published its article.
Breaux Bridge Police Chief Rolli Cantu said in December that all complaints had been turned over to Louisiana State Police. An LSP spokesman confirmed.
LSP Trooper Thomas Gossen said Friday there is no new information on the investigation into allegations of abuse at T.M. Landry and that the case is still active and open.
"There is no set time with this or with any investigations," Gossen said in an email.
Without documentation or interviews with claimants, Pastorek said investigators used what was said in The Times article, which gave the impression that physical violence was prevalent at the school.
All of the individuals who were interviewed — current students with parent permission, two alumni and current faculty and staff — described no physical abuse and/or limited corporal punishment in the past.
However, kneeling appears to have been a normalized method of discipline or correction, according to the report. The Times article alleged students were forced to kneel on rice, rocks and hot pavement.
The law firm's investigation describes it only as "kneeling" and states it may have been limited to students whose parents authorized the staff to do so for discipline.
Gina LeBlanc is not one of them. Her daughters, Kayo and Aliko, attended high school at T.M. Landry and now are studying at elite schools on the East Coast.
LeBlanc attended the press conference Friday and said she was the only one disciplining her children. If there was an issue she would come to the school to handle it.
"I'm the disciplinarian," she said. "I'm the momma."
And "if I had a problem with Mike and Tracey (Landry) I went to them," LeBlanc said.
When asked if she had any problems with the school co-founders, LeBlanc said, "Every school has problems."
LeBlanc said she was surprised at the allegations in the national article and said her daughters are succeeding in college, getting all or mostly A's.
Tyler Davis, 13, is in seventh grade at the school and is the grandson of Greg Davis. The former director of the Cajundome and Convention Center assumed the role of chairman of the T.M. Landry board of directors in December.
Tyler likes T.M. Landry and his teachers more than the school he previously attended in West Baton Rouge Parish. He commutes to Lafayette for school.
"It's a good school, nice people," Tyler said. "Before (at my old school) there were not a lot of teachers who really cared. Here they show you more attention and want you to succeed."
The Landrys started the school in their home in 2005 and moved it to a former industrial facility in Breaux Bridge in 2012. They moved to a former skating rink in north Lafayette in March after attempts to bring it up to state fire code.
T.M. Landry College Prep operates as a non-registered, non-approved, non-public school, which is allowed under Louisiana law. Because of its status, the Louisiana Department of Education has no oversight over its operations and is not in a position to investigate allegations against it.
Pastorek said security cameras were put in at the school in 2017 and have been installed at the new Lafayette location.
Enrollment at the school is at 63, down from 110 when the article published, Davis said. The loss of 47 students translates to a loss of at least $243,000 for a school year when using the lowest tuition figures at T.M. Landry — $575 a month for students in pre-K through ninth grade. Tuition increases for older grades up to $725 a month for seniors.
Seventh-grader Tyler Davis and grandfather Greg Davis attend a press conference about T.M. Landry College Preparatory School. The elder Davis is board president for the school.

Texto completo: "A Very Curious Girl" is a very farcical account of sexual revenge.
A one-time staple of women's film festivals that never quite became a classic, this first feature by the Argentine-French director Nelly Kaplan, originally released in the United States in 1970, is back in an excellent 2K digital restoration at the Quad Cinema.
The movie, released in France as "La Fiancée du Pirate" ("The Pirate's Fiancée") is set in the fictional village of Tellier (an allusion to the Guy de Maupassant tale of prostitutes on holiday, adapted in Max Ophul's "Le Plaisir"). Marie (Bernadette Lafont) is a grim-looking servant who, among other indignities, is sexual prey for the men in the village as well as for her female boss (Claire Maurier). After her mother -- reviled as a Gypsy -- is killed by a hit-and-run driver, Marie decides to charge the Tellier locals for the sexual favors hitherto taken from her.
Self-liberated, her look changes. Having applied a cosmetic made from crushed berries and staged a pagan wake for her mother, Marie becomes magically irresistible. In a recent interview with the film journalist Joan Dupont, Kaplan described her protagonist as "a witch who doesn't let herself be burned." Indeed, Marie is a Circe who needn't change her admirers into pigs: They already are.
Marie confidently baffles and humiliates the townspeople at every turn, fleecing some, rejecting others and blackmailing them all. Her seductions and transactions are accompanied by a jaunty song "Moi, je me balance" ("Me, I'm Swinging") written and sung by the celebrated cabaret performer Barbara (Monique Serf). "The bitch has cast a spell on them," one clod complains of the smitten townsfolk. It's a line that Kaplan might have heard in life. Born in Buenos Aires in 1931, she moved to Paris at age 22 where she was welcomed into André Breton's circle of aging surrealists, took up with the venerable filmmaker Abel Gance, and directed a well-received documentary portrait of Pablo Picasso. "A Very Curious Girl" was her declaration of independence.
Lafont, a new wave stalwart who made her screen debut in a short by Francois Truffaut, imbues her character with the implacability of a Brecht protagonist. In his generally favorable review, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that she "plays Marie with a kind of sexless, intellectual wrath, which makes all the fuss about her legendary sensuality even funnier than it might be if she was a steamy teenager." (According to Kaplan, Lafont "really didn't get it, but she was great anyway.")
"A Very Curious Girl" is relentlessly anticlerical as well as anti-bourgeois. Yet as provocatively cartoonish as it is, the film feels closer to the Off Off Broadway spectacles staged by the Playhouse of the Ridiculous in the late 1960s.
While very much of its time, "A Very Curious Girl" remains amazingly fresh after 50 years. Marie's triumph is not just a victory for her sex and class but, given the explicitly xenophobic nature of the smug patriarchal order that she upends, a win for outsiders and outcasts of all varieties.

THE NATION; Trump's Interior nominee is confirmed; David Bernhardt's past lobbying work had raised ethical concerns.

Texto completo: David Bernhardt, President Trump's pick to the lead the Interior Department, was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday amid persistent ethical concerns and doubts about his independence from the energy and water industry groups he long represented as a lobbyist.
Senators voted 56 to 41 in favor of Bernhardt's confirmation. Several Democrats crossed party lines to support the nominee, including Sens. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, also voted for confirmation.
Before becoming acting secretary, Bernhardt spent eight years as a partner in Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, one of the nation's top-grossing law and lobbying firms, according to public rankings. There he represented energy, mining and Western water interests that deal with the Interior Department, including two California entities, Westlands Water District -- the nation's largest irrigation district -- and Cadiz Inc.

Bernhardt's firm sued the department four times on Westlands' behalf. He personally argued one appeals case challenging federal endangered species protections for imperiled salmon. He did legal work for Cadiz, which wants to build a water pipeline on a railroad right of way that crosses federal land in the California desert.
When Bernhardt was confirmed as deputy secretary in 2017, he had to sign the administration's ethics pledge and recuse himself from participating in "particular matters" involving more than two dozen former clients. Some of the recusals were effective for two years, others for one. In the last year, he has helped put policies in place that benefit businesses he once represented as a lobbyist.
Last year, for example, Bernhardt helped craft a Trump directive that would especially benefit Westlands. The directive ordered federal agencies to devise plans to suspend or revise regulations that hamper water deliveries to Central Valley agriculture. An Interior Department spokeswoman said the Westlands recusal had expired by the time Bernhardt took that action.
Bernhardt has won praise from Republicans for opening millions of acres of public land to oil and gas leasing. But Democrats, environmental advocates and some outside ethics watchdogs say his record made him one of the administration's most conflict-riddled Cabinet nominees.
Rep. Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) called Bernhardt "a poster child for the corruption of the Trump administration." Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) has accused Bernhardt of lying and asked the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia this week to investigate whether Bernhardt broke the law by lobbying for a client after he claimed to have stopped.
On Wednesday, 50 House Democrats signed a letter asking senators to oppose Bernhardt's nomination on the grounds that his conflicts of interest and support for regulatory rollbacks should be disqualifying.
So far, Republicans have mostly shrugged off the complaints. Compared with former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who faced ethics investigations into his travel spending and business dealings, Bernhardt's behavior in office has been less conspicuous.
But to critics of lobbyists' influence in Washington, it is no less alarming.
"The corruption we saw from the others has been a stumbling, bumbling type of shilling for private industries," said Huffman, who has sponsored a bill to tighten regulations on former lobbyists. "With David Bernhardt, it's been refined to a high art. He personifies this revolving-door corruption problem."
Citing reporting by the New York Times and a 2017 Los Angeles Times article detailing Bernhardt's previous lobbying activities on behalf of Westlands, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut asked the Interior Department's ethics office in February whether Bernhardt had violated ethics standards when he participated in jump-starting a review of Endangered Species Act protections for fish.
In a recent reply, ethics official Scott de la Vega said Bernhardt had not broken ethics rules because revisions of endangered species protections were much broader than "particular matters," which would include litigation or settlement agreements.
De la Vega's interpretation of the ethics restrictions and the August expiration of remaining recusals suggest that as secretary Bernhardt would have considerable leeway in shaping Interior Department policies that would benefit his former lobbying clients.
Outside advocacy groups that have raised concerns about Bernhardt said they have been ignored or had their complaints rejected.
In 2017, the liberal group Campaign for Accountability filed a complaint with the Department of Justice, asking for an investigation into whether Bernhardt had violated the Lobbying Disclosure Act by continuing to work on behalf of Westlands, despite having formally ended his lobbying activity. According to the group's executive director, Daniel Stevens, it never got a response.
Bernhardt could not have been appointed to an Interior Department post under the Obama administration's ethics pledge, which barred registered lobbyists from taking jobs with an agency they had lobbied within the last two years.
Trump dropped that ban, and his administration's ethics enforcement is not as strict as past administrations, legal experts say.
"I think the Obama administration was more conservative in their interpretation of the ethics pledge," said Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as President George W. Bush's chief ethics lawyer. "And the Obama administration didn't have as many people coming in from the private sector."
Sally Jewell, who served as Interior secretary during President Obama's second term, said in an interview that she took the revolving-door lobbyist ban so seriously that she wouldn't hire a job prospect who wasn't a registered lobbyist but "had done a lot of work and influence on Capitol Hill.... I said, 'I can't. It's too close.'"
"It does feel like we worked very hard to play by the rules," she said. "And we're now at a time where people are looking sort of technically at the words and not necessarily the spirit of the ethics laws."

Here to Help; Five Cheap(ish) Items to Make Your Next Long Flight More Bearable

The difference between an annoying flight and an enjoyable one usually comes down to one's level of preparedness.
For instance, during a long flight, I know I'll be alternately fatigued, cranky and dehydrated. Besides the stress of navigating security lines, layovers and delays, there's the mind-numbing time spent in the air. Hunger makes me grumpy. Twisting in my seat and rifling through my carry-on bag aggravates me.
Heading off those pain points makes all the difference in boosting my mood. I don't step foot on an airplane without a stockpile of snacks and a robust library of podcasts, movies and TV shows downloaded on my tablet. I also make sure to have a few key products at the ready so I can deal with anything -- intrusive noises, boredom, my own funk -- and step off the plane relaxed, hydrated and well rested.
With that in mind, in collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) items to make your next long flight more bearable.
(And if you're looking to load up on the sturdiest travel supplies, read more in Wirecutter's guide to the best gear for traveling.)
Pen
A great pen is one of the most underrated items you can pack for your trip. I'm all for zoning out during a long flight, but after passively listening to an audiobook and watching a few episodes of a Netflix show, you might want to switch gears. Number and word puzzles can engage (and energize) your brain and help pass time when the onboard Wi-Fi is spotty. You might also need to fill out forms or keep track of important information, so a reliable pen is essential.
Wirecutter recommends the Pilot Precise V5 RT. This retractable ballpoint pen writes smoothly, and it's affordable enough that you won't be too bummed if you misplace it during your travels.
Lip balm
Airplane air is notorious for sucking the moisture out of skin, so protect yourself against the inevitable dryness coming your way.
Wirecutter recommends the hydrating Eos Smooth Sphere Lip Balm for most people. It'll keep lips moisturized and the tingly, sweet mint flavor is pleasant enough that both my husband and my 9-year-old niece enjoy using it. It's also available in stick form, which is perfect for stashing in pockets and purses.
Earplugs
Noise-cancelling earbuds are great if you're serious about retreating into a silent cocoon during your flight. However, if you don't mind a little background noise filtering in (and don't want to drop a lot of cash), a pair of foam earplugs will do the job just fine. They'll tamp down children's tantrums and inescapably loud conversations so you can grab needed shut eye.
Wirecutter recommends Mack's Ultra Soft Foam Earplugs because they stay snug in your ear and have a noise reduction rating of 32 decibels. They come in a tub of 50 pairs, so feel free to share.
Eye mask
After the anxiety of catching the flight and boarding the plane, I'm usually ready to take a snooze cruise. Sometimes I drift away easily. Other times I struggle when the person in the seat ahead of me has their window shade up and sunlight is flooding in. Just to be on the safe side, I always keep a sleep mask handy so I can sleep when I need to, not when conditions allow.
Wirecutter recommends the Nidra Deep Rest eye mask for travelers because it's weightless, adjustable and its contoured cups won't put pressure on your eyes.
Toiletry bag
When I flew from New York to Melbourne, Australia, my carry-on toiletry bag was the superstar of the trip. Having my hygiene must-haves -- hand cream, dry shampoo, contact lens case and solution, toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant -- in one convenient place made me feel 100 percent less grouchy during my excruciatingly long 26-hour trip. I'm sure my seatmate appreciated my efforts, too.
Wirecutter's pick is the lightweight, spill-resistant Sea to Summit Travelling Light Hanging Toiletry Bag. If your favorite products don't come in travel-friendly sizes, decant lotions and potions into reusable bottles. Wirecutter recommends the Sea to Summit Travelling Light set which conforms to T.S.A. regulations. It's a smart way to bring a little bit of home wherever you go.

Texto completo: Is Julian Assange a journalist? The Justice Department sidestepped that question in its indictment of Assange. But his case is still certain to stir a debate about whether the WikiLeaks founder deserves protection under the First Amendment.
Assange was arrested in London on Thursday, as U.S. prosecutors unsealed an indictment accusing him of conspiring with Chelsea Manning to hack a Defense Department computer network in 2010 to obtain secret documents that WikiLeaks hoped to publish.
The indictment focuses on Assange's alleged attempt to help Manning crack a password and gain special "administrative-level privileges," an effort that proved unsuccessful. But the underlying "purpose and object of the conspiracy" was "so that WikiLeaks could publicly disseminate the information on its website," prosecutors said.
Assange's supporters describe his arrest and proposed extradition to the United States as an attack on press freedom. But there's some skepticism about that claim, even from several of the country's most prominent defenders of the First Amendment.
"When you read the indictment, it doesn't look like anything that turns on whether Assange is or is not a journalist," said Bruce D. Brown, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in an interview Thursday. "No newsroom lawyer would tell a reporter it's okay to do what's alleged in the complaint - to help a source break a password and hack a computer."
Assange's lawyer Barry Pollack countered that his client deserves to be treated as a journalist. He said in a statement that while the indictment alleges a conspiracy to commit computer crimes, "the factual allegations . . . boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source."
Pollack amplified his comment in an email: "I do not find the question of whether he is a journalist a tricky one. Mr. Assange publishes truthful information that is of public interest. I think that is a pretty good definition of 'journalist.' "
Actually, the federal legal meaning of what constitutes journalism is all but nonexistent. Garrett Epps, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Baltimore, describes it as "a strange twilight zone in terms of the Constitution," because the Supreme Court has never clearly explained who gets the Bill of Rights freedom afforded to "the press."
"The courts haven't extended any protection to journalists that they haven't extended to the public at large," explained Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. "This is in part because extending special protections to journalists would require the court to say who's a journalist and who isn't."
Assange's information-dumping actions make some First Amendment lawyers queasy. "There is a fundamental difference between someone who shines a spotlight on classified information and someone who turns on all the lights," said David Kendall, who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment hearings and Hillary Clinton during the 2016 email investigation.
Because Assange hasn't shown "calibrated judgment" about what information to share with readers, he isn't acting as a journalist, Kendall told me. As for the prosecutors' allegation that Assange facilitated Manning's hacking of classified information, Kendall added: "People in the press typically are not burglars."
Lincoln Caplan, a Yale Law scholar who has written widely about journalism, said in an interview that there's an important distinction between "curating" information, as reporters do, and "dumping" it, as has often been WikiLeaks' practice.
An intriguing footnote to the Assange case is that as part of a failed plea-bargain negotiation with the Justice Department in 2017, he offered to help vet some highly classified CIA files that WikiLeaks was publishing in a document dump known as "Vault 7." As I wrote last September, this "risk mitigation" discussion collapsed after WikiLeaks revealed some especially sensitive CIA hacking techniques.
Assange could argue that the 2017 offer showed he was sensitive to national security concerns. Similarly, he could point to his cooperation with the New York Times and other news organizations that edited and vetted WikiLeaks files before publication.
Complicating this case is WikiLeaks' role in disseminating documents hacked by Russian intelligence from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign, when Assange appeared to be a tool of Russian meddling to support Donald Trump.
Assange wants to fight his case under the banner of press freedom. His problem is that the Justice Department has drawn its indictment carefully enough that the issue is theft of secrets, rather than their publication. That's why so many press advocates seemed to be distancing themselves from Assange after the news broke Thursday.

Texto completo: If some of us ever knew that, they have apparently forgotten. As a result, we have become a nation awash in public lies -- conspiracy theories without basis, crackpot pronouncements from figures of authority, misleading, mendacious misstatements false as a four-dollar bill, delivered every minute of every day to our television, computer and smartphone screens.
Baloney is not free. Still, the price thus far has been borne by a relative few.
It has cost "only" the parent who paid in heartache when some wild-eyed conspiracist claimed that a beloved child killed in a mass shooting never existed and the shooting itself did not happen.
"Only" the African Americans who paid in deepening estrangement as the first black president was pressured into producing his birth certificate to answer baseless claims that he was not born in this country.
"Only" the pizza restaurant patrons who paid in terror as a man with a military-style assault rifle opened fire in hopes of rescuing child sex slaves he had been led to believe were imprisoned there.
But if only a few of us have paid for such baloney thus far, it looks as if the whole country might soon have to ante up.
It seems the United States is grappling with an outbreak of the measles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting last week that there have been 465 cases so far this year.
Officials say the resurgence of the highly contagious, sometimes-fatal disease is driven by the so-called "anti-vax" movement -- parents who refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated because they believe the vaccine causes autism. Which it doesn't. The supposed link between vaccinations and autism stems from a 1998 study by a British doctor. The study was debunked, its findings retracted, the doctor defrocked.
But the baseless fear he raised lives on.
Now we -- actually, our young children -- stand to pay for the baloney he sold. The currency will be fevers, runny noses, coughs, watery eyes and rashes. It could be death.
Is that what it will take to finally bring some of us to their senses? There is, after all, something stark and undeniable about the link between cause and effect here, between anti-vaccination and outbreak.
Maybe that will show some of us how foolish it is to believe absurd untruths without the slightest evidence. Maybe it will remind them how dangerous it is to abandon the obligation of thinking critically. Maybe it will teach them how dumb it is to consider Facebook more authoritative than the CDC or The New York Times.
And maybe it will remind them that the truth doesn't care what you believe, doesn't care what you want or whom you voted for. The truth just is.
To reject that is to reject the connective tissue that makes nationhood possible, to reject any chance of greater good and common cause, to reject the very possibility of us. So this outbreak, troubling as it is, offers a timely chance for some of us to reconsider the choice to live in nonsense.
Because the cost of baloney is high. And it's getting higher all the time.

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Claudio E. Cabrera, a deputy off-platform director tasked with driving quality traffic from search engines to The Times , discussed the tech he's using.
What are the contours of your job, exactly?
I work on S.E.O., which stands for search engine optimization. On a daily basis, my job is not just focused on helping to optimize our stories for greater visibility and increased traffic from search engines such as Google. It's much more.
We have a large newsroom, and we are constantly educating editors, reporters and more on the best practices when it comes to search -- whether it has to do with headlines, URLs, timing or story forms. Additionally, we are teaching them how to spot how well their story is doing on search.
I usually start my day around 6 or 7 a.m. and track everything that happened overnight to get an idea of what to focus on in the morning hours. After that, I start making my rounds on competitive websites and using our trends tools to find potential ideas I can pitch to desks or optimize something correctly that we've already published. I then start jumping into conversations with desk editors about what they have coming for the day that they want me to keep an eye on. I'm big on getting ahead of things, as it gives much more free time to work on strategic initiatives throughout the day.
Outside of the daily news grind, we focus on our coverage for yearly events like the Super Bowl, the State of the Union address and the Oscars; plans for covering other major news events we know are coming; and ways to improve our website on a technological level and expand our reach internationally.
My day usually ends around 5 or 6 p.m. (though I do pop up on our work messaging system at weird hours to make sure we are performing well on the stories we are covering).
How do you keep track of search trends?
A lot of it really starts with taking a dive into the journalism your website is producing. I'm big on looking at our Times Wire tool when I wake up and the stories we've published overnight. I pick and choose what to read based on headlines and jot down anything that stands out. There are always stories within the story, and when we may not catch that story ourselves, another brand will and aggregate it, and it then becomes a trend. That becomes a missed opportunity for us.
On a tools front, I use Google Trends, Kaleida, NewsWhip, Reddit and CrowdTangle. I like these tools because they incorporate search, social and the conversations around them.
Outside of that, it's important to look at whom we consider to be our competitors and what they are doing daily around general news and trending items. It allows me to see what stories we may be missing and what angles we may not be exploring.
Should search trends determine what journalists write about?
I definitely believe search is important and something they should have a solid understanding of -- but it's also not everything.
Digital tools that reporters regularly use to find news, like Dataminr and Google Trends, can't replace the beat reporting and other traditional methods that provide stories that can become trending topics or traffic drivers on both search and social.
But S.E.O. can inform us about what people care about most on a specific beat, both in the short term and the long term. So if there's a breaking news story, you can immediately find out what people are searching for in relation to it and how you want to add it to your coverage. And the statistics that we can extract from tools like Google AdWords and SEMrush can help journalists decide what areas would be best to drill down on further.
In the end, search should be part of a reporter's process, but it shouldn't drive everything.
What tech tools do you use at work?
I have a typical setup in terms of hardware, with a laptop and two screens. One is mostly dedicated to search trends and tracking, while the other is focused on long-term strategy and projects that I can focus on periodically throughout the day.
As far as tools, I am a big Chartbeat user and use it to track performance of how well stories resonate with readers. I also use Slack and have alerts to certain key terms so I can assist in S.E.O.-related conversations outside of being contacted for guidance. (People like to claim I never get off Slack or sleep, but I actually do.)
Google Docs is also my best friend when it comes to keeping track of stories we're watching, working with desks on editorial plans and more. Google Webmaster Tools is important for viewing the overall health of our website. I also use Trisolute, which alerts us when our stories are ranking in search and when they have lost positioning. And I look at SimilarWeb for competitive analysis and SEMrush for keyword analysis. News apps from competing websites keep me in the know about their top stories and general alerts.
Outside of that, I have a portable battery I carry around everywhere to keep my phone charged. I don't want to miss out on anything happening.
What tech do you and your family love to use outside work?
I've never been Mr. Tech and am always made fun of by friends for downloading certain apps late in the game. Recently, I've changed my ways.
I downloaded the Forest app (a friend's recommendation), which helps you defeat phone addiction and use your time in a more efficient way targeted toward your goals. I'm big on reading feature stories over the weekend, so I use Pocket, an app to save long reads. I also use apps like Scribd for books, ClassPass to book workout classes, Sleep Cycle for rest and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's app for getting around the city.
Like most families from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean and Latin America, we communicate a lot through WhatsApp. It's extremely popular in those regions. I have a lot of older relatives who are joining social media for the first time on apps like Instagram and Facebook, so I communicate with them through those tools as well.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Vice President Mike Pence defended his opposition to same-sex marriage in an interview Wednesday in which he also scolded Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg for making comments "critical of my Christian faith and about me personally. "
"He knows better," Pence said in a CNBC interview that aired Thursday. "He knows me. "
Asked by CNBC's Joe Kernen if his position on marriage equality had evolved in the past two decades as public opinion has shifted, Pence said: "My family and I have a view of marriage that’s informed by our faith. "

"And we stand by that," Pence continued. "But that doesn’t mean that we’re critical of anyone else who has a different point of view. "
His comments were the latest development in what Buttigieg, the openly-gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has called his "long and complicated relationship" with the former Indiana governor.
The Democrat and Republican worked together on economic development and other issues in Indiana.
“We had a great working relationship," Pence said on CNBC.
But Buttigieg was a vocal opponent of a "religious freedom" law Pence backed that critics called a license to discriminate against gay people.
As Buttigieg has been exploring a presidential bid that he's expected to make official Sunday, he's frequently criticized Pence and his record on gay rights issues.
In remarks Sunday that received widespread media attention, Buttigieg said he wished the “Mike Pences” of the world would understand that he didn’t choose to be gay.
“That if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator,” Buttigieg said at a fundraising brunch for a group that supports LGBTQ candidates.
After delivering a speech at the United Nations and before the CNBC interview Wednesday, Pence ignored shouted questions from reporters about whether he believes people choose to be gay.
Buttigieg vs. Pence: Tensions flare in 'long and complicated' relationship between Pete Buttigieg and Mike Pence
'A voice from the Christian left': Buttigieg to Pence: If you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is with my creator
Republicans have accused Buttigieg of attacking Pence to raise his own profile, even though he previously had a cordial relationship with Pence.
The vice president, likewise, told Kernan that he understands the Democratic field is crowded and "they're all competing with one another for how much more liberal they are than the other. "
The New York Times reported Wednesday that Buttigieg's attacks "have miffed the vice president, who has privately told allies that if Mr. Buttigieg had questions about his religious beliefs, he could have asked him at any time during their friendship. "
Pence's wife and daughter have also weighed in this week as they've made media appearances promoting their new children's book about the family's pet rabbit.
“It’s perfectly OK for us to believe what we believe. People shouldn’t take that as us attacking what they believe,” Karen Pence said on Fox News Tuesday. “Mike Pence can believe what he believes. And Mayor Pete can believe what he believes. ”
In the children's book that Charlotte Pence wrote and her mother illustrated, the family rabbit visits places in Washington meant to illustrate the meaning of the Pledge of Allegiance. First stop is the Washington National Cathedral, which, the rabbit learns, is a symbol of religious freedom
"I wrote this book before religious liberty was a hot topic," Charlotte Pence said on Fox when asked about Buttigieg's criticisms of her father. "I think it is important for kids to learn at a young age that religious liberty means you can believe in God or you can not believe in God. And you don't have to be afraid to hold that belief. "
Buttigieg, who talks often about his faith on the campaign trail, told reporters Monday that most Christians understand that it's not OK to discriminate against gay people.
"It's time to move on to a more inclusive and more humane vision of faith than what this vice president represents," he said.

Texto completo: Democrats and some in the media expressed shock and outrage when Attorney General William Barr said Wednesday that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.

Barr "must retract his statement immediately or produce specific evidence to back it up," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. "Perpetuating conspiracy theories is beneath the office of the attorney general."

Barr has gone "off the rails," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

"The attorney general must retract his unfounded, irresponsible claim," said Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal.

Cable news commentators called Barr's statement "stunning" and appeared baffled that the attorney general would make such a claim "without evidence."

The baffling thing was why they were baffled. Barr's statement was accurate and supported by publicly-known facts.

First, what Barr said. "I think spying did occur," he told the Senate Appropriations Committee. "But the question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting it was not adequately predicated. But I need to explore that."

That is entirely accurate. It is a fact that in October 2016 the FBI wiretapped Carter Page, who had earlier been a short-term foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. The bureau's application to a secret court for that wiretapping is public. It is heavily redacted but is clearly focused on Page and "the Russian government's attempt to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election." Page was wiretapped because of his connection with the Trump campaign.

Some critics have noted that the wiretap authorization came after Page left the campaign. But the surveillance order allowed authorities to intercept Page's electronic communications both going forward from the day of the order and backward, as well. Investigators could see Page's emails and texts going back to his time in the campaign.

So there is simply no doubt that the FBI wiretapped a Trump campaign figure. Is a wiretap "spying"? It is hard to imagine a practice, whether approved by a court or not, more associated with spying.

That alone is enough to back up Barr's remark. But it is also known that the FBI engaged at least one informant, a professor named Stefan Halper, to penetrate the Trump campaign. The New York Times recently reported that, "Agents involved in the Russia investigation asked Mr. Halper, an American academic who teaches in Britain, to gather information on Mr. Page and George Papadopoulos, another Trump campaign foreign policy adviser."

Halper went beyond Page and Papadopoulos, also contacting and seeking information from Trump campaign aide Sam Clovis. "It was not clear whether Mr. Halper had the FBI's blessing to contact Mr. Clovis," the Times said.

The Halper case is more evidence that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. At least in the cases of Page and Papadopoulos, the information gathering was done by an informant engaged by the FBI.

As to the second part of Barr's statement -- "The question is whether it was adequately predicated," meaning whether the FBI presented evidence sufficient to justify surveillance -- that is something that has been the subject of intense public debate. When the heavily blacked-out Page surveillance application was released -- over the strong objections of the FBI -- there followed a passionate argument over whether the wiretapping was "adequately predicated."

Republicans argued that it was not, because the application was based in part on the Steele dossier, the collection of unverified opposition research allegations compiled by the British spy Christopher Steele on behalf of the Hillary Clinton campaign. Democrats argued that the application was done properly and that the Page surveillance was justified. So, just as Barr said, the question was whether the spying was "adequately predicated."

There has been less public debate over whether the Halper operation was "adequately predicated."

In any event, despite the cries from outraged Democrats and the media analysts who simply can't imagine what Barr might have been referring to, the attorney general's words were demonstrably true.

What does history tell us about 2020? Not very much

Texto completo: What does history tell us about the 2020 presidential election? Not as much as we’d like to know.

We’re an old republic, and our two political parties are the oldest and third-oldest in the world. But we’ve still had only a limited number of presidential elections.

Three were uncontested (1789, 1792, 1820), and six more were conducted under rules significantly different from our current system (legislatures selecting presidential electors, for example). That leaves just 48 elections. And when I was in the polling business, we wouldn’t show any results for subgroups of less than 50 because of the huge statistical margin of error.

And then there is the presidential nominating procedure. There have only been 11 presidential elections in which most national convention delegates have been selected in primaries, and the rules have been different in each election cycle. Plus, the two parties have two different delegate allocation rules. The Republicans tend to favor winner-take-all, and the Democrats prefer proportional representation.

The Democratic field looks to be ballooning to at least 18 candidates with some claim to seriousness, bigger than the Republicans’ 17-candidate field last time. Why so many candidates? Social media deserves some of the credit — or blame. It’s easier than it used to be and much, much quicker to locate and rally possible supporters, and particularly to raise money.

The obverse of this advantage is that your appeal tends to be limited to, or mostly directed at, a category of hyperpolitical people who are not typical of the larger electorate that candidates will face in primaries, let alone the much larger electorate a nominee faces in the general election.

In this era of partisan, polarized politics, hyperpolitical Democrats tend to be highly educated and to be enamored of intersectional identity politics. That’s the gist of a detailed analysis by the New York Times’ Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy. They conclude that the Twitter-happy Left is outnumbered about 2-to-1 among Democratic primary voters by a “more moderate, more diverse and less educated group of Democrats” who may end up nominating “a relatively moderate establishment favorite.”

Cohn is the same writer who, in June 2016, argued that noncollege-graduate whites were a larger share of the electorate than indicated in exit polls and other surveys. That analysis and the extensive interviews by current Washington Examiner columnist Salena Zito, more than any other journalism I can recall, presaged Trump’s surprise victory that November.

One obvious lesson of the Cohn-Quealy thesis is that Democratic candidates shouldn’t be quick to kowtow to the demands of the “woke” Twitterati and take unsustainable positions on the Green New Deal, racial reparations, and Supreme Court packing. But most are already busy doing so.

Another lesson is that Joe Biden, who’s been busily apologizing for his touchy-feely past, already has a bigger potential constituency of moderates than most analysts think. But it’s not nearly as big as it was among Democrats a dozen years ago.

And it won’t be as easy for a Democrat to win this year the way Trump won among Republicans in 2016, by winning a plurality of popular votes in primaries. That’s because Republican winner-take-all rules gave Trump a majority of national convention delegates, while Democrats’ proportional representation rules split the delegates among multiple candidates. In addition, the Democrats have allowed the nation’s largest and second-largest states, California and Texas, to vote early, on March 3.

As the Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman points out, that means that at least 36% of delegates will have been allocated by then and that it’s entirely possible that no candidate will be able to win a majority of delegates before the convention.

Which could mean the first convention second ballot since 1952, at which point the party’s 765 superdelegates (elected and party officials) get votes and presumably will choose the nominee, if they haven’t already done so behind the scene.

Of course, there won’t be any protests or sharp words about that. (Er, just kidding.)

Democrats have reason to blame all this on Trump. If their two current front-runners, Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, are deep into their 70s, Trump was the oldest president to take office. And if multiple candidates with thin credentials are clogging this year’s race, each probably feels he or she more qualified than Trump was.

Whatever your party, it looks like 2020 and 2016 may reinforce my longstanding conviction that the presidential nominating system is the weakest feature of our democratic republican form of government. Sad!

Former UT-Austin tennis coach to plead guilty in college admissions scandal

Texto completo: A former tennis coach at the University of Texas Austin will plead guilty in federal court in Boston on April 24 in connection with the nationwide college admissions cheating scandal, records show.
Michael Center, 54, is scheduled to plead in US District Court in Boston at 2 p.m. that day to a charge alleging conspiracy to commit fraud, according to a notice entered in his case Wednesday.
He's accused of helping an applicant get into UT Austin by falsely designating the student as a tennis recruit. In exchange, he allegedly accepted a $60,000 cash payment for himself and a $40,000 donation to the university's tennis program.
Center faces up to 20 years in prison, but prosecutors will recommend “incarceration at the low end of the Guidelines sentencing range," a $60,000 forfeiture order, and additional fine and restitution payments, his plea agreement says.
Center is one of 50 people charged in the brazen scheme, in which wealthy parents paid bribes to have their children falsely certified as athletic recruits at elite colleges and universities, or to facilitate cheating on their kids' SAT and ACT exams.
Another defendant, former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst, is asking a judge to release funds the government seized when he was arrested so he can pay legal bills expected to surpass $250,000, and living expenses.
On Wednesday, a judge approved the government's request to move a hearing on Ernst's motion from April 17 to April 24.
Prosecutors had said in a court filing Tuesday that “the government team prosecuting this case will be traveling for business for much of the week of April 15, 2019, which would include April 15 through 18, 2019."
The nature of the trip wasn't specified, and a spokeswoman for US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling's office declined to comment.
Federal authorities seized more than $1.1 million from four of Ernst's accounts pursuant to warrants, but Ernst's legal team says prosecutors haven't tied the money to alleged criminal activity.
Ernst is charged with racketeering conspiracy for allegedly collecting bribes totaling $2.7 million over several years in exchange for designating “at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, including some who did not play tennis competitively, thereby facilitating their admission to Georgetown," court records show.
He has pleaded not guilty.
Ernst once gave Michelle Obama tennis lessons and told the New York Times in 2014 that the then-first lady had a powerful backhand.
Additional defendants ensnared in the college bribery investigation dubbed “Operation Varsity Blues" include Hollywood stars Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, as well as captains of industry and prominent financiers.

Reed shrugs off past drama; Defending champion confident despite checkered history; Masters

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Ga. - Golf fans at the Masters are more polite than a teenager getting pulled over by the cops.
They roared for Rory McIlroy after he was nearly disqualified in 2009 over a possible rules violation in a bunker. They cheered for Tiger Woods in 2010 while a plane flew overhead with a banner reading: "TIGER: DID YOU MEAN BOOTYISM?"
It's an easy audience, a just-happy-to-be-here crowd that craves little more than birdies and barbecue sandwiches.
Yet when Patrick Reed won the Masters last year, the gallery around No. 18 responded with yawns and a golf clap. It's as if the spectators forgot that Reed was a Ryder Cup hero nicknamed "Captain America" - or that he led Augusta State, the school down the road, to national championships in 2010 and 2011.
Actually, they knew all too well about Reed's past, which includes accusations of cheating during a college tournament and stealing from teammates at Georgia, his original college, and his estrangement from his family, who live 6 miles from Augusta National but were not welcome on the course.
The crowd instead pulled for Jordan Spieth, who threatened to break the Masters record for greatest Sunday comeback; Rickie Fowler, whose 14-under total fell one shot shy; and McIlroy, who fumbled his chance for a career Grand Slam.
Reed noticed that McIlroy, his playing partner, got a louder ovation when they were introduced on the first tee.
"That played into my hand," Reed said last year on Sunday. "Fueled my fire."
Reed returns to Augusta National this week lighter - yet with similar baggage.
He looks great in his green jacket, having shed a dozen pounds.
"The reason I lost a little is because of tonight," he joked Tuesday, referring to his Champions Dinner menu of ribeye steak and sides such as creamed spinach and mac and cheese. "I need to leave a little room to be able to fit back into it."
But the baggage is such that Reed hasn't won a tournament since leaving the grounds last year. He chose to air some dirty laundry after the United States got thumped in the Ryder Cup, piling on captain Jim Furyk and his downtrodden teammates. And he told the New York Times he "wouldn't at all be surprised" if alienated family members show up to watch him this week.
Reed's security detail asked to have his father, Bill, removed from the 2014 U.S. Open at Pinehurst, with a USGA official telling the Times that Bill's badge was taken away after he made "intimidating movements" toward Reed's wife, Justine. (The Reeds have declined to comment.)
Patrick's father and sister, Hannah, traveled to Paris to watch the Ryder Cup. And they will be allowed on the Augusta National grounds if they choose, as long as they follow the rules of etiquette in the tournament spectator guide: Do not cheer a player's misfortune.
I asked Reed on Tuesday if it's important to him to be well-liked by the Masters spectators.
He sidestepped, saying: "I feel like I have a lot of fans around here. One great thing about the sport we play is that a lot of the fans respect great golf and want to see great golf. ... The more interactive you are with the fans, the more they are going to respect you. At the end of the day, the more the fans get to know you, the more they realize that you're just a normal guy out there playing golf, doing your profession."
Reed, 28, is famously cocky, calling himself "one of the top five players in the world" when he was 23. He had yet to even play in a major.
He rose to 11th in the world rankings after winning the Masters - three spots off his career best - and enters this week 18th.
The odds of him becoming the first defending Masters champion to win since Tiger Woods in 2002 are 50-1, via BetOnline.ag. There are 23 players with a better shot to win, according to the books.
Reed's last four tour results were a tie for 24th in the WGC Match Play, a missed cut at Tampa, a tie for 47th in the Players Championship and a tie for 50th at Bay Hill.
That doesn't bode well. But Reed said it's harder to win a first Masters than a second.
"Once you get over that hurdle," he said, "your confidence goes even higher."

Barr suspects Mueller team 'wanted more put out' in summary

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday he suspects special counsel Robert Mueller's team "wanted more" out of his summary of the final report for the Russia investigation.

"I suspect that they probably wanted more put out," Barr testified during a House Appropriations panel hearing. "But, in my view I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize because I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of being under inclusive or over inclusive but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should wait everything coming out at once."

Days after Mueller submitted his roughly 400-page-long final report to the Justice Department last month, Barr provided a four-page summary to Congress.

This summary said Mueller did not establish the Trump campaign colluded with Russia and did not find President Trump committed obstruction of justice. Although Mueller also did not exonerate the president, Barr said he concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish a crime.

Further adding fuel to their ire were reports last week from the New York Times and Washington Post in which anonymous sources said members of Mueller's team were frustrated with the way Barr portrayed the findings of their years-long investigation in a four-page summary.

Reacting to those reports, Trump tore into Mueller's team on Sunday, accusing the "angry Democrats" of "illegally leaking" information to the media.

Texto completo: En el juicio de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera hubo varias revelaciones sobre la operación del Cártel de Sinaloa, homicidios, traiciones y un largo etcétera, pero hubo temas que no fueron tratados en la Corte de Brooklyn, debido a limitantes que fiscales federales lograron, ya que podrían afectar a sus cooperantes.
También los abogados del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa tuvieron que acceder a que alguna información fuera retenida, como la supuesta compra de menores por parte del mexicano para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas .
Esa historia se hizo pública a pocos días de que el juicio terminara, lo que incluso desató una polémica con los miembros del jurado, quienes afirmaron no haber leído al respecto en internet, debido a que una de las reglas que se les impuso era no buscar historias sobre Guzmán Loera en redes sociales o cualquier página en la web.
Tras una batalla legal de abogados de VICE News y del New York Times, algunos documentos serán liberados, como uno hecho público hace unos días, donde se indica que Alex Cifuentes , ubicado como W1 (Testigo 1) era un testigo complicado, debido a sus creencias y práticas esotéricas.
Cifuentes, quien vivió con Guzmán Loera en las montañas de Sinaloa, creía en la brujería, además de tener “creencias poco ortodoxas “, innecesarias para el caso, consideraron los fiscales.
El colombiano, quien acusó que su exsocio pagó $100 millones de dólares al expresidente Enrique Peña Nieto , podría haber sido descalificado también por creer en los extraterrestres y de que habría un apocalipsis en el 2012 .
También creía en los Illuminati, la masonería y otras teorías de conspiración que afectarían su testimonio ante el jurado y la opinión pública, ya que fue quien reveló el estilo de vida de Guzmán Loera, cómo escapó de las montañas, explicó su círculo de seguridad, los negocios de drogas con socios de Colombia y Ecuados y la apertura de nuevos mercados, como el de Canadá.

Texto completo: Though neither Joe nor Everlyn Bryant knew it the day they met in the late '70s, while working on the railroad in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, the future husband and wife had both grown up farming.
Joe Bryant Jr., now 78, had come of age farming with his dad, on land the family owned or leased, from the time he was 16 until he graduated from college. Joe Jr. then taught agriculture classes before going to work for the railroad.
Everlyn, meanwhile, had started farm work much younger, as a 10-year-old member of a family of laborers who neither owned nor leased land. Unlike her brothers and sisters, 71-year-old Everlyn said, "I always loved farming, even when I was chopping and picking cotton."
Where Joe Jr. grew up dedicated to his family-owned farm, Everlyn credits farm work with instilling her sense of determination. "That was the making of who I am," she said of her youth in the fields and early exposure to exploitation. "When I was growing up and seeing those things happen, I was like, 'That's not gonna be me.' "
Decades later, the couple had grown Joe Sr.'s farm from 250 acres to 2,500 — a scale of operation that only 1% of black farm operators reach, according to the most recently available Census of Agriculture figures.
But five years ago, the family faced a financial crisis after two consecutive years of farming soybeans that they say produced an inexplicably small yield, though the Stine Seed Co. seeds they purchased were synonymous with quality.
Unable to make their mortgage payment, the Bryants said they sold or stopped leasing more than 1,500 acres of land in 2014.
The problem with their yield, the Bryants say, is that the seeds they received were not the high-quality Stine seeds they ordered. And, the Bryants are not the only ones to make that claim, as of a federal civil suit filed in April 2018 against Stine and certain employees and affiliates.
Pitting a collaborative of five black farmers from Tennessee and Mississippi against Stine — a privately held company that Bloomberg valued at $2.9 billion in 2016 — a legal battle has been waging over soybean seeds a Stine representative sold the farmers, whose suit alleges fraud and discrimination. After meeting the representative at a trade show in Memphis in 2017, the farmers ordered certified, genetically modified Stine seeds but were instead given an inferior substitute, they allege.
Since news of the suit first made a splash in July 2018, the Iowa-based company has asserted the farmers' allegations have no merit. In a statement, company President Myron Stine vowed to fight for the suit's dismissal, while "continuing to serve all our customers with the highest degree of integrity and respect." Stine describes itself as the largest independent seed producer in the nation.
"I'm amazed when I sit in court and listen to Stine, and they don't want to take any responsibility," Everlyn said.
Low yields The pair married in 1979 and soon returned to farming full time. As the farm grew, Joe Jr.'s son from a previous marriage, Joe Bryant III — who goes by Joe Three — grew up alongside it, able to run a combine harvester from the time he was 12.
From 2010 to 2011, the farm took the hit that forced the family to sell hundreds of acres. Their soybean fields yielded 10 bushels per acre, instead of the previous yield of 40 bushels per acre, the younger Joe Bryant declared in a sworn statement.
The Bryants say the only thing different were the seeds used, purchased from Bryan Cornelius, a local sales representative for Stine, who declined to comment.
"I'm still farming. I never had it happen to me again and never before," said Joe Three, now 52 years old. "I did everything I was supposed to do. And then you're like, well, what did I do wrong?"
That question dissipated with the news of the lawsuit against Stine, filed by farmers affiliated with the Memphis-based Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association, one of three distinct, multi-state organizations that support black farmers.
The details of the case resonated with the Bryants. One farmer said that the fields in Mississippi, where he planted the Stine seeds, yielded 24 to 25 bushels per acre, whereas fields where he planted a different soybean seed yielded approximately 48 bushels per acre. Another farmer said that some of his Stine fields yielded 35 bushels per acre or less — but in one 120-acre field, the yield was as low as 5 bushels per acre, the lawsuit alleges.
The Stine soybean suit When Joe Three attempted to join the suit, a lawyer for Stine filed an opposing motion, writing, "Mr. Bryant's allegations have nothing in common with Plaintiff's implausible seed-swapping scheme allegations."
Since President Myron Stine's initial statement, the company has decried the suit as baseless. "Stine takes seriously any allegations of unlawful, improper, or discriminatory conduct and is disturbed by the baseless allegations leveled against the company. Upon learning of these claims, the company took swift action to conduct an internal investigation, which has not revealed any evidence that would support these allegations," Stine wrote in a July 2018 statement.
In their complaint, the farmers highlight the results of a germination test performed by the Mississippi Department of Agriculture on seeds they submitted, which, at zero percent germination, did not match the germination rate of the certified seeds ordered. They also argued that the reluctance of a Stine agronomist to take samples from their fields for testing, while visiting the farm and remarking on their "yield problem," was suspect.
Those points remain unaddressed by lawyers for Stine because they were granted a motion extending the amount of time in which they were required to file an answer. The parties were since ordered into mediation and agreed to cease commenting on the case in the final weeks of talks.
Before that, the president of the Memphis farmers group, Thomas Burrell, said compensation was a matter of survival. "Farming is like any other business. Having inferior seeds guarantees that you're gonna lose," he said. And when yields are low, Burrell said, "you won't be able to service the debt for that $300,000 tractor. You won't be able to pay the rent."
When mediation was ordered, Burrell hailed the development as "one more step forward," referencing a historic class-action lawsuit filed by black farmers in 1999 that saw the U.S. Department of Agriculture admit discrimination and pay the largest settlement in U.S. history.
Burrell's related efforts have been highlighted by the media and subjected to scrutiny. A 2013 report by The New York Times, which does not attribute the source of its information regarding Burrell, states he solicited fees in exchange for help with discrimination claims. People who had not necessarily farmed and would no longer be eligible for a settlement, given filing deadlines, were encouraged to file, the report said.
In a case that sought to change eligibility limits, Burrell's group recently lost its appeal. "The association could not fight cases unless their members pay dues for the association to hire attorneys," Patricia Rogers, spokeswoman for the group, said, adding that dues also pay for an office and staff. Burrell was not available amid mediation, she said.
Restitution Everlyn retired from farm life in 2013, and Joe Three says he'd soon like to pass the baton to his son.
For the sake of future farmers, Everlyn hopes the case results in some form of accountability. "No farmer, black or white, should have to go through this," she said. "We bought them in good faith and was hoping that it would produce a good crop," Everlyn said of the seeds. "We'll deal with it if they don't make any restitution at all. But we hope that they do."
Five years ago, the Bryants faced a financial crisis after two consecutive years of farming soybeans that they say produced an inexplicably small yield.

Texto completo: The New Hampshire House and Senate have both approved legislation that would gradually raise the state’s minimum wage above the woefully inadequate federal standard of $7.25 per hour, which has not increased since 2009 even as prices have increased by about 17 percent. Assuming that the two chambers, both controlled by Democrats, work out the differences between their two bills, the legislation would advance to the desk of Gov. Chris Sununu, who, according to The Press, has indicated that he does not support decoupling New Hampshire from the federal minimum wage. That presumably means a veto is in the offing.
We hope the governor will reconsider, because few things have a more positive effect on the lives of the working poor than a minimum wage that truly helps make ends meet. Other states and cities around the country have begun to recognize this. At least 10 big cities and seven states have enacted minimum wages in the $12 to $15 range, and dozens of smaller cities and counties have followed suit. The current minimum in Vermont is $10.78 an hour, and pending legislation seeks to raise it to $15 an hour by 2024.
In New Hampshire, the Senate version would raise the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2020 and $11 or $12 an hour the following year, depending on what benefits employers provide. The House bill would set the minimum wage at $9.50 in 2020, $10.75 in 2021 and $12 in 2022. For context, even at $12 an hour, employees working a 40-hour week would gross just $480 a week, or $24,960 a year, while those working 60 hours would earn $720, or $37,440 a year. Readers who make, say, two or three times the minimum wage are invited to examine their own household budgets to see how far those wages would actually go.
Two objections are often offered to raising the minimum wage in New Hampshire. One is that virtually everyone is paid more than the minimum at present, so no reason exists to increase the legal minimum above the federal level. (A bill pending in Congress would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 over five years, but is unlikely to be enacted given Republican opposition.) If this assertion about New Hampshire employment is true, then raising the minimum wage should have little to no impact on employers.
The second objection was articulated by the state Senate’s Republican leader, Chuck Morse of Salem, who contended that states and cities that have raised their minimum wage have experienced a decline in jobs and a decrease in take-home pay for low-wage workers because of reduced hours of employment. Indeed, a 2017 University of Washington study of Seattle’s experience found just such an effect.
However, a number of other studies looking more broadly at the minimum wage picture have found little negative impact on employment and significant positive impact on earnings. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, last year analyzed the effects of a higher minimum wage on the food service industry in six early-adopting cities: Chicago, Washington, D.C., Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle. Using two different models, they concluded that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage boosts earnings between 1.3 and 2.5 percent, while the impact on jobs of such an increase ranged, on average, from an estimated 0.3 percent decrease to a 1.1 percent increase. Similarly, researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst looked at the impact on all low-wage jobs of 100 state-level increases in the minimum wage since 1979. They concluded that low-wage workers saw a wage gain of 7 percent, but little change in employment.
It’s also worth noting that big private employers apparently are coming around to the view that a higher minimum benefits all, especially in an exceptionally tight labor market. Amazon, for example, announced last October that it would raise the minimum pay for all its United States employees to $15 an hour; Target has said its minimum wage would rise to $15 by 2020; and Costco has raised its minimum to $14 an hour. At the end of last month, McDonald’s, for many years a leading low-wage employer, announced that it would no longer lobby against minimum wage increases at the federal, state or local level. (To be fair, critics pointed out that more than 90 percent of its restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent franchisees, who presumably would bear the brunt of minimum wage increases.)
Compelling as they are, the economic arguments are not the only ones in favor of increasing the minimum wage. Matthew Desmond, a professor of sociology at Princeton, covered some of them in The New York Times Magazine in February. He noted that a number of studies around the country have focused on the public health effects associated with increased minimum wages, which include decreased rates of smoking and child neglect, increased utilization of health care, and decreases in low birth-weight babies and teen births. Given the continuing struggles that afflict New Hampshire’s child welfare agency, the associated decrease in child neglect should be of particular interest to state officials.
Something less tangible is also in play in raising the minimum wage. If there is dignity to be found in work — and we believe that there is — being compensated fairly is key to an employee’s self-respect. Many low-wage workers take just as much pride in their work as do people who earn 10 or 20 times the minimum. They deserve compensation that reflects the value of what they do.

New York Times: The secret death toll of America's drones

Texto completo: The Pentagon says American airstrikes in Somalia have killed no civilians since President Trump accelerated attacks against Shabab militants there two years ago.
Amnesty International investigated five of the more than 100 strikes carried out in Somalia since 2017 by drones and manned aircraft, and in just that small sampling found that at least 14 civilians were killed.
The Pentagon says airstrikes by the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State killed at least 1,257 civilians in Iraq and Syria as of the end of January.
Airwars, a university-based monitoring group, estimates that those strikes killed at least 7,500 civilians in those countries.
Those disparities show how poorly the American public understands the human cost of an air war fought largely by remote-controlled drones. Drones have been the main weapon in the counterterrorism fight for more than a decade. They kill extremists without risking American lives, making combat seem antiseptic on the home front. But the number of civilians killed in these attacks is shrouded in secrecy.
President Donald Trump has made it even harder to lift that shroud, by allowing the Central Intelligence Agency to keep secret how many civilians are killed in the agency's airstrikes outside of the Afghan, Iraqi and Syrian war zones - in places like Yemen, the lawless border region of Pakistan and North Africa.
President Barack Obama aggressively expanded drone use in these airstrikes. But he eventually came to understand the need for more transparency and accountability, and, under pressure, he put some sensible safeguards in place.
Among them was a July 2016 order requiring the government to issue annual public reports on the civilian death tolls in those areas.
Trump revoked that order this month. His National Security Council called it superfluous because Congress had subsequently passed a law mandating that the Pentagon publicly report any civilians killed in any of its operations. But that law covered only the Pentagon, not the separate C.I.A. drone campaign, which has broadened under Trump.
Experts say that, under President Trump, airstrikes have surged in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, as well as in Somalia. In Yemen, it is unclear to what extent the Americans, as opposed to the Saudi-Emirati coalition, are responsible. In Afghanistan, the number of American strikes that killed or injured civilians more than doubled in the first nine months of 2018 compared with the corresponding period in the previous year and killed more than 150 civilians, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.
Trump has also eroded constraints on civilian casualties.
Since taking office, he has rescinded rules that required the military and the C.I.A. operating outside of hot battlefields like Afghanistan and Iraq to limit their targets to high-level militants rather than foot soldiers. He also, by eliminating an elaborate interagency approval process, gave military commanders more authority to order drone strikes.
Yet, even under the previous rules, no matter how precise the weapons, how careful the planners and how skilled the fighters, mistakes, faulty intelligence, even calculated decisions often led to civilians being killed. The official data ranges from none to maddeningly vague, and the safeguards to mitigate civilian deaths are insufficient.
The military adopted an elaborate system under the Obama administration to minimize civilian casualties, including a requirement that forces have "near certainty that no civilian will be harmed before launching an attack. But reporting by The Times and others in 2017 showed that the Pentagon had killed far more civilians in Iraq than it acknowledged.
The Obama administration estimated that over its two terms drone strikes had killed between 64 and 116 civilians in 542 airstrikes outside the major war zones. Micah Zenko, co-author of a new book, "Clear and Present Safety, calculated the real tally at roughly 324.
Drones, for all their faults, are less indiscriminate than B-52s or almost any other weapon. But they are also a seductive tool, potentially tempting presidents and military commanders to inflict grave damage without sufficient forethought.
A lack of transparency and accountability for civilian deaths helps enemies spin false narratives, makes it harder for allies to defend American actions and sets a bad example for other countries that are rapidly adding drones to their arsenals. It could also result in war crimes, as some critics have claimed.
Congress needs to insist on better data as the Pentagon inspector general investigates civilian casualty reporting.
There is no such thing as combat without risk. With drone combat, much of the risk falls on innocents. Americans need to understand the full cost and consequences of those risks.

Unfortunately, the creative wonder we experience as small children often declines in each subsequent year as we confront the world's difficulties. It's been said that we begin school with a colorful set of crayons but we graduate with a single, blue ballpoint pen.
Ironically, it is the creative problem solving, collaboration and unbridled imagination of kindergarten that create the most success in business and life. Conversely, rigid and fear-based approaches seldom yield the results we seek. Especially in these fast-moving and competitive times, human creativity is one of the most powerful — and often underutilized —resource at our disposal.
MIT professor and author Mitchel Resnick runs a program called Lifelong Kindergarten to combat the typical, restrictive forces in our society. His premise is that the core principles of kindergarten — projects, passion, peers and play — are the components that yield profound inventions and solve our most pressing challenges.
We already see the crushing impact that most corporate cultures have on creativity. Leaders hire talented people for their imagination and judgment, yet seldom allow those skills to surface in daily work. Simply put, beige cubes, restrictive policies and fear-based cultures inhibit sustainable success.
Instead, what if we embraced Resnick's philosophy of Lifelong Kindergarten? Encouraging all ideas, even the wacky ones. Solving complex problems in unorthodox ways. Fostering a safe environment of experimentation and collaboration.
In our turbulent business client, we won't find predictable growth by sitting politely at our desks, and filling out forms with a No. 2 pencil. As a modern alternative, let's foster Resnick's 4 P's — project-based work and learning; cultivating passion for the work; collaborative co-creation with diverse peers; and using play to discover breakthroughs.
If we want to win at the highest levels, we must ditch the military-school vibe of Corporate America and shift to the creative wonder we enjoyed as young learners. If we want to enjoy lifelong prosperity, let's embrace the Resnick's notion of Lifelong Kindergarten, and play (not work) our way to success.
Your colorful crayons are calling.

Texto completo: I love survival stories. Perhaps because of my own aversion to risk yes, I check the stove twice before going to bed I am drawn to stories of people who have been exposed to extreme risk either by choice or circumstance. I can relate to the movie "Everest," which tells the story of eight relatively "normal" people from ordinary walks of life who tried to summit the Himalayan mountain in 1996 with the help of a professional guide. Four of them along with four others died on that fateful day because of inexperience and bad decisions.
I cannot relate to the film "Free Solo," which documents the extraordinarily "abnormal" Alex Honnold who climbed El Capitan, a 3,200-foot granite 00 1 wall in Yosemite National Park in California, without ropes. His ascension of El Capitan without regard to his personal safety was characterized by the New York Times as "one of the great athletic feats of any kind, ever."
With this attraction to survival stories, I perused the shelves of the outdoor adventure section of a bookstore and came across "Deep Survival," by Laurence Gonzales, a life-long student of survival stories and expert on survival skills. Attracted by the title, I thought I was in for a treat of great tales of survival. Instead, Gonzales instructs the reader about the psychology behind survival, while mixing in an accounting of some rather spectacular successes and failures.
Gonzales explains that the part of our brain that first receives reports of danger and fear is the amygdala. The amygdala processes the stimuli and emotionally prepares us for action, whether that's fight or flight, without much consultation with the rational part of our brain. That's why casual outdoor recreationalists, when confronted with danger without proper training, do things that get them further in trouble. Honnald, a superbly trained athlete, was found not to have much reaction to dangerous stimuli in his amygdala during a CAT scan. Go figure.
With my aversion to risk, you will not find me summiting Everest or hanging 3,000 feet above the ground without a rope. You will find me backpacking into the wilderness of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. My friend and I ventured into the Porcupine Mountains to test our survival skills and also our social skills while confined to a two-man tent during a 12-hour rainstorm.
Yet survival skills have more application than on the trail or on a mountain. We can apply them in our everyday lives and in overall society.
The amygdala not only processes stimuli from fear and danger. It also triggers the flames of anger.
An aggressive move from an adjacent driver, a thoughtless comment from a politician, a nonsensical statement by a columnist, or a provoking post on social media, all get sent to the amygdala for reaction. The response, driven by emotion, is often equally aggressive, thought-less, nonsensical and provoking. And that's just for starters.
A better first step might be: Whoa! What just happened? The sooner the intellect overrides the amygdala, the better the outcome. Emotional responses get us lost in the wilderness and misled in society. Anger is helpful as a motivator, but useless as a plan. It entrenches adversaries and ends communication. Moreover, it sullies our reason.
Gonzales points out that people lost or injured in the wild who rely solely on emotion make bad decisions. Anger arises from blaming others for your predicament. Why didn't my hiking companion pack a survival kit? Why didn't my boating companions let someone know our route? Why did I let them talk me into this?
The most important step for those who survive is to realize no one can help them but themselves. Survivors take complete responsibility for their survival. Gonzales suggests that survivors also find motivation in getting back to loved ones, a connection to needs larger than themselves.
Whether lost in the wild or in the world: We can't change our predicament. We can't change others. We can only change ourselves if not for ourselves, then for the greater needs of family and society. We don't need to step foot on a mountain to learn that lesson. CREDIT: ERIC FRYDENLUND

Beard's legacy at Texas Tech started under Bobby Knight

Texto completo: When Bobby Knight took over as Texas Tech basketball coach in 2001, the Red Raiders had won only three NCAA tournament game since 1962 and had reached the tournament only six times in that stretch.
One of the first assistant coaches Knight hired was Chris Beard, the head coach at Seminole State Junior College. He remained an assistant at the school through 2011 under Knight and Pat Knight, who replaced his father when he retired in 2008.
Knight ended up coaching part of seven years with Texas Tech, and Beard was on the staff the entire time. They took the school to four NCAA tournaments, including a Sweet 16 run in 2004-05. I was at all of those tournament games with Knight, who has long been a close personal friend.
"Yeah, I enjoyed what I was doing when I coached at Texas Tech," Knight said this week from Bloomington, Ind. "It was an interesting situation and one we did pretty well at."
While Knight didn't have the same success he had at Indiana -- a 662-239 record (.735) and three NCAA championships in 29 years -- his .627 winning percentage was the best in Texas Tech history, with a 138-82 record.
That winning percentage has since been eclipsed by Beard (75-30, .714), who took over as head coach in 2016 and has the school in the Final Four for the first time in program history this weekend at U.S. Bank Stadium.
"I had [Beard] as an assistant coach for a while," Knight recalled. "He worked hard. He learned that defense is how you win. I think he really paid attention and worked hard at learning to coach."
Pat Knight recalled how Beard first came to be at Texas Tech in a story appearing in the Las Vegas Review Journal: "Dad called me and said, 'I found this kid and I think he would be great for us. He's got everything we need.' "
In the lead-up to the Final Four, Beard talked about his relationship with Knight.
"I have heard back from several people that he sent his congratulations," Beard said. "As always, Coach has been very supportive. He's really been great the past three years since I've been back to Lubbock."
When Beard returned to Texas Tech, he took over for former Gophers coach Tubby Smith, who coached there from 2013-16 before taking over at Memphis.
Beard said of Smith: "We inherited a good situation. Tubby Smith had gotten Texas Tech back to the NCAA tournament [in 2015-16]. When we walked into Tech, there was a culture of defense, there was a culture of accountability."
Defense-minded
Knight said that when he hired Beard, he knew the young assistant was going to be a strong defensive coach.
"He had to be good with the defense," said Knight, who is in both the Basketball Hall of Fame (inducted in 1991) and the College Basketball Hall of Fame (2006). "You know, you do not win as he is winning without playing good defensively."
There is no doubt about Beard's ability to coach defense. Ken Pomeroy's statistics at kenpom.com rank Texas Tech as the No. 1 defensive team in the country. It was No. 4 last year when Beard took Texas Tech to the Elite Eight.
"He worked hard at it, he learned how to coach and that is what he did," Knight said. "He understood what was important in this thing. He did pretty well for himself."
Does Knight, who coached in five Final Fours and won three, think Beard has a chance to win the tournament?
"Oh, how would I know?" he said with a laugh. "He has gotten there, so I would think that he would be pretty tough to play against."
Huge coaching tree
A headline in the New York Post this week read: "The Bobby Knight disciple who has Texas Tech in the Final Four."
Yes, everyone thought Mike Krzyzewski, another former Knight assistant coach at Army, was going to have the best chance at a national title. But after Duke's 68-67 loss to Michigan State in the East Region final, Beard will be the lone Knight disciple in the Final Four.
Beard is only one of a long line of coaches who have studied and coached under Knight, including Krzyzewski, Mike Davis, Jim Crews, Bob Donewald, Dave Bliss, Bob Weltlich, Royce Waltman, Don DeVoe and Murry Bartow.
That list doesn't include former players of Knight who also have had great coaching careers, such as Steve Alford, Randy Wittman and Mike Woodson.
Every time Krzyzewski was either involved in a Final Four or appearing as a guest, I spent time around him and got to be a close personal friend of his through Knight.
And for those who say the two great coaches don't have a good relationship, that isn't the case.
Knight introduced Krzyzewski when he was inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2001. And when Krzyzewski passed Knight's 902 career victories for the most wins in Division I college basketball history in 2011, Knight was there.
The New York Times reported at the time that Krzyzewski told Knight, "I know a lot of people don't tell you this, Coach, but I love you."
That's long been Knight's legacy, a tough but important figure in a lot of players' and coaches' lives. There's no doubt Beard feels the same way.
Knight said that when it comes to his relationship with NCAA basketball these days, it's a lot less stressful as he and his wife, Karen, spend a lot of time traveling and going out to dinner.
"I am still around, but I don't pay attention to anything," Knight said. "I don't have to win any games. I don't have to coach. We just have to take it easy."

Austin Opera goes intimate with powerful

Texto completo: “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” says Annie Burridge, general director of Austin Opera, about “Soldier Songs,” which plays Friday and Saturday at the Paramount Theatre. “You hear these stunning arias in the final scenes. A veteran sees uniformed men coming to his door to say that his son has died in combat. He wants to set his car on fire. Over and over, he sings: ‘Bring me back my son!’ In a way, the opera being only an hour long is a blessing because of the intensity.”
A visceral show with rock-infused and minimalist music that transports the audience into combat, “Soldier Songs” — coming right on the heels of Austin Opera’s smashing version of “Silent Night,” another new opera, this one
about a brief World War I truce — is the first project out of the gate for “Opera ATX,” Burridge’s effort to expand her group’s footprint outside of the Long Center for the Performing Arts.
Composed by David T. Little, it stars David Adam Moore as the solo performer, in an immersive production wrapped in projections and amplifications, then packaged for the road by producer Beth Morrison.
“We wanted to get Opera ATX out quickly,” Burridge says. “And Beth Morrison Projects had a production of ‘Soldier Songs’ that we could pick up and drop into the Paramount. That allowed us to launch the initiative sooner.”
“Soldier Songs,” based on interviews Little conducted with family members and friends who had served in multiple wars, was tested for smaller-than-usual venues in Houston and has played New York, Los Angeles, San Diego and Atlanta, among other markets.
“I encountered Little’s work in Philadelphia,” Burridge says of her previous home operatic base, where Little also served as composer in residence. “We did a workshop for ‘JFK,’ which premiered at Fort Worth. Then we did a presentation of part of David’s opera “Dog Days.” During both experiences I felt I had been punched in the gut.”
The critics, too, have paved the way for the rapid advance of “Soldier Songs” across the country.
“At once seductive and repulsive, the presentation provided further evidence of Little’s fast-rising stock as a vital theatrical creator,” wrote Steve Smith for the New York Times. “Little also alludes to mass-media saturation; a virtual-reality distancing between a soldier’s actions and their results; and jingoistic longing for military dominance. At several points he uses the actual recorded voices of veterans: notably, both female and male.”
“David T. Little’s opera ‘Soldier Songs’ should be required viewing for anybody who has not seen active service,” wrote Jill Steinberg for Opera News. “The harrowing middle section employs both martial riffs and visceral, heavy-metal-infused beats. A moaning cello expresses the father’s anguish until it surrenders into an uneasy contrapuntal truce with a fife and drum tattoo.”
“There were no supertitles, but none were necessary,” wrote Joanne Syndey Lessner in the Los Angeles Times. “With (David Adam) Moore as our increasingly tortured and isolated guide, we could always feel where we were in his journey from innocence to the consequences of real-world horror.”
The audience will be invited to stick around after both performances to discuss, among other things, the ongoing effects of post-traumatic stress disorder. Such a discussion should be easier in the Paramount — no one will be seated in the upper balconies for the performances — than at the Long Center’s Dell Hall because of the comparative intimacy.
Another of the advantages of smaller venues: Producing at the Paramount costs 80 percent less than at the Long Center. Austin Opera plans to announce its next Opera ATX project at Saturday’s performance of “Soldier Songs.”

Schumer Pushes Climate Change Awareness to Communities of Color

Texto completo: The latest Climate Perspectives Survey by ecoAmerica has found mat African Americans and Latinos express the strongest concerns about climate change, report the highest levels of personal and health impacts from climate change, and report notably higher levels of civic engagement and personal action on climate than the national average.
Experts said the MacArdiur-sup-ported survey underscores the importance of engaging Latinos and African Americans on climate as key constituencies who support and can help advance climate solutions.
Senate Minority Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has pushed for more awareness to climate change and has focused on its effects on African Americans and other minorities.
Recently Schumer outlined the new strategy in an interview, casting it as a way to mobilize millennial voters, a key part of the Democratic constituency that the party will need to turn out to win in swing states.
With progressives pushing Democrats to embrace the Green New Deal - and Republicans ridiculing the idea as socialism - Schumer is effectively trying to turn a weakness into a strength, according to his interview with the New York Times.
His office said Schumer plans daily floor speeches attacking Republicans for inaction and a proposal for a special Senate committee focused on the issue.
And while there is virtually no chance of passing climate change legislation in a Republican-controlled Senate with President Trump in office, Schumer reportedly said he wanted legislation to run on next year - and bring to a vote in early 2021, should his party win the White House and the Senate.
"This is the first time Democrats have decided to go on offense on climate change," Schumer told the New York Times.
Asked about a bill, though, he conceded that "it's going to take us a little while to come up with a consensus that works."
Schumer wants Democrats to run more aggressively in favor of climate change policies going into 2020, although he conceded in his interview with The New York Times earlier this month that the exact legislative form that will take is still up for debate.
"It's going to take us a little while to come up with a consensus that works," he said.
Additionally, African Americans, along with Latinos, have higher rates of "Climate awareness and concern."
One recent study states that people of color are more likely to be exposed to air pollution - a sentiment echoed by the NAACP.
According to the NAACP's 2012 "Coal-Blooded" study, "communities of color are more likely to breathe in polluted air. Communities of color breathe in 40 percent more polluted air than white communities across the U.S."
In a "Fume across the Fence-Line report," The NAACP noted that "more than 1 million African Americans live within a half-mile of existing natural gas facilities and the number is growing every year. As a result, many African American communities face an elevated risk of cancer due to air toxics emissions from natural gas development.
NAACP's Environmental and Climate Justice Program revealed that "Race is the number one indicator for the placement of toxic facilities in the country."
Additionally, the NAACP study found diat more African Americans live near nuclear, coal, or biomass power plants than any other demographic group in the United States, more than any other demographic in the country.
The same report states "People of color have historically been relegated to living in lower, flood-prone areas that are also vulnerable to flooding during extreme weather events and to sea level rise."
Schumer said he'll continue to lead efforts toward better conditions.
"I'm going to keep fighting until Congress and America take strong, serious action," the senator tweeted this week.

Texto completo: Unhealthy diets dominated by sugar, salt and trans fats were associated with one in five deaths and were more deadly than tobacco and high blood pressure, a new study says.
Results of the study, published Wednesday in the British journal The Lancet, were reported in the New York Times and other media outlets.
New York Post Twitter post on diet study
The globally-focused study is considered one of the largest of its kind.
Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the study covered eating habits in 15 categories including fiber, processed meat, milk, seafood and sodium from 1990 to 2017.
"...researchers found that consuming vegetables, fruit, fish and whole grains was strongly associated with a longer life -- and that people who skimped on such healthy foods were more likely to die before their time," according to the analysis of the study by the Times.
CBS reported: "Poor dietary habits, which is a combination of high intake of unhealthy foods, such as red meat, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages and a low intake of healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, and seeds, overall causes more deaths than any other risk factors globally," study author Dr. Ashkan Afshin, an assistant professor of Health Metrics Sciences at the University of Washington, told CBS News.
In 2017, of about 11 million deaths that could have been avoided, around 10 million were caused by cardiovascular disease, according to the study. Cancer came in as the second largest diet-related killer with 913,000 deaths, followed by Type 2 diabetes.
"These numbers are really striking," said Dr. Francesco Branca in the Times article. He is a top nutritionist at the World Health Organization, who was not involved in the study. "This should be a wake-up call for the world," he said.

Trump pushes two flunkeys for the Fed

Texto completo: President Trump reshaped the Supreme Court with the appointment of two very qualified, very conservative jurists. Now he's taking on the Federal Reserve, but his latest picks sorely lack the experience and skills needed for the job.
After three fairly conventional nominations to the Fed — Randal Quarles, Richard Clarida, and Michelle Bowman — Trump has apparently settled on two men who seem eminently unsuited to having the fate of our nearly $22 trillion economy in their hands.
On Thursday, several news organizations reported that the president plans to nominate Herman Cain, the one-time pizza company executive and former Republican presidential candidate, to fill one of two empty seats on the Fed Board of Governors. Last month, Trump said he wanted ex-campaign adviser Stephen Moore, a partisan pundit, for the other seat.
Of course, the president is livid with the Fed for raising interest rates. On Thursday he tweeted: “Despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the Fed, the Economy is looking very strong."
Even though Fed chairman Jerome Powell has said more rate hikes are unlikely, in the last week alone Trump blasted him during three meetings with others, according to The Wall Street Journal. The president reportedly told Powell in a phone call, “I guess I'm stuck with you."
Tired of just jawboning the Fed, Trump seems eager to push for the appointment of two flunkeys who have demonstrated loyalty to him — and to some out-of-the-mainstream economic ideas that harken back to the days before the Fed was created.
“The White House had left the Fed alone until now, but the latest two picks may signal that has ended," said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.
You don't have to be the product of an elite university economics department to be a Fed governor. Powell, whom Trump chose to succeed Janet Yellen as Fed chairman in 2018, got his graduate degree in law (Georgetown). Ditto Quarles (Yale Law), who joined the Fed in October 2017.
But Powell and Quarles, as well as Clarida (PhD in economics from Harvard), have serious government cred, having held senior jobs in the Treasury Department. They also have heavy-hitting private-sector experience: Powell and Quarles worked for Carlyle Group, the big D.C.-based private equity firm, while Clarida was a managing director at fixed income giant Pacific Investment Management Co.
Bowman, selected to fill a board seat reserved for a community banker, was a vice president of Farmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas from 2010 to 2017, and later served as that state's bank commissioner.
Now let's turn to Moore and Cain.
Cain's main claim to fame, besides his failed presidential bid, was being CEO of Godfather's Pizza and then running the National Restaurant Association. During his campaign, which ended in 2011, Cain was hit by allegations of sexual harassment while at the restaurant trade group. He denied the accusations, but the issue would certainly come up during his confirmation hearing if he is formally nominated. Trump, who watched Brett Kavanaugh go through the #metoo grinder and still reach the high court, must not be bothered by that prospect.
Cain, 77, can point to Fed experience: He served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas and its chairman. But those are oversight jobs; they don't involve setting economic policy. When it comes to policy, Cain is in favor of a return to the gold standard and a flat tax, both dismissed as bad ideas by most economists.
Cain has been a consistent Trump supporter, and started a political action committee, America Fighting Back, because “The propaganda war of the progressive left must be countered and exposed to win the war for the hearts and minds of America."
Moore, 59, has also been a reliable backer of the president — but not much else. As a recent Globe editorial argued: “There's nothing in Moore's background to suggest he's capable of putting aside partisan politics; his whole career has been about generating justifications for Republican policy goals, gussied up in the language of economic analysis."
His big idea is pegging monetary policy to commodity prices, which most economists dismiss as overly simplistic. The Fed sets policy based on a broader set of prices as well as employment and other economic data.
Moore, who earned a master's in economics at George Mason University, was a member of the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal before going to the Heritage Foundation as distinguished visiting fellow. A recent Journal op-ed piece he cowrote heaping praise on Trump and criticizing the Fed may have caught Trump's eye.
The prospect of Moore and Cain joining the Fed board does not bode well for the central bank's reputation for staying above the political fray. Their only real qualifications are loyalty to Trump and a penchant for economic ideas from a simpler age that is shared by all three men.
“Both candidates' support for the president raises obvious questions about politicizing the Fed," Manulife's Greene wrote in an e-mail. “Whether they could impact Fed policy is difficult to tell — the institution's culture is strong and both candidates stand for some policies that are rejected by most establishment economists."
Indeed. There was fear that Powell would toe the Trump line, but he has gone his own way at times. And let's not forget the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts has not proven to be the rock-solid reliable vote many conservatives had expected him to be.
Do we dare hope the same for Cain or Moore?

President Trump retreats from threats to immediately close the border

Texto completo: President Trump retreated from threats to immediately close the border with Mexico over migration, instead abruptly pivoting on Thursday to a new demand: that the Mexican government stop the flow of illegal drugs into the US within a year or face car tariffs.
“If the drugs don't stop — Mexico can stop them if they want to — we are going to tariff the cars. The cars are very big, and if that doesn't work we are going to close the border," Trump said Thursday at the White House. “We are going to give them a one-year warning."
Trump also threatened to impose car tariffs if the country didn't step up its apprehension of migrants transiting through the country to the United States from Central and South America. The remarks, following a week of back-and-forth threats to close the border, risked further muddying the US relationship with its second-largest trading partner.
Trump said Mexico has improved immigration enforcement since he threatened to close the border last week. He has repeatedly used tariffs — or the threat of them — to achieve his policy goals, and has previously mentioned penalties on imported vehicles and auto parts.

In tweet, Trump mocks accusations against Biden
President Trump, ignoring his own history of buying a porn star's silence and bragging about sexual misconduct, on Thursday leveled another broadside at Joe Biden, tweeting a meme that mocked the former vice president for putting his hands on women's shoulders.
The 15-second meme, accompanied by the text “WELCOME BACK JOE!," doctored a video that Biden released Wednesday in which the former vice president explained his history of physical contact with women, some of whom say his behavior made them uncomfortable. Biden has said he tried to comfort people with hugs, kisses, and other physical contact when they appeared nervous.
In the meme, as Biden delivers his explanation, a pair of hands appears on his shoulders, and then an image of Biden's head pops up and appears to sniff the back of the former vice president's head. The meme appeared to be a reference to an accusation by a former Nevada assemblywoman, who said in an essay published last Friday that Biden had touched her shoulders, smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head at a campaign event in 2014.
Biden is widely expected to join the 2020 presidential race soon, and some Democrats view him as perhaps the most formidable challenger to Trump. But in the last week, accusations from several women that Biden touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable have threatened to upend his fledgling campaign, and on Wednesday, he addressed the claims directly for the first time in a video posted to his Twitter feed.
New York Times
Warren demands review of security at Mar-a-Lago
WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is calling for an investigation into whether the White House is overruling Secret Service recommendations about which guests at President Trump's Florida estate have access to him during his frequent weekend stays.
The request to the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security follows the arrest this past weekend of a Chinese woman after she bypassed layers of security and gained access to the reception area of Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club and was found carrying two passports and a thumb drive containing malicious software, according to court documents.
In a letter, Warren, along with Representative Stephen Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, cited a Government Accountability Office report published last month that said the White House ultimately determines who sees the president after vetting by the Secret Service.
Washington Post
Ryan of Ohio joins race for Democratic nomination
WASHINGTON — Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio announced a presidential bid Thursday, emphasizing education, health care, and the economy as he joined a diverse group of Democrats looking to take on President Trump in 2020.
In his first television interview as a candidate, Ryan cast himself as a "progressive who knows how to talk to working-class people" and said he could win back Rust Belt states lost to Trump in the 2016 election.
On a website that debuted Thursday, Ryan, who has a reputation in Washington as a moderate Democrat, highlighted issues of public education, affordable health care, and "an economy that works for all of us."
Washington Post
Buttigieg defends remarks on president's faith
Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who's gaining increased notice in the Democratic presidential nomination race, on Thursday defended his questioning of President Trump's belief in God, saying he felt obligated to call out the Republican's "hypocrisy."
Buttigieg, an Episcopalian, drew scrutiny for comments in a USA Today interview published Wednesday in which he said Trump's behavior is at odds with his understanding of the teachings of Christianity.
"I'm reluctant to comment on another person's faith, but I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God," Buttigieg said. "I just don't understand how you can be as worshipful of your own self as he is and be prepared to humble yourself before God. I've never seen him humble himself before anyone."
During an appearance on ABC's "Good Morning America" on Thursday, Buttigieg was pressed by host George Stephanopoulos on whether his comments were consistent with a need for "decency" in politics for which Buttigieg advocates in a recently released book.
"I work very hard to make sure when we oppose this president we're not emulating him, but we do need to call out hypocrisy when we see it," he said.

Biden vows change; Former VP, accused of inappropriate physical contact with women, defends past behavior

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a two-minute video released Wednesday, defended past behavior of close contact with women that has come under recent scrutiny, but also said he's able to change.
The response from Biden, who is laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run, came a day after two more women shared stories of encounters with him that they alleged were inappropriate. Their comments followed similar complaints from two other women.
"I want to talk about gestures of support that I've made to women and some men that have made them uncomfortable," Biden said, seated on a couch and speaking directly to the camera. "I've always tried to make a human connection that's my responsibility, I think ... it's the way I've always been, it's the way I try to show I care about them and listening."
But despite that, Biden said, he is going to be "mindful" of people's boundaries going forward.
"The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. I get it, I get it, I hear what they're saying and I understand it," he said. "I'll be much more mindful, that's my responsibility and I'll meet it."
Biden stopped short of apologizing for his past behavior, instead circling back to his previous defense that politics is about human connection.
Questions about Biden's behavior with women have flared since last Friday when Lucy Flores, a politician in Nevada, shared her first-person account of an alleged incident with Biden at a campaign event when she claims he kissed the back of her head.
Since then, Amy Lappos, a Connecticut woman, has alleged Biden rubbed noses with her at a fundraiser in Greenwich in 2009. Lappos said she decided to share her own story about Biden putting his hand around her neck and pulling her in to rub noses after seeing how Flores was attacked after she told her story.
The alleged Connecticut incident occurred during a $1,000-per-plate luncheon on Oct. 5, 2009, at the home of affordable housing developer Ron Moelis. Biden spoke for about 20 minutes outside the home on a terrace, which was open to the media. Reporters were not allowed inside the house, which is where Lappos said the incident took place. Lappos appeared in three photos with Biden at the event, which she said were taken after his remarks and before the incident. She said she was in the kitchen with four to five other volunteers, when Biden moved toward her.
"We remain in the midst of a national discussion about what constitutes appropriate behavior," Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz said earlier this week. "It takes courage to come forward to discuss the actions of those that have held, do hold, or hope to hold high office. I respect Joe Biden's decades of dedicated service to our country. I also respect the right of Amy Lappos to tell her story."
On Tuesday, The New York Times published stories of two women who also allege Biden touched them in ways that they say were not appropriate.
Biden's propensity for being affectionate, once brushed off as "Biden being Biden" is now being viewed through a #MeToo lens. It could prove problematic for his expected presidential run, especially since some women have not forgiven him for his handling of Anita Hill's testimony in 1991 at the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, which he oversaw.
But Biden's defenders point to his work sponsoring the Violence Against Women's Act and combating sexual assault on campus as examples of how he's led on these issues throughout his career.
In the video, Biden also defends his record.
"I worked my whole life to empower women, to prevent abuse, so the idea that I can't adjust to the fact that personal space is important, more important than it's ever been, is just not thinkable," he said. "I will. I will."

Texto completo: Elon Musk has come under recent scrutiny from the SEC for some ill-advised tweets, from shareholders about closing stores, and even paparazzis for his relationship to indie musician Grimes.
Those blows were probably softened by his $2.28 billion compensation last fiscal year from Tesla. That means his compensation is 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker’s, which is about $56,200, according to Bloomberg.
Tesla has about 48,800 employees, the news outlet reported. The majority of Musk’s total compensation, which would be paid out over 10 years, is in stock options contingent on Tesla hitting several targets for revenue, market value and more, Bloomberg said.
So far, the company has met two of the 16 goals, according to that news organization. Tesla is required to pay Musk at least minimum wage, about $37,000 a year, but he told the New York Times he doesn’t cash the checks and therefore does not receive an annual salary.
Tesla had the largest CEO-to-median worker compensation ratio among public companies in the data analyzed by Bloomberg. However, Musk’s realized compensation last year was $56,380, which would make the CEO to median worker ratio 1-to-1, according to documents Tesla filed with the SEC.
In addition to salaries and stock options, CEO compensation can include bonuses and even additional costs incurred by companies on their bosses’ behalves.
For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a salary of just $1 but a total compensation of $8.85 million in fiscal year 2017. That includes $7.3 million for Zuckerberg’s personal security at his Palo Alto home, as well as when he’s traveling, plus $1.5 million for his use of a private airplane, according to a 2018 proxy statement.
Facebook employees had a median compensation of $240,430, so Zuckerberg had a 37-to-1 ratio. That’s far smaller than the median CEO to employee ratio of 137-to-1, according to Bloomberg. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, had total compensation of about $25.2 million in fiscal year 2017, mostly in stock awards, according to the proxy statement.
Twitter’s median employee compensation was lower, $161,860, but their CEO, Jack Dorsey, didn’t take a salary. Dorsey was paid $2.75 by Square, the payment processing company he also runs. Square employees have a median compensation of about $152,300.
Likewise, Alphabet — the company formerly known as Google — paid its CEO Larry Page $1 in fiscal year 2017, the most recent data available from Bloomberg. The median Alphabet employee earned almost $197,300.
Salesforce’s billionaire CEO Marc Benioff had $4.65 million in compensation, and his median employee earned about $155,300 — a 30-to-1 ratio. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation was $15.68 million, a 238-to-1 ratio to the tech giant’s median employee, who earned about $55,400.

Aide calls Puerto Rico 'that country'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — White House spokesman Hogan Gidley twice referred to Puerto Rico as "that country" during a television appearance Tuesday in which he defended a series of tweets by President Trump lashing out at leaders of the US territory. In two bursts of tweets — one late Monday night and another Tuesday morning — Trump complained about the amount of federal relief money going to the island and called its politicians "incompetent or corrupt."
He also claimed that Puerto Rico "got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane," a figure that actually reflects a high-end, long-term estimate for recovery costs. Only a fraction of that has so far been budgeted, and even less has been spent.
As he pressed to defend Trump's contentions, Gidley sought to make the case that the leaders of the territory, whose residents are US citizens, have mishandled the aid they've received thus far.
"With all they've done in that country, they've had a systematic mismanagement of the goods and services we've sent to them," Gidley said. "You've seen food just rotting in the ports. Their governor has done a horrible job. He's trying to make political hay in a political year, and he's trying to find someone to take the blame off of his for not having a grid and not having a good system in that country at all."
Gidley later attributed his misstatements to "a slip of the tongue."

Trump brand falls short on appeal, personality metric
WASHINGTON — President Trump has long been focused on measuring his brand, obsessively reviewing television ratings, cataloging his magazine covers, and fixating on polls.
But Trump may not like how his brand is faring in one important metric: his “E-Score," a number compiled by E-Poll Market Research that is not publicly available, but which marketing executives, network television stations, and advertisers rely on to figure out which personalities appeal to audiences — and which do not.
Like the Q Score, which measures the appeal of celebrities, the E-Score calculates awareness and appeal of individuals in the public eye. But it also tracks how individuals score on more than 40 personality and physical attributes.
In terms of those attributes, Trump was most often described as “aggressive" (48 percent) and “mean" (38 percent), according to his scores from December that were obtained by The New York Times. He also scored high for being “insincere," “confident," and “creepy." But he scored between 0 and 4 percent for the attributes of “sexy," “impartial," “handsome," and “physically fit."
About 29 percent of people described Trump as “overexposed." And his overall strong positive appeal is 14 percent, compared with an overall strong negative appeal of 39 percent.
Among adults over age 55, Trump consistently held more positive appeal than among those who are younger. Trump also consistently held more positive appeal with men than with women, across all age groups.

Sanders raises $18m in quarter, outpacing rivals
Senator Bernie Sanders raised $18.2 million for his presidential campaign during the first quarter of the year, a sizable sum that establishes him as an early pacesetter in the money chase underway in the Democratic primary.
Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said the total came from 525,000 donors and 900,000 individual donations. Sanders, a Vermont Independent, launched his campaign Feb. 19.
The number of individual donations fell short of the campaign's established goal of 1 million.
The senator ended the first quarter with $28 million in his campaign account, according to Shakir. As a senator, Sanders is eligible to transfer money from his Senate campaign account.
Many close observers expected Sanders to report a hefty first quarter sum. He turned heads when he announced raising about $6 million in his first 24 hours as a presidential candidate, surprising some Democrats who were uncertain whether his loyal coalition of small-dollar donors would renew its support for him during his second run for president.
Only Beto O'Rourke, who raised about $6.1 million, pulled in more than Sanders on his first day. O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman who entered the campaign late in the quarter, has yet to release his total for the period.
Sanders is the third candidate in the Democratic primary to release his first-quarter numbers, which must be reported to the Federal Election Commission by April 15.
Senator Kamala D. Harris, a California Democrat, who announced her candidacy Jan. 21, raised $12 million in the first quarter, she said Monday. Mayor Pete Buttigieg from South Bend, Ind., reported $7 million.

Pelosi says Biden's behavior not "disqualifying" to run
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, on Tuesday offered some advice to former vice president Joe Biden, who has been under heightened scrutiny for his intimate physical style with women: "Join the straight arm club" and shake hands with people as if you both have colds.
Pelosi said she doesn't consider Biden's behavior "disqualifying" for the presidency but said "he has to understand that in the world we're in now, people's space is important to them."
Her comments came during an interview with Politico reporters in front of a live audience.
Pressed about accusations from women who've said Biden made them uncomfortable, Pelosi shared that she has a very different style of interacting with people.
Pelosi said she has known Biden for decades and shared that her grandchildren "love Joe Biden," adding: "He's a very affectionate person."
Biden, who has appeared to be on the cusp of announcing a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, is facing questions about whether a self-described "tactile politician" is well-suited for the White House in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

Texto completo: Baltimore mayor has made hundreds of thousands of dollars
When the president of the National Writers Union heard how much Baltimore Mayor Catherine E. Pugh had been paid for her children's books, he paused.
"What?" said Larry Goldbetter, who has led the union for a decade. "No way."
Pugh (D) has been paid nearly $700,000 for her self-published "Healthy Holly" series by businesses intertwined with the government she has overseen - a figure that has raised eyebrows in the world of children's book publishing, where it can often be hard for even full-time authors to make a living.
Facing a groundswell of criticism and a request by Gov. Larry Hogan (R) for an investigation by the state prosecutor, Pugh took an indefinite leave of absence Monday, citing health concerns.
Hogan wants a probe into Pugh's book deal with the University of Maryland Medical System, which paid her $500,000 for a total of 100,000 books.
"It's crazy to wrap your brain around a six-figure number of books being sold," said Wendy Dean, who owns Baltimore-based Omnibus Publishing, which focuses on children's books. "To sell 100,000 books - that is your ultimate goal. . . . It feels like that would be equivalent to being on the New York Times bestseller list every week for a year."
Dean estimated that a big publishing house working with a first-time author might sell and distribute 10,000 books, although she said numbers vary, especially for self-published books.
UMMS paid Pugh for five orders of 20,000 books each, beginning in 2011, when she was a state senator who served on a committee that partially funded the hospital network, the Baltimore Sun first reported.
She returned $100,000 for the last order in the series, which she said is not complete.
The Sun also reported that Kaiser Permanente paid Pugh more than $100,000 for about 20,000 copies and that Associated Black Charities paid her $80,000 for 10,000 copies.
The Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund, a quasi-public company created by the legislature, gave $7,500 in 2012 to Pugh's Healthy Holly LLC, according to the fund's executive director. At the time, Pugh was a state lawmaker who sponsored legislation favored by the fund. The next year, the fund gave $5,000 to Associated Black Charities, which was collecting money for "Healthy Holly" books. The fund's donations were first reported by the Sun.
Pugh attorney Steve Silverman did not respond to questions about these deals.
On Tuesday, Baltimore City Council member Ryan Dorsey asked Baltimore Inspector General Isabel Cumming to investigate the bidding and awarding of a $48 million contract that Kaiser received from the city in 2017, when Pugh was profiting from her book deal with the company.
Kaiser spokesman Scott Lusk did not respond to questions Tuesday but said in a statement Monday that Kaiser's purchase of the "Healthy Holly" series came nearly 30 years after the company was selected to provide coverage for city employees and "has no connection with our commitment to continue offering our care to Baltimore City government employees."
Dean, who has lived in Baltimore since 2002, said she has spoken in recent days with some in the children's book industry who are upset by the size of Pugh's contracts.
"There is frustration, especially on the authors' end," she said. "This is what they do for a living. They put their blood, sweat and tears into this, and they still might not make a living."
Children's book author Christina Allen, who runs a small publishing house in Lexington Park, Md., said she had never heard of orders as large as Pugh's for first-time authors of picture books.
"Whoa," Allen said. "That is an impressive number of books."
Allen said her first book, about a rare breed of turkey on her farm, sold about 8,000 copies. "I don't make any money," she said. "I'm doing it because I enjoy it. Maybe I'll make money one day."
Elected mayor in 2016, Pugh earns $178,000 annually. She also owns a boutique clothing store. In 2005, she wrote a poetry book titled "Mind Garden: Where Thoughts Grow." A copy of that book is for sale on Amazon for $100.
The "Healthy Holly" books follow the adventures of an African American girl named Holly and are intended to promote healthy living.
Pugh spokesman James E. Bentley II referred "Healthy Holly" book questions to Silverman. He said the mayor, who had a recent bout with pneumonia, is "at home, trying to get well."
Pugh said at a news conference last week that the deals with UMMS were a "regrettable mistake." An independent audit of the medical school system and contracts made by its board members began Tuesday, interim chief executive John Ashworth said.
Pugh used a Canadian printing company to complete the first three orders for UMMS. She showed shipping manifests for those orders at the news conference.
Joseph Cohen, vice president of Kromar Printing in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said his company was paid between $13,000 and $15,000 for each of the 20,000-book orders it completed. He said that price range is standard for picture books between 28 and 32 pages.
He said his company was not asked to print a fourth batch. Pugh said at the news conference that it recently came to her attention that the fourth order of books had been delayed and was not completed.
"We're just the printer," Cohen added. "It sounds like we got caught up in a pretty big story."
The controversy swirling around Pugh comes as Baltimore is struggling with a surge of violence that officials have struggled to address. Homicides have topped 300 for four straight years, even as homicide arrest rates have plummeted, and there have been five police commissioners in as many years.
Baltimore City Council President Bernard C. "Jack" Young (D), the acting mayor, told reporters at the Maryland State House on Tuesday that Baltimore "is in good hands."
"I've been doing this for the last 21 years, making them wheels turn," said Young, who has served on the council for more than two decades and said he will not run for mayor in 2020. "It's going to continue to turn."

Texto completo: Doug Lynam said he became a monk to get away from his rich-kid childhood and escape money altogether.
But money matters affect a monastery as much as any business or residence.
Lynam discovered this early on at his monastery, where he determined the monks had left financial concerns to the will of God.
Lynam took it upon himself as the youngest monk to climb the monastery's mountain of debt.
He read several financial advice books, enough to bone up on guiding the monastery -- he won't disclose which one -- through the only feasible solution: bankruptcy proceedings.
Fast forward 20 years, and Lynam now has his own financial advice book out: From Monk to Money Manager.
Lynam, 45, said he left the monastic life in 2016 and now is director of education and retirement services at LongView Asset Management in downtown Santa Fe.
"I wish I had this book when I was in my early 20s," Lynam said, "because it would have helped me reconcile my spiritual values with a healthy approach to money. I think [readers] are going to learn how money really works and how it aligns with spiritual values."
The transition from monk to money manager sounds as unlikely as it gets. But instead of escaping money as a monk, money pretty much became his avocation at the monastery.
After steering the monastery through bankruptcy, Lynam's spiritual counseling of guests often veered to financial counseling.
"The majority of people I met, if you dig deep enough, you'll likely find financial problems," Lynam said.
As a teacher at Santa Fe Prep (nearly all the monks had day jobs), the school suddenly needed an economics teacher, and Lynam stepped up to the challenge. As a class project, Lynam looked at the school's pension fund for teachers.
He did not expect to find a pension fund with no fiduciary overlooking the plan. The school did not realize new federal regulations were in place requiring independent schools to have a fiduciary for pension funds.
"Doug helped us get a fiduciary," said Jim Leonard, the head of school at Santa Fe Prep. "We were basically ahead of the curve because of Doug."
At about the same time, the New York Times wrote about widespread problems with teacher pension funds. Lynam called the paper and was featured in a June 2017 Times article about "the monk who left the monastery to fix broken retirement plans."
LongView, which boasts a "socially responsible and sustainable investment" philosophy, in the coming weeks is set to become New Mexico's sixth B Corp, or benefit corporation, principal David Cantor said.
B Corp is a private certification issued by Pennsylvania nonprofit B Lab, which acknowledges a business's social sustainability and environmental performance.
Lynam's own financial philosophy seeks to debunk the saying that "money is the root of all evil." He appends that with "money makes the world go round."
"How is money going to be used as a tool to alleviate suffering in the world?" Lynam poses. And from the book: "God is calling us all to be a little wealthy and master the art of money management because it will reduce our suffering and allow our acts of service to have a larger impact."
Lynam draws a clear distinction between wealth and being rich. Being rich is having a lot of money and likely spending it all. Wealth is investing money so it earns more money, he said.
"What do you need to ensure you aren't at risk of ever being poor again?" Lynam wrote in the book. "The answer is simple: you need to be a little wealthy. ... It's okay to be a little wealthy. In fact, it's necessary. ... Just make sure your purchases have great personal value. Not because you are 'keeping up with the Joneses.' The Joneses are broke and in debt."
Lynam's young-adult aversion to money spawned from a childhood where, he said, his parents "weaponized" money as a "tool of manipulation and control." (His mother, Lois Pollard, sees how Lynam could have this view, considering the parents divorced when he was 7 and there were many years of disputes of who would pay for what. "What he's seeing is his vision of what is important to him," Pollard said. "He saw this as weaponly.")
On the way to becoming a monk, Lynam said he undertook summer Marine Corps officer candidate school in Quantico, Va., for four years while enrolled at St. John's College in Santa Fe.
He ultimately did not pursue a commission and became a monk instead.
Lynam took the necessary courses to pass the finance licensing tests, but he doesn't have an MBA or any such college finance degree.
"There's no curriculum or rhyme or reason for a monastery," Lynam said. "The range of guests' financial problems are so broad. I saw everything: debt management, child support, divorce, retirement."
He started his own financial adviser business while still a monk, Lynam Financial Services, which he merged with LongView a year later. And he taught at Santa Fe Prep. And he was a monk.
"I was working three full-time jobs," Lynam said. "Something had to give."
The book is available in Santa Fe at op.cit. books and Garcia Street Books.

Texto completo: The technology sector doesn't have the best track record when it comes to the treatment of people who aren't straight white men.
Uber settled a lawsuit last year over allegations that women and minorities employed by the ride-service company faced harassment and discrimination. Last fall, The New York Times reported that Google protected three executives accused of sexual misconduct, prompting a nationwide walkout by employees.
By contrast, there hasn't been much research and reporting on what the sector is like for members of the LGBTQ community, especially those who identify as transgender, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming. But the anecdotal evidence is discouraging.
“If you think being a woman in tech is hard, try being nonbinary in tech," Lianna Newman, a software engineer in Washington, D.C., said.
Newman, who identifies as nonbinary and does not use pronouns, described workplaces that were uninviting or outright hostile to nonbinary people.
But there are efforts to make the sector more inclusive of those who don't adhere to strict gender norms both in the United States and elsewhere. Some of that work is happening in Boston.
A recent hackathon billed as TechTogether Boston drew about 600 participants to Boston University's Agganis Arena. In 2018, the first year the event was held, it was called SheHacks, and marketed heavily toward women. This year, organizers opted to remove “she" from the name and promote the event to equally to women and nonbinary people.
“We did have a very long conversation about what our policies are, how can we make the event more inclusive," founder Fiona Whittington said. Ultimately, organizers decided “she" was not representative of all of the people they wanted to feel welcome.
Logistics were also taken into account. This year's event had gender-neutral bathrooms; last year's didn't.
“It was just a natural change," said Gefen Skolnick, another organizer who worked on the event. “We allow anyone to come to the hackathon, but we want to make it feel like you are welcome. It's the difference between telling someone you can be somewhere versus making them feel like they can be somewhere."
TechTogether isn't the only event trying to carve out a space for transgender people in tech.
Last year, a conference held in England called Non-Binary In Tech welcomed nonbinary people who were interested in the tech scene, while a summit held last March in San Francisco, called Transform Tech, focused on ways to make the sector more inclusive for transgender people. And an event called HackHer413 billed itself as the first hackathon in Western Massachusetts exclusively for women and nonbinary people.
Anuva Kalawar, communications manager for the international advocacy group Out in Tech said efforts to make tech more inclusive largely originate with transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming activists.
“This kind of organizing has happened for a number of years," Kalawar, who identifies as transgender and nonbinary, said. “I think it's having a ripple effect in more spaces as trans rights become more and more discussed and more and more known in the public."
As an example, Kalawar cited an entrepreneurship panel for transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people put together by Out in Tech at Google in Washington, D.C.
Newman, the software engineer, heads the organization's D.C. chapter and participated in that panel. Newman said it provided attendees with a better idea of how to navigate the workplace and the tech sector at large.
“A lot of people appreciated it," Newman said.
Retention can prove challenging in an industry that has a reputation for being unwelcoming to outsiders, according to Michelle Glauser, founder of the nonprofit Techtonica, which provides training and job-placement services for women and nonbinary people in the San Francisco Bay Area. Glauser said her organization also runs inclusion workshops for employers.
“We don't want our graduates running away screaming from tech, because that happens a lot with underrepresented people in tech," she said. “They end up leaving just because it doesn't feel worth their emotional health to stay."
Newman's experiences seem to reflect that.
“I love tech. I love the work that I do," Newman said. “But I haven't really been able to focus on it, honestly."
But even though the industry remains a challenging place for nonbinary, transgender, and gender nonconforming people, Out In Tech's Kalawar believes advocacy and activist groups are making a difference.
“We're going to see the industry change, but [tech companies] need support from advocacy groups," they said.

Waves of immigrants overwhelm asylum process

Texto completo: Before 2013, about one of every 100 immigrants arriving at our borders asked for asylum. Now, it’s one out of every 10.
The glut of immigrants at our southern border has President Donald Trump telling asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico, as he threatens to close the border completely.
"If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug (sic) our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week," Trump posted Friday on Twitter.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency has begun performing "direct releases" into the U.S. of some asylum-seekers arriving over the Mexico border because of overcrowding at its two facilities and others run by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Lawsuits over immigration policy are nearly as common as tweets.
Some say the increase in people seeking asylum is evidence the world has grown more dangerous. Others say immigrants are abusing the system. Yet, in 2018, 76 percent of those seeking asylum presented enough evidence to pass the initial U.S. screening establishing they had credible fears of persecution in their home countries.
That standard stems from The Refugee Act of 1980, which opened U.S. asylum as a legal process to anyone on the planet with a "well-founded fear of persecution" due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Passing the "credible fear" hurdle by no means indicates asylum will be granted, but it does allow entrance to the U.S. while a case is being heard — a process that now can take years.
"A credible fear referral doesn’t equal asylum status, but it does earn a free ticket into the U.S., allowing individuals to disappear into the interior to live and work illegally," says Jessica Collins, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. "The reality is that our asylum system is being exploited by those simply seeking economic opportunity, not those fleeing persecution, exacerbating crisis after crisis at our Southern border and keeping those who truly need asylum in the back of the line."
Few immigrants have hope of another route to legally reside in the United States. With caps and quotas on legal immigration by country, even immigrants with family or jobs in the U.S. often must wait years and even decades to be allowed entry. Demand for about 140,000 immigrant worker visas a year far exceeds the supply, and most are available to people with "extraordinary" abilities or advanced degrees.
While asylum requests have soared, the number of people arrested on charges of illegally crossing the border has dropped sharply since 2000, according to The New York Times.
Illegally crossing the border is a criminal offense, but asylum is a matter for civil courts. And that is where change is most needed, says David Iglesias, a Wheaton College professor who prosecuted many criminal cases between 2001 and 2007 as U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico.
"The laws haven’t caught up," says Iglesias, director of the Wheaton Center for Faith, Politics and Economics. Some people seeking asylum might not meet the legal requirements when it comes to race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, but they still have a well-founded fear of persecution due to gangs or violence in their homeland, Iglesias said.
Asylum is granted unevenly. Statistics from 2015 show that New York City immigration judges denied 16 percent of asylum requests, while judges in Atlanta denied 98 percent.
And then there is the backlog of cases.
By the end of 2018, there were 325,514 asylum cases pending. In December, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services completed 5,953 cases but received 8,015 new applications. Of those, 1,926 (24 percent) came from Venezuela. Guatemala was second with 716, followed by China with 639, El Salvador with 428, Mexico with 388, Honduras with 378, Haiti with 260, India with 200, Nigeria with 188, Colombia with 161 and a smattering from other countries.
The U.S. has taken in more than 2 million people seeking asylum since World War II, but "we can’t take everybody in," Iglesias says. Instead of spending money on a wall, "we need more immigration judges," who can determine those with legitimate cases, he says.
For fiscal year 2019, Immigration and Customs Enforcement requested $571 million to hire 2,000 immigration officers. The Department of Justice requested $40 million to hire new immigration judges and supporting staff.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration seeks to tighten the "credible fear" guidelines and is turning back some asylum-seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico until their cases can be heard.

Trading Deal Making for Disruption, and a 'Whole Hell of a Lot of Cable'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida came to Washington in 2017 with a reputation for bipartisan deal-cutting in the State Legislature -- then spent a year idling behind the slow-moving minivans in the House Republican Conference like a Mustang stuck in traffic.
So he decided to go the full Trump. With a near-constant presence on the president's favorite network and a penchant for own-the-libs outrageousness, Mr. Gaetz has, in short order, become the lawmaker Democrats love to loathe. It is all part of the plan.
"In a world where the body politic has the attention span at times of a goldfish, yep, you've got to have the ability to reinvent yourself in this game many times," said Mr. Gaetz, who in his second term representing Florida's western Panhandle has emerged as one of President Trump's fiercest and most frequent defenders on Fox News, CNN and MSNBC.
"I did one cable news hit during my first 10 months in Congress," he said during an interview in his Capitol Hill office last week. "Yeah. And now it's only a couple of years later and The New York Times is sitting in my office asking me about my life. The only thing that's changed is a little bit of time and a whole hell of a lot of cable."
Many Republicans in Congress stick close to Mr. Trump's feed-the-base strategy, but few are more naturally inclined to adopt the president's brass-knuckles brand of politics than Mr. Gaetz, 36, the ambitious son of a former Florida State Senate president, Don Gaetz.
"Matt feeds off disruption; it's just this big adrenaline rush for him," said Christian Ulvert, a Miami-based Democratic political consultant who met Mr. Gaetz at Florida State University in the early 2000s. "But it puts a ceiling on him, because it wears thin after a while, and it puts so many people off."
Steve Schale, a friend of Mr. Gaetz from Tallahassee who ran Barack Obama's 2008 campaign in Florida, said he viewed it essentially as a game and "is adjusting as the rules shift."
There are not too many rules these days. Early last year, Mr. Gaetz brought Chuck Johnson, a right-wing activist who has questioned whether six million Jews really died in the Holocaust, to the State of the Union address. (This year Mr. Gaetz denounced anti-Semitism on the House floor.)
He tried to expel two fathers who lost children to a gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School from a hearing after they stood up to object to his claim that a wall on the Mexican border would save more lives than gun control.
He has feuded with Rick Scott, the newly elected senator and former Republican governor of Florida, over Mr. Scott's frosty relationship with his successor, Ron DeSantis, and Mr. Scott's decision to block the elder Mr. Gaetz from garnering a plum university presidency.
A month ago, on the eve of testimony by Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, he dashed off a Twitter post that brought him his biggest headlines and accusations of witness intimidation. "Hey @MichaelCohen212," he wrote. "Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she'll remain faithful when you're in prison. She's about to learn a lot..."
Mr. Cohen's lawyer, Lanny J. Davis, said Mr. Gaetz had peddled "despicable lies and personal smears." Mr. Scott called it "disgusting." The Florida Bar opened an investigation, still continuing, into whether the tweet should affect his ability to practice law in the state.
He deleted it and issued a follow-up claiming that "it was NOT my intent to threaten." The president loved it, and Mr. Gaetz has been less than contrite about the incident with Mr. Trump, according to an administration official who spoke to the president recently.
"I wanted to cast him in a bad light," Mr. Gaetz said of Mr. Cohen.
But Mr. Gaetz is quick to say he is no one-dimensional Trump wingman.
"I'm on the pro-science side of the Republican Party," he added. "I mean, like, marijuana can help people live better lives as medicine, the earth is warming and nobody chooses to be gay."
Indeed, Mr. Gaetz -- known as Baby Gaetz in Tallahassee to differentiate him from his more powerful father -- made his reputation back home as a serious, if combative, legislator who played an instrumental role helping Mr. Scott, then the governor, kill efforts to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
He also joined with Democratic lawmakers to push marijuana legalization, and he persuaded his father in 2015 to join Democrats to pass a law that removed Florida's ban on adoptions by same-sex couples. He initially supported Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, for president in 2016 before jumping over to Mr. Trump. His father was a Bush supporter, and his younger sister worked on the Bush campaign as a video producer.
Mr. Gaetz is also a passionate champion of animal rights. On the day of the Cohen tweet, he sent text messages to offer condolences to Mr. Schale after his dog died. When he served in the Florida House, he pushed to end greyhound racing.
"Matt has played both the hero and the villain," said Ryan Wiggins, a Republican political consultant who worked on his first congressional campaign. "I suspect he probably enjoys the reactions he gets when he makes people's heads explode on the national stage."
With a promontory chin and crooked grin, Mr. Gaetz cultivates an air of genial menace, like a netherworld Jay Leno. His email handle in college was Gaetzofhell, a classmate recalled.
His transition to Washington was bumpy. In early 2017, at a lunch for the incoming freshman class at the Capitol, he complained to table mates about how tough it was to be a backbencher and railed, in four-letter fashion, against the House Freedom Caucus -- now his allies -- for being "a bunch of obstructionists," according to a person sitting nearby.
"I would end my days exhausted," Mr. Gaetz recalled. "I was unable to rationalize what I had done to make progress. If you can't impact an outcome in this town you are an extra in the movie, and I do not want to do that."
He started tracking his Fox News appearances more carefully, and turned up the volume on his defenses of Mr. Trump, in part, he said, to gain more sway with the White House on local issues. He said he has used his private access to the president to help block drilling off the Gulf Coast -- even if Mr. Trump just wants to critique his television appearances and mock his fashion choices.
"What are the things you can do to impact an outcome?" he asked. "Well, the most valuable real estate in the world lies between the president's ears. And if I can be a good friend and ally and influencer in calling to the president, then I can impact outcomes without having to be a whore for special interests."
He threw himself into the governor's campaign of Mr. DeSantis in 2018, and sees Mr. DeSantis as the key to his post-Trump political fortunes.
The day after Mr. DeSantis was elected, Mr. Gaetz reached out to the governor-elect's team and asked if there was any way Ashley Moody, the new state attorney general, could be persuaded to take another job -- to clear the way for his appointment, according to two Republican operatives.
No way, he was told.
He is also open, friends said, to another bank-shot DeSantis appointment. If Kansas Republicans sell Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on a run for then Senate next year and if Mr. Trump then nominates Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, to replace Mr. Pompeo, maybe Mr. DeSantis would pick him to fill out Mr. Rubio's term.
When asked about that possibility, Mr. Gaetz grinned and said, "Marco would be a historic pick" for the cabinet job.

The Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The news that special counsel Robert Mueller “did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government” has left a lot of people in Washington with a lot of explaining to do.
Put aside the rogues’ gallery of reporters and pundits who assured us that Donald Trump had conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the presidency. What is most insidious are those who did have access to classified intelligence and led Americans to believe that they had seen what we could not: actual evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.
Recall that in 2016, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., released a letter to FBI Director James Comey claiming the FBI had proof of Trump-Russia collusion. “In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government,” Reid declared. When asked what information Reid was referring to, a spokesman said, “There have been classified briefings on this topic. That is all I can say.”
Trump has called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to resign. He is absolutely correct. Schiff repeatedly said that his committee had dug up “plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy.” In March 2017, he said on “Meet the Press,” “I can’t go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now” and last May he told ABC that Trump’s Russia conspiracy is of “a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.”
Schiff is a disgrace. But he is not alone. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, “In our investigation, we saw strong evidence of collusion” and declared Trump an agent “working on behalf of the Russians.” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed, “It’s clear that the campaign colluded, and there’s a lot of evidence of that.” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee, assured us last year that “the evidence is pretty clear that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.”
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, “There is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America’s democracy.” And recently, the committee’s vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., declared that “enormous amounts of evidence” exist of collusion between Trump and Russia and that “there’s no one that could factually say there’s not plenty of evidence of collaboration or communications between Trump Organization and Russians.” Except for Mueller, of course.
These comments by people with access to intelligence were shameful. But the most sinister of all is John Brennan, who used his authority as former CIA director to suggest that Trump was a traitor and a compromised Russian asset. After Trump’s Helsinki summit, Brennan declared “he is wholly in the pocket of Putin.” When challenged by Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press,” Brennan stood by his assessment. “I called [Trump’s] behavior treasonous, which is to betray one’s trust and aid and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim.”
This month, MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell told Brennan this investigation was “developing while you were still on the job” and asked, “Did you see enough at that stage to believe ... that that would result in indictments?” Brennan replied, “I thought at the time there was going to be individuals who were going to have issues with the Department of Justice. Yes.” In a New York Times op-ed, he wrote that “Trump’s claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash.”
Now, Brennan feigns contrition. “I don’t know if I received bad information, but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was,” he said, adding, “I am relieved that it’s been determined there was not a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government over our election.”
Hogwash. He wanted it to be true, and he relied on his CIA credentials to convince Americans that it was. That is a violation of the public trust. Trump was right to revoke Brennan’s security clearance. He is among the worst of the worst, the Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame. We have long since passed the point where Americans expect objectivity from the press. But we should hold our elected and appointed officials handling sensitive national security issues to a higher standard.

Texto completo: John Huston's "Beat the Devil," the Humphrey Bogart vehicle once advertised as a decade ahead of its time, is now an official senior citizen, having opened in New York 65 years ago this month.
One of the first Hollywood productions to be hailed as a cult film, this parodic thriller about a bumbling scheme to loot Africa's uranium mines was an outlier in the successful Huston-Bogart collaborations. With Huston directing from a script doctored by Truman Capote, the film was initially promoted as a romantic adventure in the tradition of "Casablanca." On its release in 1954, however, "Beat the Devil" baffled audiences, who didn't get the in-jokes and plot twists and turns.
Bogart stars as a middle-aged fixer hired by a ragtag group of crooks who become entangled with a seemingly innocent British couple (Jennifer Jones and Edward Underdown). Given the movie's shaggy-dog quest, Huston evidently imagined "Beat the Devil" as another "Maltese Falcon," his first film, even casting Peter Lorre, a featured player in "Maltese Falcon," for good luck, with the portly Robert Morley standing in for Sydney Greenstreet, a seeker of the falcon. Visiting the town of Ravello on Italy's Amalfi Coast, where "Beat the Devil" was being filmed, a New York Times reporter noted that Huston was harking back to another one of his Bogart triumphs, "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."
The gale of laughter that ends "Beat the Devil" does recall "Sierra Madre," but this time the joke was on Huston. "A potential treat emerged as a wet firecracker in some sixty-eight neighborhood theaters yesterday where United Artists unveiled its singularly unorthodox 'Beat the Devil,"' the Times review said, comparing the movie unfavorably to its source, a potboiler of a novel pseudonymously written by the left-wing journalist Claud Cockburn.
Huston, a friend of Cockburn's, prodded Bogart to buy the rights and put money into the film. Vexing the Production Code censors with its relaxed take on criminal behavior and tolerance of spouse-swapping, the movie played down the novel's anti-imperialist bent but maintained its worldly attitude -- something for which Capote took credit.
Jones was cast as Bogart's dizzy adulterous love interest. Consequently, the actress's real-life husband, the powerful producer David O. Selznick, watched over the film, bringing on Capote, who had recently worked on a Selznick production, to fix the script. Although the late scenes set in North Africa are likely Capote's doing, his influence has been exaggerated. Many of the movie's most memorable dialogue involving Bogart's cutting witticisms and Jones's contrived innocence can be found in Cockburn's novel.
"Beat the Devil" is a film whose supposed shortcomings are actually its appealing qualities. Introduced wearing a floridly patterned robe with matching ascot, Bogart is less formidable than the tough guys he played in the 1940s, marginalized by a colorful parade of character actors including the unexpectedly droll Gina Lollobrigida, appearing in her first major English-language film.
Thanks to Bogart's perplexed underplaying and the anticlimactic ending, "Beat the Devil" was misunderstood in much the way that Elaine May's not dissimilar anti-thriller "Ishtar" would be in 1987. Overshadowed by its much-mythologized back story -- Capote and Huston claimed that the movie was more-or-less made up as they went along -- the project lived in infamy. "Bogie sent me a copy of an advertisement an exhibitor had taken out in a newspaper saying this was the worst picture he had ever had in his theater," Huston would recall. "Beat the Devil" disappeared from view, a notorious flop that rarely, if ever, was shown on television. Then in February 1964, it reopened in a Greenwich Village movie house and proved so successful that it enjoyed an uptown move-over and revival showings in other cities.
"The film that was ten years ahead of its time is ten years old ... (It's time!)," a newspaper ad proclaimed. Yet "Beat the Devil" was very much of its time -- not just because it was a star vehicle produced by the star rather than by a studio.
For one thing, the movie was released during a thaw in the Cold War, among a flurry of films that made light of international tensions. For another, it rode the wave of a growing popularity of Italian movies. Besides Lollobrigida, who was praised by Bogart as a woman who "makes Marilyn Monroe look like Shirley Temple," the cast included Italian character actors. (Indeed, the mood anticipated Italian comedies like Mario Monicelli's "Big Deal on Madonna Street.") The Times's on-set report notes the proximity of Roberto Rossellini's current production, "Voyage to Italy." In his account of "Beat the Devil," Huston credits himself with Rossellini's strategy of giving his actors their lines moments before a scene was shot.
What had changed? The Bogart cult that began in Cambridge, Mass., in the late 1950s had gained traction. (Peter Bogdanovich published his report "Bogie in Excelsis" in the September 1964 issue of Esquire.) "Sick comedy" and "black humor" entered the mainstream. James Bond's gleeful irreverence took hold; "Dr. Strangelove" opened less than a month before "Beat the Devil" was reissued. The '60s were underway! "Camp" was a buzz word, although Susan Sontag's "Notes on Camp," which appeared in the fall of 1964, slagged "Beat the Devil" as a movie so desperate to be campy that it was "continually losing the beat."
In the mid-1970s, around the time the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" cult was attracting attention, Huston gave an interview maintaining that people had seen "Beat the Devil" multiple times, knew the dialogue by heart and would recite the lines along with the actors. I find that hard to imagine -- but no more so than that critics and audiences in 1954 failed to appreciate "Beat the Devil" for the charming jape that is.
"Beat the Devil" can be found on YouTube and streamed through Amazon Prime.

Texto completo: After a stretch of disastrous years that included a recession, a debt crisis, bankruptcy, a hurricane and the exodus of thousands of residents from the island, 2019 is shaping up to be a good year for Puerto Rico - or at least for Puerto Rican morale.
Several things came together, mostly by chance, to lift the island's spirits and give Puerto Ricans a sense of hope. That is due, in important measure, to two New York Puerto Ricans, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who have brought the world's attention to the island.
Miranda's rise to fame in the U.S. was meteoric, and earlier this year he reflected some of that glory back onto his family's homeland with a three-week staging of "Hamilton" in San Juan. The production lured thousands of American and international visitors to the island in January and raised $14 million for Puerto Rican artists and arts institutions. It ended with an epic final performance, after which Miranda tearfully wrapped himself in the Puerto Rican flag and brought down the house.
And then there's Ocasio-Cortez, who also has Puerto Rican parents and has had her own phenomenal rise to celebrity, culminating with her swearing in as a U.S. congresswoman in January. She has not visited the island since 2016 but has called for the end to the territory's colonial status and was photographed holding up the Puerto Rican flag.
Her upset victory over a high-ranking incumbent Anglo congressman made her an instant hit in her ancestral home. "Love her or hate her, the way she has carried herself reflects well on Puerto Rico," said San Juan attorney and Democratic Party insider Andres W. Lopez. Now, he said, he is waiting to see whether Ocasio-Cortez highlights issues that involve Puerto Rico directly.
The limelight associated with Puerto Rico's famous progeny, a group that also includes Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, has arguably already brought some benefit to the island. The New York Times, for example, recently named Puerto Rico the world's No. 1 travel destination for 2019, something hotel consultant Simon Baeyertz says represents a real achievement, and not simply a "pity party for the hurricane."
But leveraging the recent feel-good moments for long-term benefit will take far more.
The bankrupt island is operating under the strict oversight of a federal fiscal panel, which has brought punishing austerity measures. Unemployment is at 8.3 percent, more than double the U.S. rate overall, and 44 percent live below the poverty line.
The island has to reckon too with an inept and corrupt system of patronage and an overdependence on government jobs and welfare.
On the plus side are attractive tax incentives for investors, affordable property values, a spate of economic activity related to hurricane rebuilding (with $1.5 billion in federal block grants for recovery on the way), and a general sense that the bottom has been hit.
Tourism is the most visible sign of better times. Old San Juan is again busy with visitors. Quaint hill towns and beaches in Isabela, Rincon, and Vieques also report increased tourism. And new, high-end boutique hotels are opening in the hot spot Condado district, known as one of the Caribbean's "capitals of cool."
"In a way, it's as if the hurricane has connected the island with the mainland in a way I have never felt," said Baeyertz.
The trick now will be strengthening that connection. For more than a century, Puerto Rico has had a complicated relationship with the United States. Though Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, those living in the island territory cannot vote in federal elections. They also do not pay federal taxes. The island receives less federal aid per capita for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and hurricane recovery than states do.
Many Puerto Ricans consider statehood the only answer to their island's woes. Last year, Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo Rossello, sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to support the island becoming a state and to abandon "territorial-colonialism." But advocates haven't successfully carried the fight to the U.S. Congress, which has the final say, and where statehood for Puerto Rico is neither urgent nor favored.
Some Puerto Ricans hope that high-profile Puerto Ricans on the mainland will help - as will the 5.1 million Puerto Ricans who live on the mainland and can help swing elections in some areas.
"After spending decades as outsiders, in the margins of American society, the fact that everywhere you look in 2019, Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans are in the thick of it - that is welcome indeed," Lopez told me. "All of these developments have something in common: They place Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans squarely in the middle of the national conversation."

Texto completo: Native American author Tommy Orange, of Oakland, has won the prestigious 2019 PEN/Hemingway award for "distinguished first novel."
The honor was announced March 19 by PEN America, a project of the Hemingway Society created after the death of Ernest Hemingway.
Orange, a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, wrote his debut novel, "There There," about modern-day native Americans struggling with loss of identity in urban Oakland.
Published by Knopf in 2018, the novel was rated by the New York Times as one of the best books of the year.
"After noticing a lack of stories about urban Native Americans, Orange created a remarkable work that explores those who have inherited a profound spirituality, but who are also plagued by addiction, abuse, and suicide," says a biography on the Penguin Random House Speakers Bureau website.
In a June 2018 Bay Area News Group review of the book and interview with Orange, Lisa Wrenn wrote: "His love for Oakland and its people is obvious in his book's broad cast of characters, who are introduced in eponymously titled chapters that read like standalone stories.
Like Orange himself, the characters are biracial, with names like Orvil Red Feather, Edwin Black and Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield.
"Oakland itself serves as a character, drawn in such details as the characters' allegiance to the A's and Raiders, the whiff of cannabis smoke at the bus station and the faded pink glow of the Tribune Tower, which seems like it should be red, but somehow lost steam along the way.' "
Regarding the book's title, she writes: "Orange draws parallels between the identity issues facing Oakland and the Native Americans who are nearly invisible' here. When Dene applies for an arts grant, he's interviewed by a smirky, hipster judge, Rob, who tells Dene: No one's really from (Oakland), right?' Rob goes on to parrot the oft-misinterpreted Gertrude Stein quote, there's no there there.' "
The PEN/Hemingway comes with a $25,000 award from the Hemingway Family and the Hemingway Foundation. Orange also will receive a month-long residency fellowship at the Ucross Foundation, a Wyoming retreat for artists and writers.
Séan Hemingway, the grandson of Ernest Hemingway, will present Orange with the award during an April 7 ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.

The sentences on the other side of the bars

Texto completo: Liza Jessie Peterson had already been teaching poetry at Rikers Island, New York City's main jail complex, when her boyfriend violated parole. He was incarcerated, and she entered the hidden world of prison visitors. That new perspective on the correctional system led to her play, "The Peculiar Patriot," which begins a three-week run at the Woolly Mammoth Theatre on Monday.
"This was around 2000," Peterson recalls. "I came to Columbus Circle at midnight and found a whole fleet of buses. All these women, children and even some men were boarding these buses to go to the upstate correctional facilities. They would ride all night, go through a long, degrading security process, just to spend a few hours with their loved ones, before taking the bus home. As I talked to those women, I knew I was witnessing one of the great love stories of our time. A writer friend said, 'You know, you have a profound story to tell, so tell it.' "
Peterson not only wrote this one-person play, but she also performs it (under the direction of Talvin Wilks). The show opens with Betsy, an incarcerated Black Panther's daughter, who was raised by her grandmother. She's trying to claw her way out of poverty via education, political awareness and the arts, but she has no desire to separate from the people she grew up with. She proves it by taking long bus rides to visit them in various prisons. Changing yourself without changing your allegiance to those closest to you is a difficult trick to pull off, and for Betsy, the challenge is personified by her romantic interests, Pablo and Curtis.
"Curtis is a recovering addict," Peterson explains, "while Pablo is a former dealer. Betsy believes in second chances; she believes in redemption. But she doesn't want to be with someone who's doing something that's hurting the community."
In a phone call during rehearsals in Washington, Peterson quotes Malcolm X: "To have once been a criminal is no disgrace, but to remain one is a disgrace."
"Therein lies that theme of redemption," Peterson adds. "That's where Betsy is coming from." The more she reads about the "prison-industrial complex," the more she is willing to view Curtis as a victim as much as a victimizer. And when he goes back to school and starts writing poetry, she's willing to give him a second chance.
"I just wanted to show that this is a relationship no different from any other relationship," Peterson says, "but they work it out differently because he's behind bars. Curtis represents how love relationships with someone behind bars are navigated - through phone calls, letters, visits. There are going to be fights. You love someone, but they do something awful; you get angry at them and you decide whether or not you can forgive them."
Peterson graduated from Georgetown University and was a fashion model in Paris before she wound up as an actress living on Manhattan's Lower East Side, a few blocks from the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, ground zero for the nascent slam-poetry scene in the mid-1990s. A friend who read some of Peterson's journals recommended that she recite some of them as poems at the nearby cafe.
She started getting paid to read her poetry at colleges and elsewhere. She made two appearances on HBO's "Def Poetry" series, and she published a book, "All Day: A Year of Love and Survival Teaching Incarcerated Kids at Rikers Island." She was even interviewed about Rikers for Ava DuVernay's documentary "13th."
Peterson noticed that many of her poems were written in the voices of other people and realized that they could be turned into plays. She performed "The Peculiar Patriot" at 35 prisons across the country before the New York Times reviewed its "premiere," in 2017, at the National Black Theater in Harlem.
"When I read about the similarities between slavery and mass incarceration," she says, explaining her title, "I remembered that slavery was called the 'peculiar institution' in the antebellum South. I thought of the word 'patriot,' because all those family members at Columbus Circle at midnight were patriots of the peculiar institution of mass incarceration. The more than 2 million people incarcerated in the United States are enough for a small country, and these are the patriots of that mini-nation."

Texto completo: After two years of intense anticipation and speculation, the findings of the Mueller Report are finally in: President Trump did not collude with the Russians.
The headline in the New York Times on Monday, March 25 read, “Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy,” the Washington Post declared, “Mueller finds no conspiracy,” and the Wall Street Journal printed, “Mueller finds no Trump collusion.”
In spite of all of that, on Tuesday, March 26, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying, “Undoubtedly, there is collusion…We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues.”
In another interview with “ABC This Week,” Schiff said that there is “still significant evidence of collusion” and that “there’s a difference between compelling evidence of collusion and whether the special counsel concludes that he can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the criminal charge of conspiracy.”
Okay, then.
Either they don’t deliver the papers to Burbank, or Schiff is prepared to accept the Mueller Report the same way he accepted the results of the 2016 presidential election.
Not at all.
Schiff is like one of those Japanese soldier hold-outs they found on a Pacific island 30 years after World War II ended, still carrying on the fight. Long after Trump and Melania and Ivanka are dead and buried, Schiff will be demanding that President Barron Trump answer a few more questions about the Steele dossier.
At first glance it’s easy to assume that Schiff is pretty dense, and think “how did in the world did he even get on the Intelligence Committee in the first place? Did his parents pay someone a half-million dollar bribe?”
But don’t make the mistake of thinking that he’s stupid.
On the contrary, Schiff is a malicious grifter who has recklessly peddled this provably false conspiracy theory for years, and can’t muster up the courage to admit that he’s wrong.
Schiff’s incessant collusion theories have gotten him so much coverage on cable news he’s been on MSNBC more often than the inmates on “Lockup.”
Here’s just a sampling of some of his greatest hits…
In March of 2017, Schiff said on Meet the Press that there was “circumstantial evidence of collusion” and “direct evidence… of deception.”
Also in March, Schiff told MSNBC there was “more than circumstantial evidence” — and claimed that had seen it.
On December 14, 2017, Schiff told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, “Well, look, there’s clear evidence of an attempt to collude.”
On March 1, 2018, Megan McCain of ABC’s “The View” asked Schiff, “Last March you said you have more than circumstantial evidence of treasonous collusion with Russia. What specifically were you referring to? And please be specific because if it’s true I do believe Americans have the right to know a year later what that is.”
In response, Schiff gave a rambling answer that referenced George Papadapolous, Donald Trump Jr., and a meeting at Trump Tower.
When he was finished, McCain said, “I just think if Mueller doesn’t end up charging him, it just looks like a lot of smoke and mirrors.”
On May 27, 2018 he told “ABC This Week,” that of the Russia investigation, “I think, of a size and scope possibly beyond Watergate.”
On August 5, 2018 he told “CBS This Morning,” “I think there’s plenty of evidence of collusion.”
For two years, Schiff would tell anyone who would listen that President Trump colluded with the Russians, and now we know for a fact, that he was full of it the whole time.
A charlatan like this doesn’t belong anywhere near the Intelligence Committee, let alone as its chairman.
For heaven’s sake, Megan McCain made him look like a fool on The View. That alone should get him kicked off the Intelligence Committee.
At this point, I think it’s obvious that a con artist like Congressman Schiff doesn’t have the character to apologize to President Trump or to the American people; so it’s up to his colleagues to remove him as chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays at 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

1962: The Bumbling Beginning

Texto completo: The original Mets were created from the ashes of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, both of whom had deserted New York City after the 1957 season. Now, five years later, National League baseball was back, so to speak. For it was quickly apparent that the Mets' roster, put together mostly from players left unprotected by the other National League teams, was a mess.
Left to do the best he could with it was baseball's most colorful manager, Casey Stengel, who had won seven World Series with the Yankees but had been dismissed after the 1960 season, at the age of 70, because the Yankees felt he was too old. Now, he was even older, but on the Mets that hardly mattered because they had plenty of players past their prime.
Stengel, with his amusing, and endless, observations became the perfect narrator for a season of amazingly bad baseball. It began with nine straight losses and by its close, the Mets had won just 40 games and lost 120, the most defeats in a single season in the modern history of baseball.
Adding to the absurdity was that the Mets had two pitchers named Bob Miller -- Righty Bob Miller and Lefty Bob Miller. And a first baseman known as Marvelous Marv Throneberry, with the Marvelous meant as a joke, not a compliment.
On it went right up to the last day of the season, when the Mets managed to hit into a triple play. By then, as Robert Lipsyte of The New York Times put it, they had become an international symbol of incompetence.
Following are excerpts from Times articles during the 1962 season:
ST. LOUIS, April 11
The First Defeat, With 119 to Follow
History was made tonight by the New York Mets. They broke into the expanded National League at long last, but wound up on the short end of an 11-4 score, beaten conclusively by the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium.
In their first official effort, the Mets unfortunately did much to beat themselves. Despite the 16 hits the Cardinals collected, four ineffective New York pitchers, backed by a loose defense, hurt the Mets immeasurably.
The season opener here before 16,147 half-frozen fans saw the Mets commit three errors and permit three stolen bases.
Adding to Manager Casey Stengel's miseries, Roger Craig, the starter and losing pitcher, committed a balk that led to one of two St. Louis runs in the first inning. In addition, the Mets bounced into two double plays. LOUIS EFFRAT
POLO GROUNDS, April 13
A Home Opener on Friday the 13th
Civic pride erupted in one lusty ovation after another at the Polo Grounds today as 12,447 baseball fans hailed the return of the prodigal National League.
In the eye of the hurricane of hurrahs were the New York Mets -- a team conceived in frustration and dedicated to the proposition that this teeming metropolis is a two-league town as well as a summer festival.
Murky skies, autumn temperatures and a relentless drizzle kept the welcoming committee from reaching major league proportions.
However, what the crowd lacked in numbers it offset with enthusiasm, generously pouring out affection that had found no satisfactory outlet since the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers absconded to the West Coast at the close of the 1957 season.
Of those present on this historic Friday the 13th, only the Pittsburgh Pirates extended anything except felicitations and best wishes to Casey Stengel's Mets. And despite profound cogitation and adroit personnel shuffling by the former Yankee manager, the Pirates won, 4-3. ROBERT TEAGUE
CHICAGO, June 8
No Mets Team Loses 18 Times in a Row
After 17 consecutive defeats, the New York Mets today emerged from the darkness by beating the Chicago Cubs, 4-3, in the first game of a doubleheader at Wrigley Field.
To Mets fans, the fact that the Cubs retaliated with a 3-2 victory in the second game, which was called after eight innings because of darkness, doesn't matter. Neither does the fact that the Mets' triumph came on an unearned run in the ninth inning. After 17 losses, a victory is a victory. Jay Hook, who needed last-inning relief by Craig Anderson, was the winning pitcher in the opener. He is the same right-hander who snapped the nine-game losing string with which the Mets opened the season.
Not since May 20, when they twice upended the Milwaukee Braves, had the Mets known victory. It was the longest losing streak ever for a New York team in the major leagues. LOUIS EFFRAT
POLO GROUNDS, SEPT. 22
Drumbeat of Defeat Remains Relentless
Even in the autumn of their pathetic despair, the New York Mets cannot escape history. Each step and misstep seem destined to remain forever in the dusty recesses of major league archives, or at least in corner crevices in the minds of those who care.
Today, at the Polo Grounds, there were at least four such footnotes to baseball's memorabilia. They obscured the Mets' 116th defeat, a dreary 9-2 drubbing by the Chicago Cubs.
The saddest of the four is what Met officials disregard as a "negative statistic." Al Jackson, one of the two best pitchers on the club, was clobbered for five runs on seven hits during the two and a third innings he pitched.
The slim left-hander was charged with his 20th loss of the season in 28 decisions. This is the first time since 1936 that a National League club has had two 20-game losers. Roger Craig, the other one, has a 9-23 won-lost record.
The Philadelphia Phillies turned the trick 26 years ago when Bucky Walters lost 21 and Joe Bowman 20. ROBERT LIPSYTE
MILWAUKEE, SEPT. 26
With Loss No. 118, The Mets Set a Record
Shed another tear for the New York Mets, who bowed, 6-3, to the Braves tonight and wound up with exclusive rights to another record, asterisk, footnote and all.
Casey Stengel's men suffered their 118th defeat. This negative statistic made the Mets the losingest baseball team in modern history. The Philadelphia Athletics of 1916 lost 117 games.
The game drew only 3,239 fans, the smallest night-game turnout since the Braves moved to Milwaukee. Play was delayed 42 minutes after the top of the first inning because of rain.
With Henry Aaron's three-run homer off Roger Craig supplying the crusher in the third, and the 23-year-old southpaw Denny Lemaster striking out 10 Mets, this was just another night in a long series of sorry nights for the first-year club. Craig, who departed for a pinch-hitter in the fourth, hung around long enough to absorb his 24th setback. LOUIS EFFRAT
CHICAGO, SEPT. 30
Loss No. 120: Mets Reach the End of the Woe
It mattered not that the New York Mets won or lost, or even how they played the game today before 3,960 fans at Wrigley Field. For the record, though, the season's final, for which Casey Stengel asked and obtained volunteers, went to the Cubs, 5-1.
It was the Mets' 120th defeat in this, their initial campaign, and it left them in the National League cellar, 60 games from the top. The season was concluded as it had started -- with a setback -- after the Mets had been victimized by an eighth-inning triple play.
Had the season been fun?
"I would have to say no to that one," Stengel said. LOUIS EFFRAT
Editors' note: The 1962 Mets hold the record for most losses in a season in modern Major League Baseball history.

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice. What's wrong with that? Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said.
"If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. The survey was conducted between Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.

Texto completo: Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi bring funny vampires to FX. And Reinaldo Marcus Green's "Monsters and Men" is streaming on Hulu.
What's on TV
WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS 10 p.m. on FX. Are Staten Island vampires any different than New Zealand vampires? Fans of the 2015 mockumentary "What We Do in the Shadows" are about to find out. The funny Kiwis Jemaine Clement (of Flight of the Conchords) and Taika Waititi (the director of "Thor: Ragnarok") have taken that movie, which they directed, and turned it into a TV series of the same name. The series trades the Wellington vampire roommates of the film for a group of ancient bloodsuckers struggling to adjust to life on Staten Island. But its laughs tend to come from the same source as the film's: mainly, the vampires' tendency toward human folly. "Humans are so [expletive] stupid and boring and lazy that given the gift of immortality, you'd never get around to doing anything," Waititi recently told The New York Times. "You'd just put off everything. People that have been alive for 5,000 years, going: 'I've got forever to learn how to play violin. Why start now?"'
What's Streaming
MONSTERS AND MEN (2018) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. John David Washington may have been most visible in 2018 as a Ku Klux Klan-infiltrating police officer in Spike Lee's "BlacKkKlansman," but that wasn't his only leading role last year. In this debut feature from the writer and director Reinaldo Marcus Green, Washington plays Dennis, an African-American officer in New York who struggles with knowledge of his squad's racism. He makes up about a third of the narrative here, alongside the "Hamilton" actor Anthony Ramos as a Brooklyn father who witnesses a police shooting and Kelvin Harrison Jr., who plays a teenage baseball star turned activist. As their stories play off one another and the political heat rises, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times, "the movie stays cool, its smooth, smart climax in keeping with its levelheaded tone."
GET OUT (2017) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. When Jordan Peele came out with this searing freakout comedy, audiences still knew him best as half of the sketch comedy duo Key & Peele -- not as an auteur of socially attuned horror films. That side of Peele, evident in his new blockbuster, "Us," first blossomed with this tale of Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a young black photographer who goes on a weekend trip to the hometown of his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams).
MEEK'S CUTOFF (2011) Stream on Amazon, Hulu and Kanopy; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Michelle Williams stars in this slow burning, pre-Civil War western. Directed by the indie filmmaker Kelly Reichardt ("Wendy and Lucy"), it follows a group of wagon-riding settlers traveling through the Oregon desert. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott called the film "a bracingly original foray into territory that remains, in every sense, unsettled."

Texto completo: Headnote The challenge Black women face when they accuse Black men
When Meredith Watson decided to publicly accuse. Virginia's lieutenant governor of raping her, she knew she would face a backlash - most women who accuse powerful men of sexual assault do.
But she also feared that as a Black woman, she would face added scrutiny because the prominent politician she named, Justin E. Fairfax, was African American, too.
"You're not supposed to betray your race," Watson, 39, said in her first interview since she accused Fairfax last month of assaulting her when they were in college together at Duke University nearly two decades ago. Fairfax has denied her allegations.
The #MeToo movement has brought into the open the challenges all women face when they say they have been sexually assaulted. Their accusations are disbelieved. Their motives are questioned. Their pasts are examined.
But Black women can face added blowback, including suggestions from other African Americans that they are being disloyal to their race by calling out prominent men among them.
The allegations against Fairfax have spurred fresh conversations about how society treats Black women who say they have been sexually assaulted.
Similar discussions have flared around an entirely separate case involving R&B singer R. Kelly. Kelly was charged with 10 counts of sexual abuse last month, allegations he has denied. Though the two cases have little in common, they both highlight the challenges facing Black women.
Fairfax, who maintains that he had a consensual sexual encounter with Watson, said in a statement that it was also important to consider the injustices that Black men have been subjected to in America.
"As a matter of general principle, no one should challenge the fact that African-American women have been marginalized regarding sexual assault claims," Fairfax said in the statement. "Nor should anyone challenge the fact that African-American men have been the targets of false allegations of sexual assault, whoever the accuser. We need a justice system that treats both accusers and the accused fairly and affords both due process."
Watson said she came forward in part as an act of solidarity with Vanessa Tyson, another Black woman, who has accused Fairfax of sexually assaulting her during an encounter at the Democratic National Convention in Boston in 2004. (A spokeswoman for Tyson said she was unavailable to comment. Fairfax has denied her allegations.)
Watson said she has received some support, but the condemnation has stung.
After she came forward, Watson said, a Black male friend told her he could not believe she was "going to do this to a Black man."
On social media, strangers described her as opportunistic, dismissed her as a pawn to take down Fairfax and equated her to the white woman who falsely accused Emmett Till of flirting with her, leading to his lynching in 1955.
"I feel like I've been torn apart the most by my own community, quite frankly," Watson said. "As Black women, we shouldn't have to keep going through this and bearing it in silence and just feeling like these things can happen to us."
There are a variety of underlying reasons for this desire to sometimes give Black men a break, experts say. Distrust in the criminal justice system is part of it. So is the acknowledgment that Black men face considerable hurdles on their way toward success. The underlying sentiment is similar to the hesitancy of some Black residents to call 911 on other Black people: Will they get a fair shake?
"Coming forward against a Black man who is liked by his community, I don't know if anything is as difficult as that in terms of a situation a survivor can be in," said Saida Grundy, an African-American, women's and gender studies professor at Boston University who has written about the subject.
Successful Black men are seen as exceptional, she said, and so "tarnishing them with allegations is somehow a betrayal to Black people who have made it."
Fairfax, a Democrat, has called for a law enforcement investigation to clear his name, asserting that Watson was part of an effort to prevent him from succeeding Gov. Ralph Northam, who faced pressure to resign after admitting to wearing blackface.
Watson said she would testify at a public hearing. Leaders in the Republican-controlled Virginia Legislature have said they would hold a public hearing, but it is not clear when.
One of those standing by Fairfax has invoked the ugly history of Black men being falsely accused as a reason to question the accusations against him.
"There have been just too many false charges filed against Black men," said Marty Jewell, a former Richmond, Virginia, city councilman who, along with other older Black civic leaders, criticized what he felt was a rush to judgment against Fairfax. "We do know that women, through their scorn, have made false charges against men to get even."
Those types of attitudes and the suggestion that Black women have a responsibility toward Black men have made Aliyah Young, a Chicago activist who works at A Long Walk Home, an organization focused on empowering Black women and girls, hesitant to publicly discuss her own experience of being sexually assaulted by a Black high school classmate, she said.
She said she has cut short family dinners and blocked people on social media when they started to blame Black women for their own victimization in the Kelly case.
Young often protests police abuse against Black people, which factored into her decision not to call out her own attacker. "If I'm about the Black agenda, I can't go against Black people," said Young, 17, now a freshman at DePaul University.
More than 4 in 10 Black women experience physical violence from an intimate partner during their lifetimes, according to a report by the Institute for Women's Policy Research.
Yet research suggests that Black women may be less likely to report being sexually assaulted to the police because of negative experiences with law enforcement; prosecutors may be less likely to bring charges when sexual assault victims are Black in certain situations, and jurors may be less likely to convict, studies suggest.
Roughly 20 years ago, Lisa VanAllen, 38, accused Kelly of coaxing her into group sex when she was a minor.
She was the prosecution's main witness against Kelly during the decade-old trial in which he was acquitted of child pornography charges. During that time, VanAllen said, most criticism came from other Black people.
"No one was checking to see if I was OK," she said. "I got no compassion."
That was an attitude that needed to change, said Grundy, the Boston University professor.
"We have to ask ourselves, if the cost of not bringing a good brother down is always silencing the Black woman, then what the hell kind of racial progress is that?" she said. "You don't make progress on half the race."

Newly retired UFC fighter Conor McGregor under investigation for sexual assault in Ireland

Texto completo: Mixed martial artist Conor McGregor is being investigated by Irish police for an alleged sexual assault that occurred in Dublin in December.

According to a report by the New York Times, McGregor, who is Irish, is the "unnamed sportsman" who is being investigated for a sexual assault that allegedly occurred at Dublin's Beacon Hotel in December. McGregor is reportedly a frequent visitor of the hotel, renting out the hotel's only penthouse suite when staying.

Irish law prevents media from identifying those accused of rape until they're convicted, leading to the suspect and the victim being anonymous until the conclusion of the case, but sources said McGregor was arrested in January and released after questioning by police, which is not unusual for Irish proceedings in which charges do not always immediately follow detention.

McGregor, who famously lost a 2017 boxing match to undefeated champion Floyd Mayweather Jr., announced his retirement from the Ultimate Fighting Championship and mixed martial arts early Tuesday morning with a tweet calling it the "sport formally known as 'Mixed Martial Art.'"

"Hey guys quick announcement, I’ve decided to retire from the sport formally known as 'Mixed Martial Art' today," McGregor tweeted. "I wish all my old colleagues well going forward in competition. I now join my former partners on this venture, already in retirement. Proper Pina Coladas on me fellas!"

McGregor briefly retired in spring 2016 and his tweet Tuesday morning was met with skepticism by followers.

McGregor's spokeswoman, Karen Kessler, put out a statement Tuesday, saying, "The assumption that the Conor retirement announcement today is related to this rumor is absolutely false."

Investigators are reportedly in possession of closed-circuit TV footage of McGregor and evidence from the room in which he was staying. Irish newsrooms sent out internal memos instructing employees how to discuss the situation without naming McGregor specifically.

McGregor also faces criminal charges in the United States after being arrested in Miami Beach in March after he slapped a cellphone out of the hand of someone trying to take his picture and smashing the cellphone. He was charged with strong-armed robbery and criminal mischief.

Media pat themselves on the back following implosion of the collusion news cycle

Texto completo: If you are hoping for an industrywide reckoning in the press following the implosion of the Russian collusion news cycle, you’re going to be sorely disappointed.

Media executives are not just unashamed of how their employees have covered this story for the last two years, they are proud of them.

CNN President Jeff Zucker, for example, has defended his network’s disastrously flawed coverage of the allegations that President Trump conspired with the Russian government to steal the 2016 presidential election, by claiming his reporters are not investigators. This is not a paraphrase.

"We are not investigators," Zucker said. "We are journalists, and our role is to report the facts as we know them, which is exactly what we did.”

During the entirety of the Russian collusion news cycle, which began in earnest around mid-2016, CNN’s contributions to the story teetered consistently between extremely dubious and outright false.

In 2017, three staffers quit after the network retracted a story alleging longtime Trump ally Anthony Scaramucci had ties to a $10 billion Russian investment fund owned by a Kremlin-connected bank. Later that same year, the network falsely reported that former Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not disclose Russia meetings on a security clearance form. CNN also repeated the almost certainly bogus charge that former FBI Director James Comey was fired shortly after requesting additional resources for the Russia investigation. In 2018, CNN was forced to issue a series of embarrassing on-air corrections after it falsely reported that Trump and his inner circle received advance notice during the 2016 presidential election of WikiLeaks' plans to dump thousands of hacked emails belonging to Democratic National Committee staffers and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which included 40 agents, 2,800 subpoenas, some 500 search warrants, and 500 witness interviews, has concluded it could not “establish that the members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” Attorney General William Barr announced this weekend. Barr also said there is no evidence “to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”

Over at the Washington Post, which helped launch this entire Kremlin collusion narrative by falsely claiming in 2016 that Russian operatives hacked a Vermont utility, executive editor Marty Baron sounded a similarly proud and defiant note.

"The special counsel investigation documented, as we reported, extensive Russian interference in the 2016 election and widespread deceit on the part of certain advisers to the president about Russian contacts and other matters,” said Baron. “Our job is to bring facts to light. Others make determinations about prosecutable criminal offenses.”

Like CNN, the Post also reported the extremely unlikely charge that Comey was fired after he requested additional resources for his Russia investigation. The paper also claimed, without evidence, that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein “threatened to resign” after a “narrative” emerged that he orchestrated Comey’s firing. Rosenstein has denied the story, which hinges entirely on the say-so of anonymous sources. The Post is also the proud steward of an archive of once major scoops that, in retrospect, don’t amount to much at all, including the supposed 2017 bombshell alleging federal officials had identified a top White House official as being a "person of interest" in the FBI's Russia investigation.

Lastly, there’s New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet, whose paper shares a Pulitzer Prize with the Post for its coverage of a story that ended with a big nothing. Like Baron and Zucker, Baquet is very proud of the work his reporters have done covering a collusion story that concluded this weekend with the special counsel saying it couldn’t find any evidence of collusion.

“We wrote a lot about Russia, and I have no regrets,” he said. "It is never our job to determine illegality, but to expose the actions of people in power. And that's what we and others have done and will continue to do."

The Times falsely reported in 2017 that Trump campaign officials had colluded with Russian intelligence agents during the 2016 election. Comey himself refuted this story during a hearing before Congress, saying the allegation “was not true.” The Times also reported incorrectly that year that former deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland conceded in a private email that Russia tipped the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favor. McFarland herself did not say that. She was paraphrasing Democratic criticisms of the Trump administration. The Times also repeated a leftover Clinton 2016 campaign talking point throughout 2017 when it reported inaccurately that “all 17 intelligence agencies agreed Moscow interfered in the U.S. election to get him elected.” Let's not forget the time the newspaper reported former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had referred to himself in a tweet as “the sole scapegoat for what happened." Flynn never tweeted that. It was a parody Twitter account.

I could go on with additional examples from either of the aforementioned newsrooms, but you get the picture.

Great work all around, team.

What Mueller's report reveals: Collusion by media, not Trump

Texto completo: The mountain has labored and brought forth a mouse. After two years of hype, special counsel Robert Mueller has reported to Attorney General William Barr that there was no "collusion," as Donald Trump would put it, between Trump or the Trump presidential campaign and the Russians regarding the 2016 election.
There will be no new indictments from Mueller beyond the few already issued, none of which charges a U.S. person with anything related to collusion. This is a big disappointment to the people in politics and the press who were openly hoping to see Trump, and his family, kicked out of the White House and thrown into jail.
And there were a lot of those people, as Grabien editor Tom Elliott noted last week:
In December 2017, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski said the Trump team might be going to jail "for the rest of their lives."
Last December, CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Delaware Sen. Chris Coons – as he often does – whether he thought Trump might be facing jail time. Coons said yes, "the issues outlined against both Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, I think, continue to sharpen the ways in which it is clear that the Mueller investigation has produced a whole series of actions not previously exposed to the public."
Also in December, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Trump could be the first president "to face the real prospect of jail time."
In April 2017, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said the evidence he had already seen suggested "people will probably go to jail."
Actually, it was always a crock, dreamed up immediately after Hillary Clinton's election-night defeat by her staff to explain away failure. As reported in the campaign book "Shattered," by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, Clinton refused to take responsibility for her defeat, and the day after her concession, top officials gathered "to engineer the case that the election wasn't entirely on the up-and-up. ... Already, Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument."
Though this was a matter of record – the book was hardly obscure – the news media chose to run with the Russia story, which quickly morphed from "hacking" to the more nebulous "collusion," quite credulously. They did so because they wanted it to be true, because they hoped it would hurt Trump, whom the press almost universally despises, and because it was good for ratings and clicks.
The irony, of course, is that while purporting to worry about Russian interference in American politics, by advancing this story the press was actually doing the work of President Vladimir Putin, sowing division and confusion through the American polity.
As former Clinton pollster Mark Penn tweeted, we wasted two years, at least $30million and a lot of institutional credibility at the FBI and Department of Justice over "a false story of Russia collusion based on oppo research that was always unsubstantiated and preposterous."
Liberal journalist Matt Taibbi was even harsher, calling the Russia-collusion story WMD times a million. Taibbi noted that the news media's credibility is a major victim:
Nothing Trump is accused of from now on by the press will be believed by huge chunks of the population, a group that (perhaps thanks to this story) is now larger than his original base. As Peter Baker of the New York Times notes, a full 50.3percent of respondents in a poll conducted this month said they agree with Trump the Mueller probe is a "witch hunt."
Well, that's because it was. Leftist journalist Glenn Greenwald administered a Twitter beat-down to some of his colleagues in the news media, saying: "If you constantly went on TV or wrote things to mislead millions into believing Mueller was coming to arrest Trump, Jr., Jared and a whole slew of others for conspiring with the Russians, just admit it. Save yourselves the embarrassment of all this whitewashing & pretending."
Don't expect any such apologies.
We might someday need a press we can trust. But I hope not, because we certainly don't have one.
So what's next? Well, there may not have been Russian collusion, but there certainly was collusion between FBI agents and journalists, with agents leaking information and journalists paying them off with "tickets to sporting events, golfing outings, drinks and meals, and admittance to nonpublic social events," according to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice.
And the connections between the Justice Department and the political opposition-research firm Fusion GPS (where the wife of senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr was paid to dig up dirt on Trump) were particularly egregious.
Roger Simon of of PJ Media writes that there is a lot of corruption yet to be investigated and prosecuted, on the part of Trump's accusers: "It was a conspiracy and, worse yet, a conspiracy ignited and carried out from within the FBI and the Department of Justice. Nothing could be more dangerous to a democratic society than that. How high this conspiracy went is still somewhat unclear. I say 'somewhat' because the likelihood of it having reached into the White House of the previous administration is great. It's hard to imagine how it could have happened otherwise."
Will we see any accountability for the many ethical – and probably legal – breaches involving Trump's bureaucratic opposition? Stay tuned. But the "Russian collusion" narrative has now imploded.

Texto completo: Watch: Senator Elizabeth Warren talks to Stephen Colbert
During an interview Monday with Stephen Colbert of “The Late Show," Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that without the release of Robert Mueller's full report on Russia, she does not trust Attorney General William Barr's assessment that President Trump did not obstruct justice.
Host Stephen Colbert, who began Monday's show with a monologue about the other investigations into Trump, framed his question to Warren with a mention of her legal credentials — he asked the longtime law professor if she trusted Barr's judgement on obstruction of justice.
“No," Warren, a presidential hopeful, replied. “And you shouldn't have to ask me if I trust it. We should see the whole report. When we see the whole report, we'll know what the basis is for the decision."
Barr released Sunday a four-page summary of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, in which Barr declared that Trump did not obstruct justice.
The attorney general has not said if, or when, he might release Mueller's complete findings, but congressional Democrats, including Warren, have demanded to see the special counsel's full report.

Texto completo: Rodney Horgen frantically tried to grab his wife as a massive wall of water crashed into their crippled Norwegian cruise ship.
He counted 20 or more people riding the rapid water, along with chairs and tables: "I tried to grab her, but I just couldn't."
She whooshed by twice more on the rollicking ship before he was able to catch her.
Hours later, the couple from the tiny town of Deer River, Minn., were among several hundred passengers rescued from the Viking Sky and hoisted one by one to a helicopter.
"They looked like an angel coming to get ya," Horgen said Sunday, recalling when he saw the rescue crew lower the harness to him.
Horgen, 62, and his wife, Judy Lemieux, 66, were on a pilgrimage to Horgen's ancestral homeland aboard the Viking Sky, which left Bergen, Norway, on March 14 and was scheduled to arrive Tuesday on the River Thames in southeastern England.
It was carrying 1,373 passengers and crew when engine trouble struck in an unpredictable area of the Norwegian coast known for rough and frigid waters.
'Mayday' in English
The crew issued a mayday call Saturday afternoon, and the ordeal that swung from calm to terror was on.
"The swells were hitting us broadside, just leaning the ship back and forth, almost to the point we thought it was going to tip," Horgen said, recalling the scene in the seventh-floor restaurant early in the afternoon. "People were getting tipped over in their chairs" amid breaking dishes and glass.
Once the rocking motion eased a bit, everyone was ordered to their rooms before the captain announced in Norwegian with an occasional "mayday" in English that the ship needed to be evacuated.
All the tumult left at least 20 people injured, according to Viking Ocean Cruises, the company that owns and operates the ship.
Horgen escaped injury, as did Lemieux, even though she had been tossed about in the frigid seawater that swept onto the ship.
Horgen choked up a bit as he described his most difficult moment once he knew he and his wife were tapped to be rescued. Other than the injured being given priority, Horgen said he never learned why he and his wife were selected.
"Probably one of the hardest things I had to do was walk through this hallway where people were just waiting there, thinking like, 'You are the ones who get to get off,' " he said. "That was hard for me and my wife. It brought tears to our eyes."
The couple, retired chiropractors, recounted the ordeal in a phone interview from their hotel room in Norway. From their room, they could see their battered cruise ship docked nearby. It had taken six tugboats to get it there.
Recalling the moment Lemieux was swept away, Horgen said they had been sent to their designated evacuation posts as the 47,800-ton ship teetered in the rough waters.
Then the extreme seesawing of the Viking Sky stopped. Things were calm as Horgen stood behind Lemieux as she sat on the floor.
That's when "all of a sudden, just to the right about 25-30 [feet] away, through a window or door came a wall of water 6 feet in height," Horgen said.
Lemieux said she lost all control in the force of the water.
"There was a chair coming at me with the legs," she recalled, "and I thought it was going to take my eyes out. Then Rod grabbed me."
Their rescue was not without its own peril, Horgen said, pointing out that the ship was "100 meters or less from the shoals, which would have torn us apart" if the gale-force winds had pushed the vessel just a bit closer to shore.
The cruise line paid for the couple's night in a hotel in Molde as well as their flight Monday back to Minnesota.
The ship's operators also offered the couple a free cruise.
"There's a good chance we'll take the same cruise," he said. "I'm confident in them."
Lemieux wasn't so certain. "I think I need some more time to think about it."

Kentucky politicians react to findings Trump didn't conspire with Russia

Texto completo: Kentucky's two Republican senators cheered Sunday after learning special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not uncover a conspiracy between President Donald Trump and the Russian government to influence the 2016 election.
Attorney General William Barr said in a 4-page letter to Congress that the probe — which has hounded the White House for more than two years — "did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it" worked with Russia to defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
"The special counsel's conclusions confirm the president's account that there was no effort by his campaign to conspire or coordinate with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election," Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, a key Trump ally in Washington, said in a statement to the Courier Journal.
Sen. Rand Paul mimed Trump and described the investigation as a "witch hunt" via social media. He said it was unfortunate that "partisan politics has paralyzed Washington" for the past two years.
"The report makes it clear nothing existed except in the fevered imaginations of partisans in politics and the media," Paul tweeted. "I hope the biased media learns their lesson, and Democrats are able to accept the undisputed facts and move on."
The Mueller investigation, according to the attorney general's summary, outlines an extensive plot by Russian intelligence to help Trump win the White House by using internet hacking, fake social media accounts and other stolen materials to sway U.S. voters.
Trump has on various occasions publicly disagreed with eight different U.S. intelligence agencies that have stated Russia meddled in the 2016 contest.
McConnell touched on those issues by expressing concerns about the foreign country's intelligence operation to interfere with U.S. elections. He said he will work with members of the Senate intelligence committee to address foreign interference against American institutions.
"Russia's ongoing efforts to interfere with our democracy are dangerous and disturbing," McConnell said, "and I welcome the special counsel's contributions to our efforts to understand better Russia's activities in this regard."
Barr's summary also disclosed that some of Trump's aides worked eagerly to benefit from that operation. At least half a dozen of Trump's aides who were charged in the investigation then lied to Congress, federal investigators and the public to downplay those connections.
The Mueller investigation has led to more than three-dozen separate indictments, including dozens of Russian nationals who were charged with hacking Democratic computers and spreading disinformation during the campaign.
Trump did not address those concerns in his initial comments after the letter's release. Instead, he lashed out at critics who have used the investigation to undermine his administration.
"After a long investigation, after so many people have been so badly hurt ... it was just announced there was no collusion with Russia, the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard," Trump told reporters on Sunday.
Mueller's report, however, did leave open a question of whether Trump interfered with the investigation. The attorney general said that while Mueller's probe "does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."
"We still don't know exactly what Trump campaign officials knew and did, even if they could not be successfully prosecuted for a crime," U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, Kentucky's lone Democrat in Washington, said in a statement Sunday. "That is why the full report and all underlying evidence must be released to the American people."
Yarmuth's comments echoed the party line of congressional Democratic leaders, who called for the full Mueller report to be publicly released.
In a joint statement Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the attorney general is known for his "bias" against the special counsel's investigation. The Democratic pair said Barr is "not a neutral observer" and cannot objectively comment on the report.
Yarmuth has been one of the fiercest Trump critics, especially when concerning the Russia investigation.
In 2017, he ripped Trump's eldest son in 2017 after The New York Times reported that emails revealed Donald Trump Jr. was eager to accept Russia's help during the 2016 campaign.
"These emails are clear and compelling evidence that Donald Trump Jr. conspired with a hostile foreign government in an attempt to influence our American election," Yarmuth tweeted at the time. "There must be consequences."
But Mueller's investigation, according to the attorney general's letter, concluded that no one from the Trump campaign worked with Russia despite receiving "multiple offers" of assistance from individuals connected to the country.
Yarmuth, who leads the House Budget Committee, did not address the letter's rebuke of the belief that there was collusion between Trump and Russia. Instead, the congressman echoed McConnell's concerns about outside influence on the 2016 presidential race.
"We must have a government-wide commitment to defend ourselves against further Russian electoral sabotage," Yarmuth said.
The letter is sure to give Trump and his supporters a much-needed political boost to counterpunch critics, who have used the two-year investigation to suggest his election was due to cooperating with foreign adversaries.
Trump's re-election campaign released a video on YouTube not long after Barr's letter, slamming opponents for cheering on a "hoax" investigation. The video features several Democratic lawmakers and party officials saying there is evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.
Other members of Kentucky's congressional delegation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Orchids star in New York Botanical Garden extravaganza

Texto completo: NEW YORK - It's like being hit with a ton of... blossoms.
"The Orchid Show: Singapore," the New York Botanical Garden's 17th annual orchid extravaganza, running through April 28, features the natural species and hybridized sensations of Southeast Asia - upward of 70 percent of the display in the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. Thousands of them, in hundreds of varieties and every conceivable - and inconceivable - shape, size and color.
The orchid, once an aristocratic rarity, now a ubiquity - you can buy them at Home Depot - is still the most unnatural-looking flower of the natural world, dizzying in its opulent, adamant oddity. And that's just one on its own.
"It's actually surpassed the poinsettia as the most horticulturally produced crop in the world," said Marc Hachadourian, senior curator of orchids at the New York Botanical Garden. "They're the pandas of the plant world - they're charismatic, they're colorful, they're engaging."
The botanical garden's partners on the show are Singapore Botanic Gardens, whose National Orchid Garden has the largest collection in the world, and Singapore's Gardens by the Bay, a green-themed entertainment attraction where the wedding party finale in "Crazy Rich Asians" was filmed.
Singapore, which at one time called itself a "garden city," now calls itself a "city within a garden." The orchid, mass-produced and energetically hybridized as a major export industry, is its national flower.
The ambassador of the orchid's new ubiquity is the Phalaenopsis, in a Calvin Klein-underwear white. Known as the grocery store orchid, it is widely, inexpensively available, and the lifestyle star of everything from luxury-condo advertising to wellness spas and supermarkets.
Toppled from the throne is the cattleya: the frilled grandmotherly orchid that forms the stuff of corsages. Proust is wearing one on his label in Jacques-Emile Blanche's famous portrait of 1892.
Because of the Phalaenopsis' clean, modern, broad-shouldered success, everyone is now trying their hands at orchids, losing their home-gardeners' fears as orchids lose their stigma as tricky plants to cultivate.
"I own a lady's slipper and a Phalaenopsis," said Dr. Michelle Montenegro, who was visiting the conservatory with a colleague, Dr. Alec Petrie. Montenegro got her orchids at last year's show. "They're actually alive," she said, with a surprised laugh, when asked about their health. She built a special window shelf for them. "The shelf is definitely helping," sheadded.
The garden's Singapore show has two major attractions. A pair of supertrees - 18-foot-tall steel armatures in the trunk-like and canopied shape of actual trees - are versions of the artificial Supertrees in a vast grove at Gardens by the Bay, which is the setting for the scene in "Crazy Rich Asians."
Singapore's Supertrees are over 160 feet tall, and skyways traverse the tops. They are also embedded with photovoltaic cells, which collect energy - like living trees - that is used to power nighttime light displays chorecgraphed to music. And they're swathed, head to toe, in extra-terrestrial-looking foliage.
"It's sort of a Disneyland for plant lovers," said Karen Daubmann, associate vice president for exhibitions, who visited Gardens by the Bay, and worked to replicate the supertrees in the Bronx. "The orchids that we're showcasing inside, at the conservatory, are things they grow outside. It's pretty wild."
Like the ones in Singapore, the garden's supertrees were designed to demonstrate a particularly spectacular class of specimens, even for the tropics: epiphytes, or plants that grow without soil, on trees.
"They're a strange community that evolved to essentially climb the trees to get the best available light, water and moisture," Hachadourian said.

Texto completo: One School Board candidate called the Madison School District "the worst school district for black and brown children in the state of Wisconsin." Another said it had "the worst achievement gap in the country."
All six of the candidates running for the three School Board seats in the April 2 election have made boosting the academic performance of students of color a priority in their pitch to voters, even if, in some cases, they misstated the details of Madison's gap.
Achievement gaps between white students and students of color have long been a hallmark of America's public schools, and it's not easy to find a district that has been able to address the problem consistently.
"There are black-white achievement gaps in virtually every school district in the country, but Madison's gaps have been, historically, among the largest in the country," said UW-Madison professor Geoffrey Borman, whose research includes testing ways to close them. "I can't point you to a particular district that has closed gaps."
But Madison doesn't have the worst public schools in the state for children of color, as Seat 5 candidate Ananda Mirilli contended at a Feb. 19 post-primary campaign event.
Since Wisconsin rolled out the Forward exam in the 2015-16 school year, Madison's black and Latino students have never been at the bottom of black and Latino performance among the state's five largest districts Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Racine and Kenosha.
That's true in all three school years for which test results are available and for all four subject categories students are tested in: English/language arts and math in grades 3 through 8, science in grades 4 and 8, and social studies in grades 4, 8 and 10.
Compared to the statewide average for all districts, however, Madison black and Latino test performance lags that of their peers.
Madison's white students, meanwhile, outperformed white students from every other of the largest five districts in every subject and in every year the Forward exam has been in place, except on the English/language arts test in the 2015-16 school year, when it was second to Kenosha. Madison whites have also performed better on the Forward test in every year and in every subject than whites statewide.
It's this better-than-average performance by Mad-ison's white students overall that exacerbates Madison's achievement gap and makes it one of the biggest in the nation, according to a 2016 report by Stanford University and The New York Times. Though pronounced, the gap is not the worst in the country, as Seat 4 candidate Ali Muldrow said in an interview last year with Madison365.
According to the Times/ Stanford analysis, Madison's white students were 1.9 grade levels ahead of the average, while its black students and Latino students, respectively, were 2.4 and 1.7 grades behind. As the Times noted, the gaps were similar to those in some of the wealthiest communities in the country, including Evanston, Illinois, and Berkeley, California.
?Stereotype threat'
In an email, Mirilli contended that "the impact(s) of (the) racial gap on students of color are correlated to the extent of that gap. The greater the gap, the more likely students of color are to internalize stereotype threat."
Stereotype threat refers to the stress people feel when confronted with negative stereotypes about their ethnic or gender group such as that black students don't excel in school, or girls are bad at math and that such stress leads to fulfilling the stereotype, even in cases in which the group is otherwise capable of performing well.
"The greater the distance that black students lag behind white students, the greater the likelihood that black students will become discouraged and alienated," said Mirilli, who said she thought stereotype threat could be part of the reason for the gap. "The greater the gap, the greater the problem, and if not addressed it will perpetuate itself."
The district is focused on fulfilling the goals of its "strategic framework," including its local testing regimen, the Measures of Academic Progress, or MAP test, more than the state test, according to district spokeswoman Rachel Strauch-Nelson, but also points to the risk that standardized testing can "reinforce negative stereotypes."
"Standardized tests alone don't demonstrate a full picture of what students know and are able to do and may reinforce negative stereotypes," she said. "It is incumbent upon all of us to find more comprehensive and accurate ways of measuring student progress."
Muldrow said throwing up one's hands at the ubiquity and endurance of achievement gaps nationally is a "doomed approach" and a "way of telling ourselves that we're not responsible." She points to places overseas such as Cuba that have diverse populations but she said have seen more equitable student achievement across populations.
Both she and her opponent for Seat 4, David Blaska, the lone conservative running for the board, pointed to the need for more teachers of color in the schools to help close the achievement gap.
?Low expectations'
But while Muldrow also emphasizes the need for a more culturally relevant curriculum focused on the needs of individual students, Blaska's campaign is built around calling for more discipline in the schools, respect for teachers and the need for individual responsibility.
"It's fairly easy to teach professors' kids," he said. "Much more difficult to teach children who have never been read to. Part of it is low expectations by teachers, to some degree; by parents and the community to a much greater degree."
Mirilli says the district needs to adopt a variety of strategies to close an achievement gap caused by "the deep and historical institutional oppression experienced by students of color." Both she and her opponent for Seat 5, incumbent TJ Mertz, also emphasize that there is not just one gap, but many among different groups of students from different backgrounds.
"Respecting the professional judgment of our front-line educators, listening to them in district and school-wide decisions, and giving them more autonomy in their classrooms will help with gaps," Mertz told the Madison teachers union in a candidate questionnaire earlier this year.
?Institutional racism'
In the race for Seat 3, both Kaleem Caire and Cris Carusi see the gap as, in Carusi's words, "rooted in institutional racism."
Caire, who runs an independent Madison charter school, offers few specific proposals for closing the gap but told the teachers union there is "no way to address these concerns if we don't break from the status quo that got us to this place where racial segregation and distrust among people in our country is increasing again."
Carusi criticizes what she sees as the federal government's "narrow focus on standardized test results as a measure of achievement."
"As a school board member, I would continue efforts to address implicit bias in our schools and district, encourage critical examination of how institutional racism and school reform perpetuate gaps, and advocate for a more balanced approach to evaluation and accountability," she told the union.
Interventions touted
Borman pointed to research he conducted in the Madison School District from 2011 through 2017 that showed reductions in the achievement gap and improvements in graduation rates associated with "self-affirmation" interventions essentially, brief writing exercises conducted before high-stakes tests in which students of color described things that were important to them, such as family or friends, sports or art.
The theory behind the work is that such interventions can head off stereotype threat.
Strauch-Nelson said the intervention is not currently being used, "but we've been exploring use of strategies to combat stereotype threat (as well as strategies to deepen teachers' empathic mindsets) and have recently looked at Borman's work again to inform our thinking."
ACHIEVEMENT GAP BY DISTRICT
Students who identify as black or Hispanic tend to perform more poorly as a group on the Wisconsin Forward Exam than students who identify as white. Below are the gaps in reading and math scores between black and Hispanic students and white students in the state's five largest school districts for the 2017-18 school year.

Airline chief questions Max training requirements

Texto completo: The Associated Press
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - The warning and training requirements set for the now-grounded 737 Max 8 aircraft may not have been adequate, in light of the Ethiopian plane crash that killed 157 people, the chief of Ethiopian Airlines said Saturday.
After the Lion Air crash off Indonesia in October, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing "came up with contents that we incorporated in our working manuals and also briefed all our pilots. But today we believe that might not have been enough," Tewolde Gebremariam told The Associated Press in an interview in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.
Ethiopian Airlines insists the carrier's pilots went through all the extra training required by Boeing and the FAA to fly the 737 Max 8 jet. The March 10 crash killed people from 35 countries.
Gebremariam said earlier in the week that the training was meant to help crews shift from an older model of the 737 to the Max 8, which entered airline service in 2017. In a statement, he said pilots were also made aware of an emergency directive issued by the FAA after the Lion Air crash, which killed 189 people.
Ethiopian Airlines has said there is a "clear similarity" between the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, citing preliminary information from the flight data recorder.
Although the causes of the crashes haven't been determined, investigators in the Lion Air disaster have focused on an automated system designed to use information from two sensors to help prevent a dangerous aerodynamic stall.
It is not known whether the same flight-control system played a role in the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, but regulators say both planes had similar erratic flight paths, an important part of their decision to ground the roughly 370 Max planes around the world.
Both planes flew with erratic altitude changes that could indicate the pilots struggled to control the aircraft. Shortly after their takeoffs, both crews tried to return to the airports but crashed.
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the pilots of the doomed Ethiopian plane never trained in a simulator for the Max.
Gebremariam, the Ethiopian Airlines CEO, said Saturday that "it wouldn't have made any difference" as the 737 Max simulator isn't designed to imitate problems in the new jet's flight-control software. He still didn't say whether the pilots had trained on the simulator.
Boeing's planned software update for the Max must "address the problem 100 percent before we return the aircraft to air," he said, noting that the airline hasn't made a decision on whether or not to cancel orders for Max jets.
Ethiopian Airlines is widely seen as Africa's best-managed airline.
The carrier had been using five of the Max planes and was awaiting delivery of 25 more.

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
In the opening of Lorna Landvik's new novel, "Chronicles of a Radical Hag (With Recipes)," longtime Granite Creek Gazette columnist Haze Evans has suffered a stroke. As she lies in a coma, the newspaper staff wonders how to fill the void. Haze has chronicled political and personal events in the town for 50 years. Because her column is such a fixture, the newspaper's publisher, Susan McGrath, decides to rerun some of the old columns, choosing her own son, Sam, to do the curating.
Sam is a sullen teenager reeling from his parents' recent breakup. He is not happy about rifling through the un-digitized files of some old lady. He's not happy about anything. But as he reads Haze's work (marveling at handwritten responses sent through the mail!) a change comes over him. Reading about births and deaths and marriages, trips to the Boundary Waters, Thanksgiving visitors, Edith Bunker's death, former neighbors now in nursing homes, all against the backdrop of the JFK assassination, Vietnam, Title IX, Three Mile Island, Reagan, the AIDS crisis, the Challenger explosion, Hillary Clinton -- he begins to change.
Gradually, this chronic eye-roller becomes curious and empathetic. He googles things. He watches old movies. He talks to his mother. He even introduces Haze's columns to his friends who, reading them in their journalism class, find her reporting "retro-chic."
And Sam is not the only one who changes as the result of this retrospective. His mother, stressed from a recent divorce, begins to see her ex-husband in a gentler light; an ornery receptionist grows a heart; a widowed nurse dares to date again; a Fox News-infused curmudgeon brews coffee for a liberal; high school students learn to reflect on their lives.
The novel is a love letter to journalism, particularly the columnists who report on ordinary lives with simplicity and grace. If journalism is "the first rough draft of history," then columnists are our Shakespearean fools taking the king down a notch while lifting up the everyday.
When New York Times columnist Russell Baker died Jan. 21, I found myself rereading some of his columns. I read about fruitcake, women's shoulder pads, dishwashing, Richard Nixon, and the new math. In his foreword to "The Last Word," a 1997 collection of Times obituaries, Baker writes, "I am amused to realize that half the present population of the United States will not recognize (most of) the names that made up the environment in which my life was lived. From their viewpoint I am a creature from another planet."
Landvik's heartwarming novel is packed with big-hearted people tenderly and hilariously learning to appreciate the past and each other by visiting the planet of the town's octogenarian columnist and coming away the richer for it.
Christine Brunkhorst is a Minneapolis writer and reviewer.

Lower the voting age to 16?

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at her weekly news conference on Thursday, March 14th that she favors lowering the voting age to 16.
Teens should have a voice on federal elections By David de la Fuente
In the 1960s, the country asked itself that if young men can die in Vietnam, then shouldn't they be trusted with the right to vote? Similarly now, we must ask ourselves that if 16- and 17-year-olds can contribute to society through work, and face the criminal justice system as adults, isn't it only reasonable to allow them the right of self-determination through voting?
In these teen years, many individuals begin to work and pay taxes. This is also when we grant the right to drive a car. On the flip side, about 250,000 youth are tried, sentenced or incarcerated as adults every year across the USA. When they're contributing to society or being held liable by society in these ways, they should also be able to weigh in on the future of our country and those responsible for the laws that affect them.
That's why it was great to see freshman Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., lead an effort that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to preregister to vote ahead of their 18th birthday. This policy has already worked in many states: 14 states (and Washington, D.C.) already allow teenagers to preregister to vote at 16, and nine allow it for 17-year-olds.
In California alone, since 2016, more than 200,000 teenagers preregistered before their 18th birthdays.
Congress only has the authority to lower the voting age for federal elections. That's what sparked the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age in every election to 18.
Freshmen Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., proposed lowering the voting age from 18 to 16 for federal elections. The proposal failed with only 126 votes but represented a turning point in the fight for enfranchisement. It had the support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has championed such efforts at the local level in California for years.
Because voter turnout is habitual, it seems like a no-brainer to let people start voting at a younger age. If 16- and 17-year-olds can go to the polls with their parents or other adult figures, it could begin a lifetime of such civic engagement.
Lowering the voting age is a worthy endeavor. Let's do it.
David de la Fuente is a political analyst at Third Way, a center-left think tank. You can follow him on Twitter: @dpdelafuente
What others are saying Jeff Jacoby, The Boston Globe: "Teens more often rely on the amygdala, the more emotional, primitive part of the brain. It isn't from gratuitous animus that car-rental agencies make it difficult for young drivers to rent a vehicle. Or that the Constitution establishes 25 as the minimum age to be a member of Congress. Of course, another reason that 16-year-olds are subject to so many restrictions that don't apply to grown-ups is that they don't know anything — or in any case, they don't know enough to be trusted to make sound decisions about liquor, firearms, joining the Marines and governing the United States. The ignorance of teens is practically a cliché."
Laurence Steinberg,The New York Times: "Cold cognitive abilities are those we use when we are in a calm situation, when we are by ourselves and have time to deliberate and when the most important skill is the ability to reason logically with facts. Voting is a good example of this sort of situation. Studies of cold cognition have shown that the skills necessary to make informed decisions are firmly in place by 16. By that age, adolescents can gather and process information, weigh pros and cons, reason logically with facts and take time before making a decision. Teenagers may sometimes make bad choices, but statistically speaking, they do not make them any more often than adults do."
Noah Berlatsky,CNN.com: "In (America) people start voting at 18. That's the year that they often move off to college. They either have to cast ballots in a community with which they're unfamiliar, or pay attention to elections in a place where they no longer reside. That's a recipe for indifference. It would be much easier to encourage people to vote for the first time, and to establish voting patterns for a lifetime, when they're 16 and in high school. ... One objection is that young people will just vote like their parents. But researchers have found that people are always influenced by those close to them. People of all ages vote like their parents, or like their spouses, or like their neighbors."
What readers are saying Since 2016, (some) Democrats have endorsed ending the Electoral College, lowering the voting age to 16 and giving undocumented immigrants the ability to vote. Why? Because they know they can't beat President Donald Trump in 2020 under the current rules.
— @TimRunsHisMouth
Disagree that Democrats are (trying to lower the voting age) to address the 2020 election alone. It's a reaction to GOP gerrymandering. I am for two things: 1. Automatic registration and 2. Voting on Election Day.
— @gmadison1787
Most 16-year-olds don't even have a solid view of what they want to do with their future. Why would you lower the voting age for them to choose someone to run the entire country, when they don't even know what to have for breakfast?
— @joceyk13
This is what concerns me about lowering the voting age to 16. In our culture, as teenagers we do not have the needed life skills to make informed decisions that not only affect ourselves but millions of others.

Texto completo: For journalists of all ages and disciplines, there was a palpable excitement for this week's appearance of former Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein at the Boe Forum of Public Affairs at Augustana University.
The inextricably linked Woodward and Bernstein have existed as investigative icons since breaking the Watergate story that led to the downfall of Richard Nixon's presidency in the early 1970s – an ink-stained saga told with dramatic flourish in the movie "All the President's Men."
Surely these heroic figures would inspire college journalists in attendance – not to mention veteran scribes – to rise above industry challenges, resist "fake news" propaganda and protect First Amendment fervor by finding a Watergate within their own professional world.
Alas, not everything follows a Hollywood script.
The program started auspiciously enough, with Bernstein discussing how he and Woodward were uniquely suited to tackle the 1972 break-in of Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington D.C.
"We were metropolitan reporters," he told a packed house at the Elmen Center, which has hosted the likes of George H.W. Bush, Michael Gorbachev, Sandra Day O'Connor and Al Gore as part of this forum. "We were accustomed to covering things like break-ins and burglaries. But we soon found out that it was not just a local burglary. It was a vast campaign of political espionage and sabotage engineered by the President of the United States and those who worked directly under him."
The rest is history, as they say. And that history is instructive. Nixon worked to scramble the narrative by attacking the messenger, publicly castigating the Washington Post's reporting as reckless and slanted, until evidence of wrongdoing started to overwhelm the White House.
So it was unavoidable, and also a sign of the times, that the Boe Forum discussion hinged largely on President Trump, whose media misadventures and governing style were alluded to and directly confronted more than the long-disgraced Nixon.
Bernstein especially relished that subject matter, expressing the imminent doom of our republic if the current president wasn't stripped of power, as if the 2020 election didn't offer a perfectly reasonable opportunity to accomplish just that.
In a state where Trump routed Hillary Clinton by 30 percentage points and no Democratic statewide office-holders exist, it was interesting to hear applause break out when Bernstein declared the 45th president to be "an inveterate, serial liar."
After the clapping died down, Woodward observed, "There was lots of applause, but it wasn't universal." He also felt compelled, as a reporter, to point out that Bernstein's remarks were not politically partisan, after which Bernstein, now a CNN contributor, declared, "It's reportorial!"
It was a moment of needed nuance from Woodward, who serves as associate editor for the Washington Post and can best be described as Paul Simon to Bernstein's Art Garfunkel when assessing the journalists' careers after Watergate, which earned them the Pulitzer Prize.
In addition to post-9/11 reporting that helped claim another Pulitzer, Woodward has chronicled nine U.S. presidencies and written 19 books, all national bestsellers. His latest work, "Fear: Trump in the White House," sold more than 1.1 million copies in first week last September.
One man is still a reporter. The other is a pundit. It could be argued that Woodward's books – with their emphasis on anonymous sources and reconstructed dialogue – struggle to find the balance that existed back in the metro reporting days.
But he is more careful than Bernstein to avoid the trap of chasing Trump-related outrage without exploring its context beyond the Beltway, framing it as a broader American exposition.
"The novelist Graham Greene said, 'Do not despise your enemies or those who disagree with you – they have a case,'" related Woodward. "It's the journalists' job to understand that case. With Trump, there are all sorts of problems with governing crises and not dealing in facts, but he got elected president, and we must work within that context. You hear so many TV analysts say things like, 'I can't believe this poll (supporting Trump). How can people be so stupid?' Well, that's not the journalist's job. The journalist's job is to explain what went on."
Bernstein's punditry extended to the current state of media, for which he doesn't see much hope beyond the Washington Post and New York Times. Rather than urging college journalists in attendance to adopt new tools to compete in a rapidly changing field, he sounded the death knell for the newspapers and TV stations of middle America.
"The situation in regard to local news organizations in this country is disastrous," he said. "We lost hundreds and hundreds of local newspapers, particularly in cities with a quarter of million residents or less. They no longer exist."
Making the leap from an undeniable decline of print newspaper viability to the utter extinction of local reporting is irresponsible. It ignores the continuing role of media to inform and inspire during community ordeals such as river flooding or a downtown building collapse, not to mention watchdog efforts leading to the unsealing of secret city settlements or a lawsuit over freedom of information that will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Bernstein went on to say that "if it's true most young people get most of their news from (social media), it's an even bigger horror that I perceived." While that's a good millennial-bashing applause line, it fails to account for perfectly legitimate news content posted on Twitter or Facebook for mobile access – a troubling trend for print sales but not a sign of civil decay.
Perhaps most egregious (and bizarre) was Bernstein's indictment of local TV stations, which he claimed have not been reflective of their communities "for the last 40 or 50 years." Even to the ears of someone not typically known for carrying the banner for television news, that statement was downright Trumpian in its unartfulness and inaccuracy.
Woodward and Bernstein were urged several times by Augustana President Stephanie Herseth Sandlin to provide tips for aspiring journalists, but their "shoe leather reporting" days are behind them. Generalities such as "knock on people's doors" and "be methodical" fell flat in an otherwise engaging 90-minute presentation.
The best moments, not surprisingly, came when the journalism legends talked about their greatest conquest – months of painstaking and incremental reporting on the Watergate scandal and cover-up that ultimately brought down a presidency.
Though there was no mention of "Deep Throat" – Woodward's most essential anonymous source, later revealed to be former FBI associate director Mark Felt – there was a compelling anecdote about Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater inviting the reporters to his Washington apartment and reading from his personal diary of the last days of Nixon.
Goldwater had gone to the White House with other Republican congressional leaders on Aug. 7, 1974, to meet with Nixon, who was facing impeachment and weighing his odds. Nixon knew he would be charged in the House of Representatives, but he asked his fellow Republicans about his prospects in the Senate, where he needed 34 votes to stay in office.
"Goldwater told him, 'Mr. President, I counted, and you have four Republican votes – and not one of them is mine,'" recalled Woodward. "And the next day Nixon announced he was resigning."
The gravity of those words hung in the air for a while before applause broke out, casting fresh light on the low ebb of the Watergate era and how our democratic system healed itself over time. It was impossible not to draw comparisons to current concerns about the state of the presidency, which has stirred talk about changing the system to fix our nation's ills.
Woodward seemed to grasp this connection and how it pertains to the role of a free and vibrant press in shaping American history, just like all those years ago.
"There is something about this democracy at the end that works quite well," he told the audience. "This is a problem time and we've had problem times, but what do I worry about when I get up in the morning? What are the bastards hiding? Within both parties, people in power are hiding things, and secret government is what we should worry about."
It was the perfect thing for a reporter to say. It might have been lost on a pundit.

WORK LIFE; For women at Goldman Sachs: Dress down or up? Looser rules on attire pose risks for workers fighting for parity.

Texto completo: Goldman Sachs, one of the last bastions of crisp-collared, bespoke-suited workplace attire, has loosened up. It announced an official "firm-wide flexible dress code" earlier this month. And at last -- after the long, slow undoing of corporate formality -- business casual seems to have triumphed in the American workplace.
But for women and minorities who have been playing corporate catch-up for decades, a more casual dress code presents its own complications.
As one Goldman Sachs banker in GQ put it: "All the men are psyched."

For everyone else, dressing more casually for work can be fraught, even risky. Over decades, expensive suits have projected power on Wall Street, almost like a piece of "armor," said Susan Scafidi, academic director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University.
Women at work who feel pressure to prove they deserve to be in the room might be wary of ditching their blazers and pumps.
"We've just achieved the parity of the pantsuit, and suddenly we're told the standard pantsuit is no longer standard workforce attire," Scafidi said. "Women will need to find another way to achieve parity in attire at business-casual or some other lower level of formality."
Parity, of course, extends not only to power but also to pay. Jaclyn Wong, who researches the intersection of gender and professional life, co-published a study in 2016 looking at the differences in how men and women are rewarded for attractiveness in the workplace.
Attractive men and women make roughly 20% more than their less attractive co-workers, Wong found.
Even so, they are measured by different standards.
For women, perceived attractiveness was based on grooming, such as hairstyle, makeup, fitness and clothing. They are rewarded, Wong said, for looking the part. For men, grooming counts far less. If attractive, they tend to be rewarded whether they are well-groomed or not.
"We know that appearance matters for women and people of color in being seen as competent and worthy of respect," said Wong, a professor of sociology at the University of South Carolina. "It becomes this difficult position: 'Do I want to dress down because I don't want to be seen as this kind of stiff and un-fun person, or do I want to continue dressing up because that's the only way people will treat me with respect?' "
Goldman Sachs is following other firms in a hunt for tech talent that is most comfortable with the sneakers and hoodies of Silicon Valley. Also it is accommodating a growing fraction of its workforce that is made up of millennials -- with about 75% of its workers younger than 40 -- and dressing in a way that fits more casually dressed clients.
The investment bank, which announced the change in a memo, called for employees to "please dress in a manner that is consistent with your clients' expectations," but stressed that they should "exercise good judgment." A spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the memo.
"Good judgment," of course, is open to interpretation.
"You have to decide: How do you present yourself when you're often the only woman in the room?" said Jane Newton, a managing partner at RegentAtlantic. Newton spent 17 years at JPMorgan and runs a forum for women in leadership on Wall Street. "In a male-dominated environment, gravitas becomes a key variable in decisions that are made about your potential."
Workers tend to take their signals from the top. According to the lore of corporate America, IBM made its first big leap decades ago when executives such as Louis V. Gerstner Jr. changed up the uniform of suit and tie and white collar -- by mixing in blue button-down shirts.
A 1995 headline in the New York Times read: "Black Jeans Invade Big Blue" after Gerstner said he was rolling out casual dress. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard's relaxed "Blue Sky Days" on Fridays were said to influence future generations of tech entrepreneurs.
Today, it's Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon, who performs as a DJ in his spare time and has appeared in interviews without a tie.
In the 1980s and '90s, there were few role models for women on Wall Street, Newton said, so they tried to blend in. Men in suits cut imposing figures, so women wore blazers with padded shoulders. Men wore ties, so women wore blouses with bows.
Fashion is far more flexible now, she said, but younger women still ask Newton how to present themselves to be taken seriously. Sometimes she offers to go shopping with them, or she pages through catalogs to show what works and what doesn't.
"When a woman is dressed informally, she's more likely to be assumed to be more junior" or to be someone's assistant, said Laura Sherbin, managing director of Culture@Work. The topic of dress codes still comes up all the time in focus groups she does at companies, she said.
Maureen Sherry worked 12 years on Wall Street and was the youngest managing director at Bear Stearns.
"A friend of mine wore the first pantsuit on the Salomon Bros. trading floor in 1991, and it caused an uproar," she said. "She still has it" as a kind of trophy.
Today, she said, "if you saw a woman wearing Birkenstocks or loafers, we'd like to think that we're not taking her less seriously as a result, but I'm not sure if that's true."

MEDIA; AUDIOSPHERE | REVIEW; Far more than a typical whodunit; The true-crime podcast 'Conviction' surpasses the form's cliches -- but what about that final episode?

Texto completo: Less than a minute into the first episode of "Conviction," the latest release from the Gimlet Media podcast network, the narration takes on a hardboiled tone.
"Manny Gomez, private eye, lives alone in a small apartment in a quiet part of the Bronx," says Saki Knafo, the show's host and writer. "He's got this watch that's really a camera, and he has a pen that's really a knife. He says his favorite book is the Bible, but the one he talks about most often is 'The Art of War.' "
Those sentences carry echoes of classic pulp detective fiction, whose tough-talking gumshoes were also the stars of old-time radio serials, the "podcasts" of an earlier age.

It's a nervy move to begin a nonfiction tale of crime, cops and municipal corruption with a big sidelong wink at Raymond Chandler. But Knafo knows what he's doing. That Chandler-esque introduction, like nearly all the writing in the seven-part series, is fine and sharp and gives off a gleam; it's Knafo's pen that's the knife. He is invoking the hardboiled tradition ironically, setting us up for a real-life detective story that leaches out all traces of glamour -- a darker shade of noir than any Philip Marlowe mystery.
Knafo is also laying thematic groundwork. Figuratively speaking, "Conviction" is all about watches that are really cameras and pens that are really knives: about the distance between what things appear to be and what they really are, about the moral fog that clouds distinctions between justice and vengeance, good guys and bad guys, truth and lies.
These conflicts are embodied by the series' central figure, Gomez, a garrulous former cop, now private investigator, who calls himself "a punisher of the wicked ... a bringer of justice for the good."
Gomez specializes in the cases of poor young men, usually black and Latino, who are subject to aggressive police practices and the Kafka-esque indignities of New York's "Blindfold Law," which permits prosecutors to withhold nearly all the evidence against defendants until the day their trial begins. "Conviction" focuses on the case of Pedro Hernandez, a Bronx teenager who was arrested in 2016 in a shooting during a street corner melee. Hernandez maintains his innocence -- he insists he wasn't anywhere near the site of the shooting -- but bail is set at $250,000, and he spends more than a year in jail awaiting trial.
Into the breach swaggers Gomez, who is hired by the Hernandez family to root out the truth. "Conviction" chronicles the months the detective spends stalking the Morrisania neighborhood in the South Bronx, on a hunt for exculpatory evidence. He brings his crusade to the press, railing against police brutality and what he calls a "hornet's nest of corruption" in the Bronx district attorney's office.
Gomez is fascinating: charismatic, bombastic, indefatigable, with a gift of the gab that could power a dozen podcasts. (Gomez appears in Hulu's "Crime + Punishment," an award-winning Sundance documentary.) He wears double-breasted suits, professes love for Picasso and arrives at housing projects with the top dropped on his silver Corvette convertible, blasting Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" because, he says, it's important to make an impression.
We follow Gomez on sleuthing missions to upstate prisons and accompany him on hours-long stakeouts in apartment building hallways, where he comes armed with an empty 2-liter Coke bottle in case he needs to relieve himself. ("One thing about my job: You gotta have a strong bladder.") We learn about his past as an Army intelligence officer and his tenure in the NYPD, which ended badly and in part explains the fervor he brings to his battle with the cops. Gomez is both appealing and unnerving; as "Conviction" progresses, its portrayal of the private eye becomes more complicated, and the righteousness of his actions seem less certain.
I found my thoughts drifting back to the podcast's opening moments. Is Gomez's crusade based in the lofty ethical absolutes of his supposed favorite book, the Bible? Or do his machinations reflect the slipperier realpolitik of Sun Tzu's "The Art of the War," with its famous dictum, "All warfare is based on deception"?
Those questions, and the unfolding mystery of the Hernandez case, keep a listener hooked. But "Conviction" is not a straightforward procedural. It belongs to a podcast subgenre that includes the third season of "Serial" and USA Today's "The City," shows that focus on structural ills and racial inequities in urban America and the criminal justice system. Meticulously, soberly, "Conviction" exposes the toll of stop-and-frisk policing, the absurdities of the plea-bargain system, the brutal conditions faced by prisoners on New York's Rikers Island. The result is a melancholy piece of public service journalism that is far more disturbing than the grisly true crime serials clustered at the top of the podcast charts.
But the strength of "Conviction" lies less in muckraking than in portraiture. The show leans heavily on the testimonials of its characters, from Gomez to Hernandez's mother, Jessica Perez, to various bit players -- Bronx teens hanging outside street corner bodegas, rumpled defense attorneys. These people inhabit a New York that rarely appears in the countless mass media depictions of the world's most famous city. In their voices -- meaty outer-borough accents tinged with world-weariness and humor -- you hear individuals struggling to maintain their dignity in a system rigged to strip them bare.
Much of the credit for "Conviction" goes to Knafo, an investigative reporter who has written for the New York Times and other publications. His storytelling is smart, restrained and, in a gruff way, formal; the phony familiarity and twee interjections that mar so much podcast narration are nowhere to be heard in "Conviction." The show is crisply produced by Meg Driscoll, Chris Neary and Saidu Tejan-Thomas. The music, by Haley Shaw, is moody and subdued, a good fit for a tale that shuns sensationalism and finds humanity and complexity in unexpected places.
"Conviction" so assiduously avoids cliches that it comes as a shock when, in the final episode, it suddenly turns formulaic, tying its loose ends in a too-tidy bow. Knafo asks: "Which is [Manny Gomez]? A hero? Or a villain? I finally figured out the answer."
But that answer will surprise no one, and what's more, I don't believe that Knafo "finally figured out" anything. Knafo himself is too shrewd a detective, too wise about human nobility and human failings, to spend his time pondering the banal question of heroism versus villainy. This framing is simply a concession to convention: the genre rule dictating that a narrative podcast must be a first-person quest-saga, which resolves with a whodunit solution and Big Thematic Takeaways spelled out in flashing lights.
This year, Knafo published an article in the New York Times Magazine about Gomez and the Hernandez case, and that piece offered no such simple-minded denouement.
In 2019, the podcast is a mature medium; audiences can abide the same subtlety in their earbuds that they encounter on the printed page. Besides, in "Conviction," the words of the main characters strike such ringing cadences, resound with such authority, that there is no need for outside editorializing.
"I feel like I was targeted for ... growing up with the wrong people," says Hernandez. "I didn't deserve anything that happened to me."

Texto completo: It was once a prominent and bipartisan cause: the liberation of Afghan women from the tyranny of the Taliban.
These women were championed by an array of strange bedfellows: feminists like Eleanor Smeal, celebrities like Lily Tomlin and stalwarts of a conservative administration like Laura Bush and Dick Cheney.
In the early days of the invasion, the world heard vivid stories of the changes the war had brought. Women could walk freely outside their houses and put on makeup; girls could go to school. It was a narrative that helped buoy public support for the fight in Afghanistan and deflect criticism about American empire.
In November 2001, as American troops were fighting to drive Al Qaeda out of the country and topple the Taliban government, Mrs. Bush was given the megaphone of the president's weekly radio address. "Only the terrorists and the Taliban forbid education to women," she said. "Only the terrorists and the Taliban threaten to pull out women's fingernails for wearing nail polish."
Nearly two decades later, Afghan women are all but invisible to an American public thoroughly weary of the war. The future of Afghan women was not on the American agenda for its peace talks with the Taliban -- they have been limited to core security issues of terrorism and American military presence. And there is agreement among many Democratic presidential candidates about leaving Afghanistan. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar joined male presidential hopefuls in voting against a Senate rebuke of President Trump's plans for swift withdrawal from Afghanistan and Syria.
In 2004, Nasrine Gross, an Afghan women's rights activist, was among those fighting to include a clause on women's equality in Afghanistan's Constitution. Today she wonders whether all the support she thought Afghan women had from America was just a fig leaf, a way to make military intervention more palatable to the American public via photographs of girls going to school.
"How angry I am, how anguished I am," Ms. Gross said last month. She predicted an expansion of Taliban control and a return to past atrocities like stonings and whippings. "Where are these American women?"
It may seem that American priorities have changed and that past concerns for all the girls who couldn't go to school simply dissipated as the war dragged on. But it's also worth noting that years of well-publicized Taliban repression of women in Afghanistan did not prompt the American invasion; Sept. 11 did.
Afghan women were never at the heart of American strategic interests, said Barnett Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at New York University who worked on Afghan issues in the Obama administration. Military goals came first.
"You do things for people in order to get a permissive environment to help your military operation," he said.
Still, many in the administration did support the idea of expanding rights for women, and the United States, along with European governments and nongovernmental organizations, allocated substantial aid toward that end.
The aid has made a real difference. In the 17 years since the invasion, education for girls has spread; today they make up about 40 percent of the country's elementary school students and about 35 percent of its middle and high school students, according to the Feminist Majority Foundation, a Virginia-based organization led by Ms. Smeal that has been an advocate for Afghan women for more than two decades. Women now make up nearly a third of civil servants, according to the foundation, and have been encouraged to become police officers and judges. And a network of women's shelters has been established across the country.
Yet very conservative attitudes prevail in many areas outside Kabul, the capital, and women who enter men's worlds like law enforcement have often been attacked or threatened.
In the current peace talks, the United States wants a Taliban promise not to shelter terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in exchange for a military withdrawal. It is leaving other issues like women's rights to separate talks, not yet even agreed to, between the Taliban and the Afghan government, which pledges to preserve women's progress.
Signals from the Taliban have been discouraging. In interviews, diplomats speak about a group that seems emboldened. Mariam Safi, director of the Organization for Policy Research and Development Studies in Kabul, said she was told that during talks in Moscow with Afghans who are not part of the government, the Taliban said women could go to school and hold political office but not become judges or president. They regard the Constitution, with its commitment to women's equality, as illegitimate and imposed by America.
Afghan women are speaking up, at home and abroad. They are insisting they be at the negotiating table during future talks; more than 700 gathered recently to urge that the peace they desire not come at their expense.
"The talks are behind closed doors -- it's not transparent," said Sima Samar, chairwoman of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. "We've heard nothing about the discussion of women. The Taliban keep saying we will give women rights based in Shariah. Women here are very, very worried and I think we are all united in saying we are not going back."
Both Ms. Smeal and Mrs. Bush have continued to speak out about Afghan women over the years, but Ms. Smeal said the absence of women's rights from the talks' agenda so far has infused a new sense of urgency. "Now we're all waking up to the problem," she said.
Ms. Smeal said she was talking to members of Congress, bringing up the issue at the United Nations and trying to reignite bipartisan alarm, including signing a letter objecting to the withdrawal plans along with a scholar from the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire and the only woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was among several Democrats who wrote a letter urging that the Trump administration ensure that women's rights are protected during withdrawal negotiations.
But neither the public nor the Trump administration seems to be listening -- at least not so far.
Ms. Safi and Dr. Rubin pointed out that Afghan women have been victims of 40 years of war -- killed during Taliban attacks and American and Afghan troops' night raids or bombings.
Dr. Rubin believes a political settlement between the Afghan government and the Taliban is the only answer because the Taliban are not going away; he argues for a gradual withdrawal to ensure the Taliban live up to their commitments. "Don't think the U.S. is going to protect you from your own fellow Afghans forever," he said. "The best fight for women's rights is not to wage wars that cost hundreds of billions of dollars. It's not like war is good for women."
Afghan women do, indeed, long for peace. But the Taliban's track record leaves them wary, and they fear that the United States, like other great powers, sided with them only when convenient and is all too ready to abandon them when it is not.
"Women were pawns in the game in 2001," Ms. Safi said. "And now they are again."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
To walk into any cavernously large space, to tour a cathedral or factory or cave, is to feel overwhelmed by your own smallness in comparison to what surrounds you. This is what it feels like to enter The New York Times's printing plant in College Point, Queens, and look up to see papers whizzing by overhead on no fewer than 14 miles of conveyor belts. The scale of the plant seems comically oversized compared to the cramped bodegas and newsstands that we think of as our Sunday papers' natural habitat. Some employees get around the plant on giant tricycles, so great are the distances between stations that it would waste too much time to cover them on foot.
Christopher Payne, the industrial and architectural photographer whose last project for The Times Magazine's Future of Work issue was about nine people who love their jobs, has made more than 40 trips over the last two years to photograph the College Point plant. Mr. Payne's sense of wonder at what he found there is clear in his photo essay for this weekend's special section, "The Daily Miracle," which showcases his photos of the people, presses and metal plates that make The Times and deliver it around the city.
"When Payne asked for access to photograph the printing plant, we said yes, because he was exactly the right person to photograph this," Kathy Ryan, the director of photography for the Sunday magazine and NYT Magazine Labs, said of Mr. Payne. "He has a really impeccable eye for beauty. He can walk into a big, gritty, inky factory and see moments of the sublime. When he sees that paper coming rapidly over the roller, out of focus, it becomes an abstraction. That's the thing he does."
Mr. Payne's appreciation of print started at an early age. When Payne was 13 years old, his first job was selling The Boston Globe at an intersection near South Station. "When the lights changed, I had to get out of the way so I wouldn't be hit by the mirrors," he said.
He slung papers for two summers, and he lived near the Globe printing plant in Dorcester, too. "The building had a giant window facing the street, and when you drove by, you could see the presses running," Mr. Payne said. "At night while the rest of the city slept, the pressroom was alive and lit up. To a kid it was like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory: partly mysterious, partly reassuring."
Mr. Payne's photographs at the College Point plant capture the blur of up to 80,000 newspapers per hour running through the factory -- the daily New York Times, and other papers including USA Today and AM New York.
Caitlin Roper is the editorial director of NYT Mag Labs, which she describes as being able to play between a magazine and a newspaper. The labs' special broadsheet sections include the monthly Kids section, long-form fiction excerpts and more, and they are always experimenting with what's possible in newsprint. "This is a hilariously meta version of that," she said -- with the plant's behind-the-scenes role taking center stage.
Ms. Roper asked the writer and critic Luc Sante, whom she calls a "detective historian of New York," to pen the section's introductory essay. In an unexpected turn, before he had seen the finished product himself, Mr. Sante received an email from a worker at a subsidiary printing plant who had read the essay while separating plates for the section. He reached out to Mr. Sante to let him know how much he appreciated the article.
The manager at College Point, Mike Connors, has been with The Times for 43 years; he's the fourth generation of his family to work in the production of the paper. He checks in with the newsroom nearly every day, and will adjust the presses if changes come in: late-breaking stories, or updates on big stories like New Zealand's gun control laws or basketball scores.
"Nine times out of 10," Mr. Connors said, "people in 2019 are going to look for their Yankees score on their phone in the morning." But that doesn't mean that he sees an end in sight for the tradition of print.
When I visited the plant in 2018, workers said that when they got an alert on their phone during printing, as they did when Steve Jobs died, it immediately changed what they were doing -- all of a sudden, the freshly printed paper they were handling was yesterday's news.
Mr. Payne brought that perspective to bear on his project, too. "At the end of the day," he said, "everything is old news. It's not so much about staying up-to-date, it's about taking in the information, the weight of the information, and what's important."
On a (very) recent visit, Mr. Payne watched "The Daily Miracle" section itself being spun off the rollers. He doesn't believe print will last forever. "There were guys in the pressroom who were watching photos of themselves being printed," he said, "They have been working there for 20, 30 or more years, and this was the first time they were honored in this way."
Ms. Ryan, our director of photography, said that sharing these photographs of the paper in The Times itself with our readers felt right. "We wanted to print this because we felt readers would love it as much as we do. It makes our hearts sing," she said. "We want to share the incredible beauty of that place." The paper has inspired art, from Bethann Parker to Nancy Chunn to Alexandra Bell, and clothing lines. Now we wanted to take a view of the plant as a work of art in itself.

Texto completo: Two soldiers were killed Friday in Afghanistan in an incident the Taliban is claiming credit for.

The Department of Defense announced Saturday that Spc. Joseph P. Collette and Sgt. 1st Class Will D. Lindsay died in Kunduz Province as a result of wounds that they suffered during combat during Operation Freedom's Sentinel, the U.S. counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan.

The military says that the incident, for which the Taliban has claimed credit, is still under investigation.

Both soldiers were based out of Fort Carson, Colo.

Collette, 29, was from Lancaster, Ohio, and assigned to the 242nd Ordnance Battalion, 71st Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group.

Lindsay, 33, was from of Cortez, Colo., and assigned to 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne).

Collette first joined the Army back in 2010, and served as explosive ordnance disposal specialist. His deployment to Afghanistan began in December 2018 and had already been awarded with a Purple Heart during his deployment.

Collette’s wife, Caela Marie Collette, told Stars & Stripes she and Collette were newlyweds: “We didn’t have our full ceremony yet because we didn’t have time. We got married less than a month before he deployed and then when he returned in June we were going to fly to Florida and have a ceremony there.”

She said Collette been motivated to join the military because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and wanted to deploy before he left the military in 2020. “He was getting out of the Army in February next year and had never been on deployment," she said. "He wanted to go on deployment badly.”

After he was killed on Friday, Collette’s wife called him "my best friend" in a Facebook post about his death. "I’m so lost without him right now," she wrote.

Lindsay, a Green Beret, had joined the Army in 2004, and served in the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) for 13 years.

U.S. Special Operations Command said that Lindsay had deployed to Iraq five times during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn, and to Tajikistan in 2016 as part of a counternarcotics terrorism mission in addition to his recent deployment in Afghanistan.

During his numerous deployments, he was awarded four Bronze Stars as well as a Purple Heart.

Col. Lawrence Ferguson, commander of the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), praised Lindsay’s service: “Will was one of the best in our formation."

Lindsay leaves behind a wife and four daughters.

Newsweek reported other American soldiers were wounded in the fighting, including a special forces soldier in stable condition who will be evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. Two other U.S. service members were also wounded in the firefight, and both are expected to recover.

Qayum Nuristani, a spokesman for the Afghan special forces, told the New York Times that an Afghan commando was also killed in the fighting and that three others Afghan soldiers were wounded. He also said that many Taliban were also killed in the battle.

Collette and Lindsay are the third and fourth U.S. service members killed in Afghanistan in 2019.

More than 2,400 U.S. service members have been killed and more than 20,000 wounded in Afghanistan since combat operations began there in October 2001, following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.

There are roughly 14,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan helping train the Afghan Armed Forces. The U.S. also carries out counterinsurgency and counterterrorism efforts against the Taliban, al Qaeda, ISIS, and other terrorist elements that have found a safe haven in the country.

The U.S. government, led by U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad, has been negotiating for months with Taliban representatives in Qatar.

Khalilzad claims that the U.S. and the Taliban have tentatively agreed on two aspects of an agreement: a timeline for U.S. withdrawal from the country and guarantees from the Taliban that foreign terrorists would not be welcome. Many are skeptical of the Taliban’s trustworthiness on following through on its assurances.

The Afghan government has been excluded from these discussions at the request of the Taliban to their great frustration.

Texto completo: Illustration U.S. Rep. Steve King, who Fort Dodge, Iowa, police say Lafayette resident Blake Gibbins threw water on Friday at a local restaurant. Gibbins was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct following the incident.

A Lafayettte man was arrested in Fort Dodge, Iowa, on Friday after police say he dumped a glass of water on U.S. Rep. Steve King's head inside the Mineral City Mill and Grill.
Fort Dodge police in a news release said 26-year-old Blake Gibbins was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct. Police allege that King was eating lunch in the restaurant when Gibbins approached him, confirmed his identity and threw a glass of water on him and other people at the table.
Police said that based on witness statements, King was targeted because he is a U.S. congressman. King, and another person listed as a victim, were not injured.
King was criticized heavily the day before the incident after comparing Iowans' response to historical flooding to that of victims of Hurricane Katrina. King at a recent town hall meeting said Iowans haven't relied on government handouts as Katrina victims did, a comment some said played into racist tropes about black Americans.
In January, King was removed from his House committee assignments after, in an interview with the New York Times, he questioned why white supremacist terminology was "offensive." He has denied he is a white supremacist.
On Saturday, King retweeted conservative blogger Michelle Malkin, who is angry that a gofundme page called "Free Blake" sprang up on Friday night. As of Saturday afternoon, the page had raised more than $3,600.
The Washington Post contributed to this report.

Alex Cora almost stopped himself before he completed the sentence, but true to his nature, went ahead and said what was on his mind.
“If you guys thought last year was special," the Red Sox manager teased, pausing just long enough to make his final punch especially powerful. “Wait till this year."
This was during the annual offseason Boston Baseball Writers Dinner, while Cora was accepting his Manager of the Year award. There he stood, thick in that heady interlude between past perfection and future potential, the elation over a recently won championship eclipsed only by the excitement for the possibility of doing it again. And as the Red Sox wrapped up spring training this month in Florida, there's been little to dim the bravado Cora shared at that January dinner. With a potent lineup, stellar defense, and a starting rotation to match any in the majors, only the questions around the bullpen remain, and that's not nearly enough to derail the train of optimism that this team can repeat.

“To be honest with you, this ball club looks so good, man, from head to toe," none other than Sox legend David Ortiz told reporters in Fort Myers. “It's like you walk into that clubhouse and you can feel the good vibe, you can feel that. If there's one person who can explain that, it's myself because I was in the clubhouse for a long time, and I have an even better feeling this year than the feeling I had last year.
“And I told you guys how good I felt about the ball club last year. But it's because you can see on the players' faces the experience they went through in the playoffs, what they learned, how confident you feel about how you did and the result and everything. I mean, as a player, I can tell you that plays a big role for the following season.
“Why not?"
The Sox deserve to be confident. But they also need to be wary. Baseball, with its sheer volume of teams, with its expanded playoff format and diminishing windows of star talent, is probably the most difficult of the four major sports to repeat as champions. But it's interesting to note that the last team to do it, the 1999 Yankees, bears a strikingly similar situation to what the 2019 Red Sox face.

The '99 Yankees are often forgotten in the Yankees' dynastic run of four titles in five years. The 1996 team? They were the first, the special ones for breaking a forgettable decade of the '80s, when mediocrity reigned. The 2000 team? They bested the crosstown rival Mets in a memorable Subway Series, as New York an event as sports had seen in a very long time. And the 1998 team? Well, they were the all-timers, who would win a ridiculous 114 games in the regular season and surge through the playoffs all the way to a World Series sweep.
That leaves the '99 team, one that struggled for much of the season to find its footing. As then-New York Times beat writer and now ESPN baseball insider Buster Olney wrote late in the season, “all year the Yankees have played in the shadow of what they accomplished in 1998, when they set a record by winning 125 games and finished with a four-game sweep of San Diego in the World Series. Players sometimes griped early in the year that fans and the news media unfairly compared the 1999 Yankees to that standard, but by midsummer it became apparent that the Yankees themselves were trying to live up to their own impossible expectations. Nearly all the Yankees have been guilty of pressing and pushing themselves into ruts of anxiety at one time or another."

Some rumblings had been there since spring, when a blockbuster trade on the day players reported changed the roster dynamics. The Yankees acquired former Red Sox ace Roger Clemens from Toronto in a deal that included giving away David Wells. Ultimately, the rotation of Clemens, Orlando Hernandez, Andy Pettitte, and David Cone was enough to anchor another title run. The Red Sox foursome of Chris Sale, David Price, Rick Porcello, and Nathan Eovaldi (along with Eduardo Rodriguez) certainly has a chance to be as good. But it wasn't all rosy in New York. Manager Joe Torre missed a chunk of the early season getting treatment for prostate cancer, which also affected veteran Darryl Strawberry, who'd been treated for colon cancer.
In the end, those Yankees did find their way, clinching the division in late September, their 98 regular-season wins four better than the wild-card finishing Red Sox. They'd sweep the Rangers in the division round, beat the Sox in the ALCS (Bernie Williams's walkoff homer off Rod Beck in Game 1 set the tone, and not even a memorable Fenway meltdown by Clemens could derail the train), and keep their World Series winning streak alive by sweeping the Braves. An impressive 11-1 record in the playoffs proved both how much they had shed the identity of the previous year and how much they kept the momentum of the previous year.
Can the Sox do the same? That is the challenge — believing in this year's team while forgetting last year's. Because the nature of sports demands at least some measure of Belichickian focus. It's on to 2019, boys, where last year's 108 regular-season wins, last year's MVP performance by Mookie Betts, last year's trump-card playoff pitching heroics of David Price, last year's unlikely emergence of World Series MVP Steve Pearce, they're all washed away. Time to start again.

Texto completo: Su familia no tiene hogar, tras llegar a Nueva York como refugiados desde Nigeria.
Pero eso no ha sido impedimento para que con apenas 8 años de edad el niño Tanitoluwa Adewumi ganara el primer lugar en el campeonato de ajedrez del estado de Nueva York sin una sóla derrota, en su grupo de edad.
“Me gusta el pensamiento profundo”, dijo Tanitoluwa a NBC News.
El estudiante de 3er grado comenzó a jugar ajedrez hace un año y según Shawn Martínez, su entrenador en P.S. 116 (Midtown East), practica el juego de mesa todos los días durante varias horas, por su cuenta.
Tanitoluwa se mudó a la ciudad de Nueva York con su familia hace dos años como refugiados de Nigeria. Sus padres temían ataques del grupo terrorista Boko Haram y por ello están buscando asilo religioso.
La familia ha estado viviendo en un refugio para personas sin hogar y sus padres dicen que allí el niño sólo puede practicar en el suelo. Pero eso no ha detenido la inquebrantable dedicación de Tanitoluwa para mejorar su destreza en el ajedrez.
Hace uno días Tanitoluwa ganó el torneo de Ajedrez Primario del estado de Nueva York en su grupo de edad y se llevó a casa un gran trofeo para demostrarlo. “Sus ojos se iluminaron”, dijo Martínez.
Después de la victoria de Tanitoluwa, Russell Makofsky, quien supervisa el programa de ajedrez en su escuela, lanzó una página en GoFundMe para ayudar a la familia a salir del refugio.
En unos días, el esfuerzo de financiación colectiva superó su objetivo de recaudar $50 mil dólares y un donante le ofreció un apartamento a la familia. Hasta anoche, más de $180 mil dólares habían sido donados por 3,400 personas, más del triple de la meta de recaudación de fondos en tres días. Y la familia estaba lista para tener por fin su propio hogar en Nueva York.
Mientras tanto, Tanitoluwa se está preparando para el campeonato nacional en mayo. “Quiero ser el gran maestro más joven del mundo”, afirmó.
Y hasta fue entrevistado por The New York Times.

Texto completo: Two years before the election of President Trump and the bitter politics of border walls, Muslim bans and s---hole countries, the American publishing industry was facing an identity crisis. A viral social media movement led by writers of color called #WeNeedDiverseBooks began pushing the industry to acknowledge and address its resounding whiteness. The failure to cultivate the voices of American writers of minority and immigrant backgrounds was the failure to tell a full national story, writer Junot Diaz explained in a New Yorker essay.
Soon after the 2016 election, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Viet Thanh Nguyen published a piece in The New York Times arguing that the outcome was partly the failure of writers. "The struggle over the direction of our country," he wrote, "is also a fight over whose words will win and whose images will ignite the collective imagination." Immigrants needed to tell their story - and tell it better.
"The Good Immigrant" is a culmination of the current political moment and a natural extension of the ongoing work to integrate American publishing. The 26 essays in this anthology are deeply personal reflections on adolescence, family, love and identity as experienced and felt by the American immigrant artist. From published heavyweights like Teju Cole and Alexander Chee to newer voices like Muslim American punk-rocker Basim Usmani and Pakistani Kashmiri-American poet Fatimah Asghar, this banquet of writing is a triumphant celebration of American multiplicity.
The book was inspired by an original British edition, which was published at the height of the Brexit debate with a largely different roster of writers. In the introduction to the American edition, the editors, Nikesh Shukla and Chimene Suleyman, explain that what both collections share is their desire to amplify the voices of immigrants through a kind of collective literary activism. In a cultural climate defined by xenophobia and anti-immigrant policies, this book seeks to showcase the gifts and humanity of immigrant artists.
It's a noble mission. And yet, as a reader, I worried that a collection defined by politics could crumble under the weight of good intentions. Essays lifted from social media outrage or powered by reactionary rage can satisfy in the instant but fade as the moment passes. Thankfully, this collection is a resounding success on multiple fronts. Its righteous rage is perfectly matched by its literary rewards.
The American edition of the "The Good Immigrant" is best heard as a surround-sound chorus that bristles with an unpredictable, electric energy. Language, style and rhythm shift with each piece, keeping our attention. In "Luck of the Irish," Maeve Higgins explores how white privilege helped her, an Irish immigrant living in the country illegally, as brown families in similar conditions are prosecuted. In a love letter to her mother, Indian-American writer Krutika Mallikarjuna finds humor in the ridiculous conundrum of dating in the multiracial mayhem of Brooklyn. "Of the many pitfalls of being a queer desi woman swimming through Tinder," she writes, "I never expected to find myself getting trashed in a bar trying to forget that I was on a date with a white girl named India."
Several of the essays are by first-time authors who work in other artistic mediums. My favorite essay is by Nigerian-American fashion designer Wale Oyejide. The African-inspired textiles and silhouettes of his celebrated fashion line Ikire Jones are regularly shown on global runways and featured prominently in the Oscar-winning blockbuster "Black Panther." In an essay about his artistic coming of age, Oyejide explores the struggles of stay-at-home fatherhood with biting humor and then widens his lens to a crisis of masculinity that fails to allow men to be more than conventional breadwinners and pursue the arts. He writes about his designs as a political instrument to restore dignity and beauty to black bodies draped in shades of violence and suffering in popular culture.
"Our uprisings don't always come in the guise of smashed windows, overturned cars or respectable slave owners forcibly torn from their stone housings in front of Capitol buildings. Sometimes they come in the form of building-sized brown faces broadcast on cinema screens, portraying characters who are miles away from the token mistress we have to come to accept for want of more inspiring alternatives," he writes. Immigrant creativity is about imagining new possibility, he explains: "There will be endless stories to write. And, increasingly, there will be audiences filled with us waiting to hear them being told."
The best work here offers reflections on the creative process, alongside the fear of family, society and failure that keeps many immigrant artists from expressing themselves. The collection concludes with a call to arms by novelist Jade Chang, with a practical step-by-step guide to embracing one's voice titled "How to Center Your Own Story."
As I finished "The Good Immigrant," my mind was buzzing with the multitude of voices, stories, heartbreaks and dreams featured in its 300-plus pages. The book is a welcome corrective to the nationalist calls for walls, borders and exclusion that seek to narrow the boundaries of what it means to be American. Each essay is a tantalizing introduction - and invitation - to the larger body of work these artists have already created and will continue to make long after this moment passes.
Bilal Qureshi is a culture writer and radio journalist whose work has appeared in The Washington Post, The New York Times and Newsweek, and on NPR.

For Him, Punishment Is a Lot Like Passion

Texto completo: "I can't understand these chaps who go round American universities explaining how they write poems," Philip Larkin once complained. "It's like going round explaining how you sleep with your wife."
His interlocutor replied, "They'd do that, too if their agents could fix it."
Truly, all things come to pass. The essayist David Shields has written a new book, "The Trouble With Men," which he describes as "a short, intensive immersion into the perils, limits and possibilities of human intimacy." More bluntly, it's about sleeping with his wife -- and addressed to her. "Do I love you? Do you love me? What kind of marriage do we want?" he asks her. "Do you like making love with me? Do you love making love with me? (Don't answer.)"
Despite the broad diagnosis promised by the title, the focus is narrow, personal -- and frank. Shields breaks the sound barrier for indiscretion. He quotes Harold Brodkey: "I don't see the point of privacy." (Fittingly, Brodkey's other appearance here features him trying to pick up Shields at a gym in 1983.)
The book is structured as an investigation into Shields's own psyche and particular tastes. He is masochistic to his marrow -- not just sexually. "I check the Mariners score on my phone, hoping they've won but needing them to lose." He relishes his negative reviews. His entire career owes something to his desire for punishment. "Throughout various books, I've quoted and 'misquoted' hundreds of sentences, without 'proper' attribution -- in order to advance a particular literary, aesthetic and philosophical principle but also as a way to be 'bad' and get spanked (for being bad)?"
Alas, he has been more frequently celebrated instead -- for works, like "Reality Hunger," that railed against lumbering, outmoded narratives (the novel) in favor of fleet new forms: fragments, rafts of sampled quotations, blurred genres. "The Trouble With Men" reprises this method; much of it is a collage of quotes, from his touchstones like Seneca and the literary critic Leslie Fiedler but also Reddit, porn chat rooms and Bernie Madoff's mistress.
In the past, I found Shields's project occasionally impressive and more often exasperating. He's fatally attracted to the manifesto and strident pronouncements on life and literature. But in this latest work, some of his masks and bombast fall away. He is wry and self-deprecating. (That quote from Larkin above -- I got it from Shields.) This book had originally been conceived as an email exchange with the writer Brenda Phillips, but Shields realized that "the gulf was simply too wide: She's so much better looking than I am -- and as a result has had so many more sexual experiences -- that we had next to nothing to talk about."
For the first time, this writer becomes good company -- thankfully, for we have to travel a long way with him, deep into the labyrinth of his past. "How did I get wired this way? I don't get it," Shields writes. Did he learn to eroticize what hurt and frightened him as a child? (Yes.) "As a little kid, I would start every morning by promising myself (and inevitably failing to live up to the promise), Don't cry today." His father was a manic-depressive and "ECT devotee," in and out of mental institutions; his mother mocked him, hit him, hated him and taught him to hate himself. He unwraps all his wounds, all the conceivable sources that nurtured in him this perplexing desire to be humiliated: childhood bullying, his stutter, germ phobias, acne and high, feminine voice. "Was I breast-fed?" he pesters his bewildered 80-year-old father. "Method of potty-training?"
"No one is ever cured of anything; that much seems obvious," Shields writes. "Which brings me to you." This "you" is his wife -- a woman Shields describes as painfully and thrillingly indifferent to him. "Do you think it's possible that I've enlisted you to cure my heart by killing it?" he writes, before accusing her of mild crimes: She refuses to hold his hand in public and is excessively practical. On one occasion she failed to keep an embarrassing secret of his.
"The Trouble With Men" is unabashedly queasy. Reading about Shields's lust for Pippa Middleton ranks among the more depressing literary experiences of my life. But it's curious that he doesn't reckon more with what it means to expose himself (and his wife) so openly -- is it another bid for humiliation? Nor does he reckon with the fact that there is almost always something preening and aggressive in the act of enumerating of one's own weaknesses. "I'm always the poor pup who loses," Shields whimpers -- like all the top dogs apparently: "Was there, by the way, any 'major' modernist writer -- Kafka, Woolf, Proust, Mann, Joyce, Eliot -- who wasn't flagrantly masochistic?"
I don't want to be too hard on Shields, not least because I suspect he would enjoy it. I often found this book beguiling, and moving. There is always the temptation, in writing about sex, to sound superior, arch, immune to its power. But Shields writes from a place of genuine curiosity and confusion. He is ridiculous and brave, he never conflates sincerity with genuine candor, and he poses the kinds of questions that only ever bring trouble (and are the only kind worth reading about) -- about sex, self-knowledge and the "theater" of our wounds. Can we recover from who we are? Would we want to?
"My mother reviled me," Shields writes. "I can feel that in every footfall. My half-brother's mother adored him, which has made him fat and sassy and self-satisfied and happy. Poor bastard."

Texto completo: The first time I watched "Arrested Development" reminds me of the first time I drank a cup of joe. The show's rapid-fire banter, its subtle running jokes (even in the background of some episodes), the bizarre ensemble of unlikable but compulsively watchable characters and the exceedingly clever meta in-jokes peppered throughout it all made for an entirely new television experience. Like that coffee, I found the show exciting and energizing. It was a whole new world, suddenly burst open, and I didn't think I'd be able to look at TV the same way again.
As any caffeine-drinker knows, however, having the right amount of coffee is key. Too much, after all, isn't energizing but instead leads to a dull, insistent headache.
Netflix dropped eight episodes of "Arrested Development," forming the second half of Season 5, on Friday. Many have suggested this might be the final batch of episodes - and I pray they're correct.
The once-adored show has fallen out of favor twice since Netflix revived it. The first black eye came with Season 4 in 2013, seven years after its cancellation after three seasons on Fox in 2006. Showrunner Mitchell Hurwitz and his crew attempted a radical experiment in the streaming age: to create a show whose episodes could be watched in any order. Each episode followed one specific character and worked as a sort of puzzle, with no true beginning or ending. This was partially because of the cast's scheduling conflicts, but it also felt like a very "Arrested Development" ploy - only it failed miserably, earning the dismissal of critics and fans alike.
The second came with the first batch of Season 5 episodes, which dropped last May. They felt (somewhat) like a return to form, but the rollout was tainted by sexual harassment allegations against Jeffrey Tambor from fellow cast members on his Amazon show "Transparent," Trace Lysette and Van Barnes. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Tambor was dropped from "Transparent" but remained on "Arrested Development" - which led to a disastrous roundtable interview in the New York Times in which Jessica Walter accused Tambor of being verbally abusive on set, while the show's male cast members defended him and, in essence, ignored Walter.
But putting all that aside for a moment, and looking only at the content of this second half of Season 5 - it's still a tough hang, to put it lightly.
The show is so mired in the past that its title no longer induces chuckles but groans. Humor, of course, is always subjective. But the new episodes don't really seem to traffic in jokes so much as nostalgia. Recurring characters such as the always-in-disguise private eye Gene Parmesan appear for mere seconds, not to introduce new jokes but to redo old ones, seemingly just to remind viewers that they exist.
Sometimes, the humor feels outdated, such as the introduction of a group of hard-boiled, criminal gay men who call themselves the Gay Mafia. They fit into a plotline in which Gob has to pretend to be gay (or maybe he really is). The plotline is supposed to be meta, making fun of Gob for his insecurity with his sexuality. But the jokes fail, leaving the enterprise feeling like the very gay panic humor it's attempting to mock.
At other times, the show's references feel painfully outdated. It's set just before the 2016 election, and the number of Hillary-is-sure-to-win jokes is exhausting. Even its shoehorned Donald Trump jokes, such as Gob referencing "s---hole countries," don't feel as fresh as they might have months ago. That's not even mentioning that a large plot point is set around the bumbling Bluths attempting to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border (oddly, to appease the Chinese). That's a tough sell for comedy these days. Sure, such a plotline could easily produce smart satire - but the show treats the wall like an outlandish idea perpetuated by foolish and selfish people, not a divisive political reality that has caused real-world effects such as the shutdown of the U.S. government.
But the biggest problem with the back half of Season 5 is that it's simply not funny.
Jerry Seinfeld famously turned down the most lucrative television deal at the time to continue producing "Seinfeld" because he never wanted to jump the shark. Hurwitz and crew should take a page from the legendary comedian's book.
"Arrested Development," once a wonderfully layered experience that rewarded repeated watches more than almost any other show, now just feels like work. It's the embodiment of a caffeine headache - insistent, annoying and, worst of all, dull.

Texto completo: Cameras lined the wall beneath the large screen broadcasting the NCAA men's basketball tournament selection show. They captured the Gophers cheering, then laughing, then cheering again as the screen revealed their first-round destination and opponent.
Richard Pitino seemed to cackle before composing himself. His players sneaked looks at their coach, knowing that were playing against Louisville, his former employer and the scourge of his father.
The Gophers will play Louisville on Thursday in Des Moines. This information prompted players to celebrate briefly and speak diplomatically of their No. 10 seeding and difficult opponent.
Then they walked outside and threw snowballs at each other.
This is why the tournament is a joyful exercise in orchestrated chaos. These are kids taking these big shots. They'll do their homework, maybe throw a few snowballs, then play in a tournament that makes the networks millions and turns coaches into kings.
"I am lucky,'' Pitino said. "I'm 36 years old and I'm the head coach at a great place. There's not going to be one complaint from me. You'll never hear it, because I'm really grateful to be a part of it.''
He's got that right.
For all the complaining Minnesotans do about the lack of male-team championships won by locals, this state plays host to a stunning number of desirable national and international sporting events.
With the Final Four scheduled for the first weekend in April at U.S. Bank Stadium, Minnesota continues a run of major events that also include the MLB All-Star Game, the Ryder Cup, the Super Bowl, the WNBA All-Star Game, frequent WNBA Finals and a new PGA Tour stop.
In an 11-month period from 1991-92, the Twin Cities hosted a U.S. Open, a Stanley Cup Final, a Final Four, a World Series and a Super Bowl. New York Times columnist George Vecsey called Minnesota "the sports capital of the United States.''
The Gophers' qualifying for the tournament that will end a couple of miles from campus means we get to see the bracket through the eyes of such Minnesotans as Daniel Oturu, Gabe Kalscheur and Jarvis Omersa.
Minneapolis played host to the Final Four twice before, at the Metrodome -- in 1992 and 2001. The Gophers didn't make the tournament either year.
That's not surprising. According to the NCAA, the Gophers have officially made the NCAA tournament 10 times.
"In program history, that's 10 officially, 14 unofficially,'' Pitino said. "That's not a lot. So for guys in that locker room to make it two out of three, they need to be proud of that.''
For the first time, a Gophers team will begin March Madness with the dream of playing in the Final Four in Minneapolis.
Its selection is just one of many reasons to celebrate the spectacle of the tournament.
The first reason: The NCAA's sense of humor isn't limited to its bosses saying that they can't afford to pay athletes.
Pitino vs. Louisville? Surely, that's a coincidence. The pairing has nothing to do with Louisville running Rick Pitino off, or Rick's bitterness toward the school, or Richard's history as an assistant coach there under his father.
"It's not going to be about me,'' Richard Pitino said. "I'm not going to be, 'Oh, it's revenge.' ''
With Rick coaching in Greece, if Richard beats Louisville he should expect to receive a large bottle of ouzo in a package featuring a lot of unusual-looking stamps.
Can the Gophers win?
We can't know, and that's the point of the tournament. Minnesota and Louisville didn't play this season. Louisville earned a higher seed but lost eight of its last 12 games. Four of those losses came against ACC powerhouses Duke, Virginia and North Carolina.
Add all of that together, and you know nothing other than you have to find a way to watch on Thursday, even if it means implanting screens on the inside of your eyelids so the boss can't catch you.
Because you never know what will happen in March, when the kids scatter across the country and take their best shot.

Texto completo: In Rome, the college of cardinals is gathering to mourn one pope and select his successor. An ambitious rogue cardinal arrives on the island of Malta seeking ancient documents from the secretive Knights of Malta that will pave his way to the papacy. These are just two strands of the convoluted plot of "The Malta Exchange" (Minotaur Books, 393 pp., ), the 14th novel by Steve Berry featuring Cotton Malone, a retired Justice Department operative turned seller of rare books.
Malone arrives in Lake Como, Italy, in pursuit of letters exchanged between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini that British intelligence fears will reveal some embarrassing dealmaking aimed at preventing Italy from joining forces with Germany in World War II.
Why is this so urgent in the 21st century? You got me. But Berry is a New York Times best-selling author, so to quote Pope Francis, "Who am I to judge?"
As Malone arrives at a villa to nab the letters, bullets zing by, bodies are strung up and, inexplicably, a bear rumbling through the villa attacks Malone. Soon, Malone is entwined in the case of Cardinal Gallo, the papal wannabe, and a murderous subsector of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic humanitarian group with its own agenda for the new pope. Gallo's estranged identical twin, Pollux, has been temporarily placed in charge of the Knights, seeking to thwart his brother's ambitions.
Author Berry has a passion for history and historical preservation, so look for long passages about the Catholic Church, Constantine, Mussolini and various other European conquerors. You'll find yourself wondering about several key plot points: Is any of this really true? For the most part, Berry confesses in an epilogue at the end, it isn't.

Texto completo: "Billions" returns for a fourth season on Showtime. And Aidy Bryant stars in "Shrill" on Hulu.
What's on TV
BILLIONS 9 p.m. on Showtime. If you're wondering how long it takes for a spoonful of cocaine to be snorted in the latest season of "Billions," the answer is: more than one second after the opening credits, less than 10. And it's done casually. Since it debuted in 2016, the series -- created by Brian Koppelman, David Levien and the columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times -- has dealt with the extraordinary wealth surrounding its main characters, Bobby Axelrod (a hedge fund manager played by Damian Lewis) and Chuck Rhoades (a United States attorney played by Paul Giamatti), with somewhat restrained displays of excess. "When they hit the billion and above number, they're no longer in a place where they have to impress anybody by their outward trappings," Levien recently told The Times. That might help explain why, in the Season 4 premiere episode on Sunday night, Axelrod conducts a surprise firing in his office while wearing a Motörhead T-shirt and washed denim jeans. The previous season ended with a surprise alliance between Axelrod and Rhoades, who had been longtime foes. So audiences can look forward to a new dynamic this season.
TRICKY DICK 9 p.m. on CNN. "A moving van has just pulled up over at the White House." That line -- from a TV broadcast on the eve of Richard Nixon's resignation -- is delivered during the first few minutes of this four-part documentary, which covers Nixon's political life through archival footage.
What's Streaming
SHRILL Stream on Hulu. Aidy Bryant of "Saturday Night Live" stars in this new series, based on Lindy West's memoir, "Shrill: Notes From a Loud Woman." (West is a contributing opinion writer for The Times.) Bryant plays Annie, a Portland, Ore., writer with a mediocre boyfriend and a society that tells her she should be skinnier. She's fed up, and the first season's plot revolves largely around her doing something about that. "The main reason 'Shrill' lands is Bryant's unfussy performance," Margaret Lyons wrote in her review for The Times. "She radiates the wounded hopefulness of someone who's ready for the next chapter of her life, and by the end of the six-episode season, she's there."
BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA Stream on Topic. The Feminist Bird Club, a hip birding collective, is the focus of one episode of this new documentary series, hosted by Jason Ward, a "bird nerd" from the Bronx. The show dives into different birding communities through bite-size episodes, covering subjects like the Cape May Spring Festival in New Jersey and the bird specimen collections at the American Museum of Natural History. In one episode, Ward goes birding in Brooklyn with the comedian Wyatt Cenac, who jokingly asks if birds go "people-ing," watching humans as humans watch them. This show -- which is as interesting for the personalities it introduces as it is for the birds -- gives viewers a chance to do both.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Students across a warming globe pleaded for their lives, future and planet Friday, demanding tough action on climate change.
From the South Pacific to the edge of the Arctic Circle, students in more than 100 countries walked out of classes to protest what they see as the failures by their governments.
More than 150,000 students and adults who were mobilized by word of mouth and social media protested in Europe, according to police estimates. But the initial turnout in the United States did not look quite as high.
"Borders, languages and religions do not separate us," Havana Chapman-Edwards, 8, who calls herself the tiny diplomat, told hundreds of protesters at the U.S. Capitol. "Today we are telling the truth and we do not take no for an answer."
The "school strikes" were inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, 16, who began holding solitary demonstrations outside the Swedish parliament last year.
Since then, the weekly protests have snowballed from a handful of cities to hundreds, fueled by headlines about the impact of climate change during the students' lifetime. Unless emissions of heat-trapping gases start dropping dramatically, scientists estimate that the protesters will be in their 40s and 50s, maybe even 30s, when the world will reach dangerous levels of warming that international agreements are trying to prevent.
Thunberg, who has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, said at a rally in Stockholm that the world faces an "existential crisis, the biggest crisis humanity ever has faced and still it has been ignored for decades."
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was inspired by the student climate strikers to call a special summit in September to deal with what he called "the climate emergency."
French begin work on analysis of recorders in deadly jet crash
HEJERE, Ethiopia - Analysis of the flight recorders of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines plane has begun, the airline said Friday, and The New York Times reported that the pilot requested permission "in a panicky voice" to return shortly after takeoff as the plane dipped up and down and appeared to gain startling speed.
President Donald Trump in a phone call with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed praised the state-owned airline "as a strong institution" and affirmed U.S. support after Sunday's plane crash killed 157 people, Abiy's office said.
The Times report cited "a person who reviewed air traffic communications" as saying controllers noticed the plane was moving up and down by hundreds of feet.
French authorities have said it is unclear whether data could be retrieved from the recorders.
EPA bans consumer sales of paint stripper linked to deaths
WASHINGTON - The Environmental Protection Agency is banning consumer sales of a paint stripper after personal appeals by families of men who died while using the product.
The final rule announced Friday bars the manufacture and import of consumer products containing methylene chloride.
The EPA is urging consumers not to use it.
The consumer bans begin 180 days after the rule is published. The EPA says it expects retailers to implement it sooner. The rule doesn't affect commercial uses.
California says it's tracked at least five deaths since 2014 among people overcome by the fumes from methylene chloride.
Families of victims had met with Trump administration officials and lawmakers urging the ban.
Senate to probe if DOJ officials discussed removal of Trump
WASHINGTON - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham says his panel will investigate a claim by former FBI Director Andrew McCabe that Justice Department officials once discussed using the Constitution's 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office.
McCabe has said that after former FBI Director James Comey was fired in May 2017, officials at the department, including McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, discussed bringing the Cabinet together to consider using the amendment to remove Trump. The Justice Department said in February that department leaders did not believe there was any basis for invoking the 25th Amendment.
Graham sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr.
High court expands April 23 census arguments
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court will try to resolve all the legal issues about a citizenship question on the 2020 census.
The justices Friday are expanding their April 23 arguments to include whether asking about citizenship would violate the Constitution's call for a once-a-decade count of all people, not just citizens. The court was considering whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add a citizenship question is arbitrary and capricious under federal law.
The court is hearing the Trump administration's appeal of a federal judge's ruling in New York that the decision violated federal law. A judge in California said a citizenship question also would violate the Constitution.
A final answer about a citizenship question is needed soon to allow printing of the census questionnaire.
U.S. airline cites safety in halting flights to Venezuela
FORT WORTH, Texas - American Airlines is stopping flights to Venezuela because of safety concerns after the pilots' union told its members to refuse to work the flights.
American was the last major U.S. carrier to fly to the troubled country. It flew daily to Caracas and Maracaibo from Miami.
The airline said Friday that it temporarily stopped the flights as it evaluated conditions in Venezuela, where civil unrest has increased amid opposition to President Nicolas Maduro.
The airline's decision followed a union president's order Thursday night that American Airlines pilots refuse Venezuela assignments.
United Airlines and Delta Air Lines stopped flying to Venezuela in 2017, and several foreign carriers have also pulled their flights in recent years.
Stitches for Sanders: Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign said the Vermont senator has been treated at a walk-in clinic for a minor injury while campaigning in South Carolina.
Campaign spokesman Arianna Jones told reporters that Sanders cut his head on the edge of a glass shower door Friday and went to a walk-in clinic.
She said Sanders, 77, received a half-dozen stiches and was given a "clean bill of health."
Jones said Sanders is continuing with all scheduled events, including a roundtable on health care, in South Carolina.
Sanders will travel to Nevada ahead of his first rally in the early voting state since launching his presidential bid. The rally will be held Saturday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Students across a warming globe pleaded for their lives, future and planet Friday, demanding tough action on climate change.
From the South Pacific to the edge of the Arctic Circle, students in more than 100 countries walked out of classes to protest what they see as the failures by their governments.
More than 150,000 students and adults who were mobilized by word of mouth and social media protested in Europe, according to police estimates. But the initial turnout in the United States did not look quite as high.
"Borders, languages and religions do not separate us," Havana Chapman-Edwards, 8, who calls herself the tiny diplomat, told hundreds of protesters at the U.S. Capitol. "Today we are telling the truth and we do not take no for an answer."
The "school strikes" were inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, 16, who began holding solitary demonstrations outside the Swedish parliament last year.
Since then, the weekly protests have snowballed from a handful of cities to hundreds, fueled by headlines about the impact of climate change during the students' lifetime. Unless emissions of heat-trapping gases start dropping dramatically, scientists estimate that the protesters will be in their 40s and 50s, maybe even 30s, when the world will reach dangerous levels of warming that international agreements are trying to prevent.
Thunberg, who has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, said at a rally in Stockholm that the world faces an "existential crisis, the biggest crisis humanity ever has faced and still it has been ignored for decades."
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was inspired by the student climate strikers to call a special summit in September to deal with what he called "the climate emergency."

French begin work on analysis of recorders in deadly jet crash
HEJERE, Ethiopia - Analysis of the flight recorders of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines plane has begun, the airline said Friday, and The New York Times reported that the pilot requested permission "in a panicky voice" to return shortly after takeoff as the plane dipped up and down and appeared to gain startling speed.
President Donald Trump in a phone call with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed praised the state-owned airline "as a strong institution" and affirmed U.S. support after Sunday's plane crash killed 157 people, Abiy's office said.
The Times report cited "a person who reviewed air traffic communications" as saying controllers noticed the plane was moving up and down by hundreds of feet.
French authorities have said it is unclear whether data could be retrieved from the recorders.

EPA bans consumer sales of paint stripper linked to deaths
WASHINGTON - The Environmental Protection Agency is banning consumer sales of a paint stripper after personal appeals by families of men who died while using the product.
The final rule announced Friday bars the manufacture and import of consumer products containing methylene chloride.
The EPA is urging consumers not to use it.
The consumer bans begin 180 days after the rule is published. The EPA says it expects retailers to implement it sooner. The rule doesn't affect commercial uses.
California says it's tracked at least five deaths since 2014 among people overcome by the fumes from methylene chloride.
Families of victims had met with Trump administration officials and lawmakers urging the ban.

Senate to probe if DOJ officials discussed removal of Trump
WASHINGTON - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham says his panel will investigate a claim by former FBI Director Andrew McCabe that Justice Department officials once discussed using the Constitution's 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office.
McCabe has said that after former FBI Director James Comey was fired in May 2017, officials at the department, including McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, discussed bringing the Cabinet together to consider using the amendment to remove Trump. The Justice Department said in February that department leaders did not believe there was any basis for invoking the 25th Amendment.
Graham sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr.

High court expands April 23 census arguments
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court will try to resolve all the legal issues about a citizenship question on the 2020 census.
The justices Friday are expanding their April 23 arguments to include whether asking about citizenship would violate the Constitution's call for a once-a-decade count of all people, not just citizens. The court was considering whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add a citizenship question is arbitrary and capricious under federal law.
The court is hearing the Trump administration's appeal of a federal judge's ruling in New York that the decision violated federal law. A judge in California said a citizenship question also would violate the Constitution.
A final answer about a citizenship question is needed soon to allow printing of the census questionnaire.

U.S. airline cites safety in halting flights to Venezuela
FORT WORTH, Texas - American Airlines is stopping flights to Venezuela because of safety concerns after the pilots' union told its members to refuse to work the flights.
American was the last major U.S. carrier to fly to the troubled country. It flew daily to Caracas and Maracaibo from Miami.
The airline said Friday that it temporarily stopped the flights as it evaluated conditions in Venezuela, where civil unrest has increased amid opposition to President Nicolas Maduro.
The airline's decision followed a union president's order Thursday night that American Airlines pilots refuse Venezuela assignments.
United Airlines and Delta Air Lines stopped flying to Venezuela in 2017, and several foreign carriers have also pulled their flights in recent years.

Stitches for Sanders: Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign said the Vermont senator has been treated at a walk-in clinic for a minor injury while campaigning in South Carolina.
Campaign spokesman Arianna Jones told reporters that Sanders cut his head on the edge of a glass shower door Friday and went to a walk-in clinic.
She said Sanders, 77, received a half-dozen stiches and was given a "clean bill of health."
Jones said Sanders is continuing with all scheduled events, including a roundtable on health care, in South Carolina.
Sanders will travel to Nevada ahead of his first rally in the early voting state since launching his presidential bid. The rally will be held Saturday.

Texto completo: The pilot of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jetliner that crashed in Ethiopia and triggered a global grounding of the vaunted planes immediately noticed trouble as the plane accelerated wildly after takeoff, the New York Times reported Thursday.
Citing an unnamed person who reviewed air traffic communication from Sunday's flight, the Times said air traffic controllers knew the plane was in trouble even before the pilot radioed in that he wanted to turn the plane around within three minutes of takeoff.
“Break break, request back to home,” the captain told air traffic controllers as they scrambled to divert two other flights approaching the airport. “Request vector for landing. ”

The final moments of the ill-fated flight, in which all 157 people on board died, are considered key to the investigation into Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 to Nairobi. The investigation has even more global significance because it could have bearing on when more than hundreds of Boeing 737 Max 8 jets, now grounded amid safety concerns, are allowed to return to the skies.
Air traffic controllers at Addis Ababa’s Bole International Airport received the call from Flight 302's pilot, Yared Getachew, as the plane's speed accelerated inexplicably. The plane also oscillated up and down by hundreds of feet, the Times reported.

More: From the flight manual to automation, why pilots have complained about Boeing's 737 MAX 8
The sudden speed bursts, which are seen in publicly available radar tracks of the plane before it crashed, and the oscillations in altitude are two of the mysteries that investigators are studying.
Within one minute of Flight 302’s departure, the person who reviewed communications said, Captain Getachew reported a “flight control” problem in a calm voice, the Times reported. At that point, radar showed the aircraft’s altitude as being well below what is known as the minimum safe height from the ground during a climb.
The plane appeared to stabilize and climbed to a higher altitude, but then began to speed up again in a way that is deemed unsafe.
The controllers, the person said, “started wondering out loud what the flight was doing," according to the Times. The plane then sped up even more and crashed within minutes.

Investigators on Thursday cautioned that they are a long way from determining the cause, which could take months. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders arrived Thursday in Paris, where French aviation authorities were tasked with probing the black boxes for clues to the tragedy.
France’s Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety, or BEA, said there was no immediate information on the condition of the recorders. Preliminary information could take several days to extract, the agency said.
Sunday's crash was the second of a Boeing 737 MAX in five months. In October, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed in the Java Sea 12 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people aboard were killed.
The 371 Boeing 737 Max jets flown around the world have been grounded pending further investigation. Also hanging in the balance are orders for more than 4,500 of the hot-selling planes.
Boeing has "paused" deliveries of the 737 Max but that production continues, said spokesman Paul Bergman on Thursday.
"Boeing is facing rough waters, or rough air, in the coming months," Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, told USA TODAY. "Look, you may or may not have a glitch in some sophisticated software. Some pilots were confronted with a challenge and were able to overcome it. Some were not. Why not? This is complicated. "
The Ethiopian Accident Investigation Authority sought help because of the sophisticated software involved. German aviation authorities said their technology was not designed for the new type of recorder used on the 737 Max jets.

Texto completo: Two years before the election of President Trump and the bitter politics of border walls, Muslim bans and s---hole countries, the American publishing industry was facing an identity crisis. A viral social media movement led by writers of color called #WeNeedDiverseBooks began pushing the industry to acknowledge and address its resounding whiteness. The failure to cultivate the voices of American writers of minority and immigrant backgrounds was the failure to tell a full national story, writer Junot Diaz explained in a New Yorker essay.
Soon after the 2016 election, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Viet Thanh Nguyen published a piece in The New York Times arguing that the outcome was partly the failure of writers. "The struggle over the direction of our country," he wrote, "is also a fight over whose words will win and whose images will ignite the collective imagination." Immigrants needed to tell their story - and tell it better.
"The Good Immigrant" is a culmination of the current political moment and a natural extension of the ongoing work to integrate American publishing. The 26 essays in this anthology are deeply personal reflections on adolescence, family, love and identity as experienced and felt by the American immigrant artist. From published heavyweights like Teju Cole and Alexander Chee to newer voices like Muslim American punk-rocker Basim Usmani and Pakistani Kashmiri-American poet Fatimah Asghar, this banquet of writing is a triumphant celebration of American multiplicity.
The book was inspired by an original British edition, which was published at the height of the Brexit debate with a largely different roster of writers. In the introduction to the American edition, the editors, Nikesh Shukla and Chimene Suleyman, explain that what both collections share is their desire to amplify the voices of immigrants through a kind of collective literary activism. In a cultural climate defined by xenophobia and anti-immigrant policies, this book seeks to showcase the gifts and humanity of immigrant artists.
It's a noble mission. And yet, as a reader, I worried that a collection defined by politics could crumble under the weight of good intentions. Essays lifted from social media outrage or powered by reactionary rage can satisfy in the instant but fade as the moment passes. Thankfully, this collection is a resounding success on multiple fronts. Its righteous rage is perfectly matched by its literary rewards.
The American edition of the "The Good Immigrant" is best heard as a surround-sound chorus that bristles with an unpredictable, electric energy. Language, style and rhythm shift with each piece, keeping our attention. In "Luck of the Irish," Maeve Higgins explores how white privilege helped her, an Irish immigrant living in the country illegally, as brown families in similar conditions are prosecuted. In a love letter to her mother, Indian-American writer Krutika Mallikarjuna finds humor in the ridiculous conundrum of dating in the multiracial mayhem of Brooklyn. "Of the many pitfalls of being a queer desi woman swimming through Tinder," she writes, "I never expected to find myself getting trashed in a bar trying to forget that I was on a date with a white girl named India."
Several of the essays are by first-time authors who work in other artistic mediums. My favorite essay is by Nigerian-American fashion designer Wale Oyejide. The African-inspired textiles and silhouettes of his celebrated fashion line Ikire Jones are regularly shown on global runways and featured prominently in the Oscar-winning blockbuster "Black Panther." In an essay about his artistic coming of age, Oyejide explores the struggles of stay-at-home fatherhood with biting humor and then widens his lens to a crisis of masculinity that fails to allow men to be more than conventional breadwinners and pursue the arts. He writes about his designs as a political instrument to restore dignity and beauty to black bodies draped in shades of violence and suffering in popular culture.
"Our uprisings don't always come in the guise of smashed windows, overturned cars or respectable slave owners forcibly torn from their stone housings in front of Capitol buildings. Sometimes they come in the form of building-sized brown faces broadcast on cinema screens, portraying characters who are miles away from the token mistress we have to come to accept for want of more inspiring alternatives," he writes. Immigrant creativity is about imagining new possibility, he explains: "There will be endless stories to write. And, increasingly, there will be audiences filled with us waiting to hear them being told."
The best work here offers reflections on the creative process, alongside the fear of family, society and failure that keeps many immigrant artists from expressing themselves. The collection concludes with a call to arms by novelist Jade Chang, with a practical step-by-step guide to embracing one's voice titled "How to Center Your Own Story."
As I finished "The Good Immigrant," my mind was buzzing with the multitude of voices, stories, heartbreaks and dreams featured in its 300-plus pages. The book is a welcome corrective to the nationalist calls for walls, borders and exclusion that seek to narrow the boundaries of what it means to be American. Each essay is a tantalizing introduction - and invitation - to the larger body of work these artists have already created and will continue to make long after this moment passes.

Texto completo: Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
Pop & Rock
ANTIBALAS at Brooklyn Bowl (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). This Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band is celebrating 20 years together with a two-night run, during which they will perform the kind of large-ensemble party music -- think a vibrant horn section and multiple percussionists -- that's made them so irresistible for the past two decades. Their work incorporates dub, funk and jazz, creating a rich, textured version of the kind of global dance sound that's become increasingly popular over the course of their career. On Friday, the music collective Innov Gnawa will open, and on Saturday, the hip-hop group Poetic Thrust will kick things off.

GARY CLARK JR. at the Beacon Theater (March 21-23, 8 p.m.). As a gifted blues guitarist, this Austin, Tex., native could easily stick to traditional sounds. But Clark continues to make songs that are expansive and forward-looking. He channels his remarkable technical ability toward hard-edge, political and genre-bending music that is nevertheless rooted in the blues, or at least its angst and earnestness. On his most recent album, "This Land," he tackles racism and American politics through tunes that are anything but easy listening -- and all the better for it.

GUSTER at the Beacon Theater (March 16, 8 p.m.). Since the members of this alternative rock band met during orientation at Tufts University in 1991, they have made consistently upbeat and pleasantly eccentric albums. Their latest, "Look Alive," is their first release in four years, but their enthusiasm hasn't dulled -- at least if the album's bright, polished, synth-driven indie-pop track list is any indication. Its sound is as approachable and harmony-rich as that of the songs that earned the still-independent band spots on mainstream soundtracks like "The O.C." and "Wedding Crashers."

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
HABIB KOITÉ at Le Poisson Rouge (March 15, 8 p.m.). A virtuosic guitarist, Koité has cultivated his own niche within the string-rich musical culture of his native Mali. He uses unorthodox tunings and incorporates a global mix of flamenco and blues into his interpretation of dansa, a traditional form of Malian music from his hometown, Kayes. The resulting sound has reached international audiences and gained fans like Bonnie Raitt. Perhaps best known for his approachable 1998 album, "Ma Ya," Koité, 61, continues to act as an ambassador of Mali's music.
212-505-3474, lpr.com
LOUDON WAINWRIGHT III at Sony Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). You might have already seen this show -- it's the live version of Wainwright's recent Netflix special, "Surviving Twin," which itself is the filmed version of a one-man set he's been performing since 2013. "Surviving Twin" takes its title from a Wainwright song of the same name, which is about the singer-songwriter's relationship with his father, Loudon Wainwright Jr.; the show, though, is about relationships between fathers and sons more broadly, including Wainwright's son and fellow performer, Rufus.

DALE WATSON AND KINKY FRIEDMAN at Union Pool (March 16, 7 p.m.). Two Texas titans visit Brooklyn this week to perform a brand of country music that's so traditional, it has made them outsiders. Watson favors a polished rockabilly shuffle that sounds straight out of the 1960s, while Friedman tempers his irreverent, occasionally profane tunes with twangy guitar and banjos. Both are beloved for their willingness to buck trends (and any chance of mainstream success) and deftly play country music that transports listeners anywhere -- even in Williamsburg -- to an old-fashioned honky-tonk.

Jazz
CARLA BLEY TRIO at Jazz Standard (March 19-20, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Unlike her compositions -- a lovable admixture of American folk songs, avant-garde jazz, soft rock and Romanticism -- Bley, at age 82, remains a rather inaccessible figure. She doesn't tour often, and she has long preferred the scholarly remove of a composer's identity to the more public one of a bandleader. All of which makes this appearance, featuring her longstanding trio (Bley on piano, Steve Swallow on bass and Andy Sheppard on saxophones), something especially worth seeking out.
212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com
MARÍA GRAND at Roulette (March 21, 8 p.m.). A dauntless young tenor saxophonist whose concept and ambition seem to grow broader by the week, Grand is unwilling to accept anything as a given -- stylistically, culturally, whatever. This concert, which she has titled "Music as a User's Manual," is meant to upend the passive relationship between audience and performance. How will she achieve this? That, presumably, depends on you as much as on her. But we know this: The first portion of the night will feature Grand alone, on saxophone and vocals; she'll then be joined by Ganavya Doraiswamy on vocals, Joel Ross on vibraphone and Rajna Swaminathan on mridangam, for a separate set.

LARRY GRENADIER at Zürcher Gallery (March 15, 8 p.m.). A leading jazz bassist since the 1990s, when he was a member of Brad Mehldau's watershed trio, Grenadier recently put out his first solo-bass recording, "The Gleaners." The album feels like a peek into a private world, as if you're discovering the poems of a great writer who was known only for his essays. (In actuality, it's inspired by film: specifically, Agnes Varda's famed documentary about potato harvesters, "The Gleaners and I.") For much of the record Grenadier focuses on arco playing, showing great range: He can use the bow to create spritzed, lively rhythms or a luminous, slow immersion. Abstraction would seem inherent to a solo-jazz-bass performance, but there's nothing dreamlike about this album; his sound is as direct and powerful as it is elegant.

THANDISWA MAZWAI AND NDUDUZO MAKHATHINI at the Africa Center (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). Mazwai is an A-list celebrity in South Africa, where she upholds a long tradition of politically engaged pop singing. She rose to prominence in the 1990s as the lead vocalist in Bongo Maffin, a famed group in the kwaito genre (a kind of house music). In the years since she has become known as a solo artist carrying on the legacies of Miriam Makeba, Brenda Fassie and other vocalists who blended jazz, pop and South African folk music. Here she appears alongside Makhathini, a young pianist with a thriving career as both a sideman and a solo artist, always guided by an attentiveness to music's potential for healing and renewal. This concert is presented as part of the Salon Africana series, which features performers chosen by the vocalist Somi.

CHARLES TOLLIVER at the Blue Note (March 14-17, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). A trumpeter with a strong, unvarnished attack, Tolliver launched his recording career in 1968 with the release of "Paper Man," an epochal record reflecting the blend of post-bop, psychedelic rock, salsa and increasingly militant funk being played around New York City at the time. He celebrated the 50th anniversary of the record's release last year in a triumphant performance at the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, and this weekend at the Blue Note he will reprise the reprisal once again. In addition to the alto saxophonist Gary Bartz -- who was in the quintet that recorded the original album -- he will be joined by the pianist Vijay Iyer, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Lenny White.

'UNFORGETTABLE: THE MAGIC OF NAT KING COLE' at Flushing Town Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). The pianist and vocalist Nat King Cole -- who died in 1965, at the height of his fame -- would have turned 100 on Sunday. In honor of his life and legacy, the svelte and subtly inventive vocalist Sachal Vasandani will interpret songs from Cole's repertoire with an all-star band: Shai Maestro on piano, Reuben Rogers on bass and Obed Calvaire on drums.

Times Talks
KAREN O AND DANGER MOUSE at Florence Gould Hall (March 20, 7 p.m.). Jon Pareles, chief pop music critic for The New York Times, hosts an evening of music and conversation with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs frontwoman Karen O and the musician and producer Danger Mouse. On Friday, the duo will release "Lux Prima," their first-ever collaboration. The audience will get to hear a selection of songs from the album during this discussion.

Howard Universtiy Professor Ivory Toldson Fights Misleading Statistics About Blacks

Texto completo: Howard University professor Ivory Toldson has dedicated his career to debunking statistics about the lack of achievement among Black people, an effort that has culminated in his new book, "No BS (Bad Stats): Black People Need People Who Believe in Black People Enough Not to Believe Every Bad Thing They Hear about Black People."
Toldson chuckles at the length of the title, but it explains a myth-telling premise about which the reader doesn't have to scratch his or her head.
Toldson, who holds a doctorate in counseling psychology, said the book was spurred partly by research he conducted for a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation study in the early 2000s called "Breaking Barriers," which looked at academic success factors for Black males.
The professor said he was alarmed by many articles in prominent news outlets such as the Baltimore Sun and the New York Times that showed Black boys at the bottom of the academic success scale. With his background in academia and experience within Georgia's the criminal justice system, he began looking at specific indicators on how Black males compared with males from other races.
The research caused Toldson to not focus on areas where Black males appeared to struggle, instead focusing on areas where they thrived.
"I started to look at Black males that were doing well, despite the odds," he said. "Then I looked at high performing young Black males compared to those that needed more assistance to see how we can close the gap."
Toldson's objective was to end uneven comparisons of Black males to White males. The result for the "Breaking Barriers" study provided a new look at what it takes to create the best learning environment for Black males.
Myth-busting is a byproduct of Toldson's commitment to "No BS." The biggest, he said, is that there are more Black men in prison than in college - a myth long perpetuated though there currently are approximately 600,000 more Black males in college than in jail.
Toldson called the myth "the mother of all BS," humorously likening it to the Jheri Curl.
"They were both invented by White men, worn badly by Black people, and left a nasty stain on the shoulders of millions of Black men," he said.
The basis of the myth is from a 2002 report by the Justice Policy Institute, "Cellblocks to Classrooms," which was based on only 2,734 colleges in 2001 reporting their enrollment data. In 2011, the number of colleges reporting their stats to the U.S. Department of Education increased to 4,503. Other data-gathering groups have shown that in 2010, nearly 1.4 million Black males were enrolled in college.
Toldson also takes umbrage with using reading tests in determining someone's actual ability to read. For more than a decade, less than 15 percent of Black high school graduates have been proficient in reading, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. In fact, there's never been a time in the history of standardized testing that more than half of Black people have scored as proficient in reading.
According to Toldson, this is BS.
"We have to separate tests from test-takers, so we can develop real solutions for real students," he said. "There's absolutely nothing that a test of reading proficiency can tell you about a student's ability to read that you wouldn't know by, first, listening to the student read and, second, taking an inventory of their reading routines and habits."
However, many of the myths dispelled in "No BS" are ingrained in approaches to teaching and teachers themselves, Toldson said. When teachers and counselors talk to parents, some also begin to believe those myths about their children.
"I want to engage in a movement where we don't use these static data points to define the lives and experiences of Black people," he said. "We need to truly believe in Black people enough to get the best information, the most compassionate understanding and the most reasonable policies to advance our cause for all Black people to benefit."

Books on Navigating Life's Challenges and Getting Back on Course
HUNGER
Roxane Gay
In her phenomenally popular essays and long-running Tumblr blog, Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and body using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as "wildly undisciplined," Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care. In Hunger, she explores her past - including the devastating act of violence that acted as a turning point in her young life - and brings readers along on her journey to understand and ultimately save herself.
With the bracing candor, vulnerability, and power that have made her one of the most admired writers of her generation, Roxane explores what it means to learn to take care of yourself: how to feed your hungers for delicious and satisfying food, a smaller and safer body, and a body that can love and be loved - in a time when the bigger you are, the smaller your world becomes.
OLD IN ART SCHOOL: A MEMOIR OF STARTING OVER
Nell Painter
A history professor in her 60s takes a break from teaching at Princeton University to go to art school in this witty and perceptive memoir. After enrolling at Rutgers University in the fall of 2007, Painter (The History of White People), quickly immerses herself in her drawing and painting classes as she wryly observes her younger classmates "upholding art-school sartorial drama in bright yellow hair and piercings." She notes that her fellow students, who know far less of the world man she does, are better painters, and she explores how her thinking as a historian hobbles her as an artist.
Her "20th century eyes favored craft... narrative and meaning" while her 21st century classmates and teachers preferred die "DIY aesthetic" and appropriation from popular culture (e.g., cartoons, pornography). Painter goes on to attend graduate school at the Rhode Island School of Design, where she feels like a misfit as the oldest - and only black - student in her class, and is also unappreciated for her intellectual sophistication, though she ultimately develops her own aesthetic and confidence in her work. This is a courageous, intellectually stimulating, and wholly entertaining story of one woman reconciling two worlds and being open to the possibilities and changes life offers.
THE YEAR OF YES
Shonda Rhimes
The instant New York Times bestseller from the creator of Grey's Anatomy and Scandal and executive producer of How to Get Away with Murder shares how saying YES changed her life. "As fun to read as Rhimes s TV series are to watch" (Los Angeles Times). She's the creator and producer of some of the most groundbreaking and audacious shows on television today. Her iconic characters live boldly and speak their minds. So who would suspect that Shonda Rhimes is an introvert? That she hired a publicist so she could avoid public appearances? That she suffered panic attacks before media interviews?
With three children at home and three hit television shows, it was easy for Shonda to say she was simply too busy. But in truth, she was also afraid. And then, over Thanksgiving dinner, her sister muttered something that was both a wake up and a call to arms: You never say yes to anything. Shonda knew she had to embrace the challenge: for one year, she would say YES to everything that scared her.
THE BOOK OF JOY
Desmond Tutu and Dali Lama
Two spiritual giants. Five days. One timeless question. Nobel Peace Prize Laureates His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu have survived more than fifty years of exile and the soul-crushing violence of oppression. Despite their hardships - or, as they would say, because of them - they are two of the most joyful people on the planet.
In April 2015, Archbishop Tutu traveled to the Dalai Lama's home in Dharamsala, India, to celebrate His Holiness's eightieth birthday and to create what they hoped would be a gift for others. They looked back on their long lives to answer a single burning question: How do we find joy in the face of life's inevitable suffering? They traded inti mate stories, teased each other continually, and shared their spiritual practices. By the end of a week filled with laughter and punctuated with tears, these two global heroes had stared into the abyss and despair of our time and revealed how to live a life brimming with joy.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump often complains that he is the victim of "presidential harassment" — or, as he sometimes puts it, "PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!" The president’s adversaries, of course, dismiss his protests as self-interested whining. But the fact is, Trump has a point. He is the target of an extraordinary combination not just of federal law enforcement and congressional probes, but a long list of less-discussed but potentially consequential investigations by state and local prosecutors and regulators. Together, it adds up to a pile-on of unprecedented proportions — by and large the work of blue-state Democrats.
Recently the New York State Department of Financial Services, the agency that regulates the insurance business, issued what The New York Times called an "expansive subpoena" to Aon, the insurance broker for the president’s companies. The agency leapt into action after former Trump fixer Michael Cohen told the House that Trump had at some point inflated his assets to an insurance company. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and faces serious questions about the truthfulness of his latest testimony, supplied no details. None were needed. "The subpoena that was served on Aon contains no indication that the company or any of its employees engaged in misconduct," the Times reported. "Nor does it specify any possible wrongdoing that is the focus of the inquiry by state regulators." Also in New York, the State Department of Taxation and Finance announced last October that it is investigating Trump’s taxes going back at least 20 years.
Speaking of state law enforcement, the recent New York attorney general race was virtually a contest to see which candidate could vow to go after Trump the most aggressively. Outside of New York, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia are suing Trump, accusing him of violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Then there is the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, based in Manhattan. Prosecutors there are said to be investigating the Trump Organization’s finances, the funding of the Trump inauguration, and the funding of the Trump super PAC Rebuilding America Now. On Capitol Hill, Democrats have long viewed Trump’s tax returns as a sort of Holy Grail of Trump investigations. Beyond that, there is the House Judiciary Committee’s recent decision to demand documents from 81 people associated with Trump — a request so wide-ranging that even some Democrats worry that their party’s investigators have overreached.
The point is, the scrutiny directed at the president from all sides — not oversight of his administration or even investigations into his election — so far exceeds anything in the past that it could well qualify as presidential harassment. Democrats would no doubt respond that Trump is singularly corrupt, or that he brought it all on himself. He did not. What has happened is that Democrats, in Congress and in some key blue states, saw investigation as a way to weaken a president they never thought would be elected and want to ensure is not re-elected in 2020. And Trump, with the most extensive business history ever brought to the presidency, presented a lot of avenues of investigation. When he complains about harassment, he has a legitimate case to make.

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Tara Siegel Bernard , a personal finance reporter, discussed the tech she's using.
What are your most important tech tools for tracking budgets?
This may sound strange coming from a personal finance reporter, but I'm not a big fan of traditional budgets -- I don't think they work. I try to keep my own spending in check by taking the reverse approach. Instead of tracking every dollar, I focus on what we need to save for: retirement, college or some other goal. After you've automated your savings goals and created a bit of a cushion for emergencies, you're freer to spend without thinking too hard or feeling too guilty. It's an imperfect system, but it's better than a failed budget.
That method won't necessarily work in all situations, especially if you need to tackle debt or establish a stricter spending plan in retirement. And everyone can benefit from tracking personal spending, even if you do it only for a few months or check in only every quarter.
Mint has been around for a while, but it is still a solid way to take stock of where all of your money is going and whether your net worth is moving in the right direction. It also allows you to create a budget, and alerts you when you've spent too much. I use it infrequently, and there's usually at least one kink I need to work out whenever I log in; most recently, it counted all of my retirement accounts twice, which was kind of cruel.
Personal Capital, an investment advisory service, also has a robust free tool that tracks your spending, cash flow and retirement goals all in one place with minimal effort.
For people who want a more proactive approach to spending and whittling down debt, there's You Need a Budget. I've come across many people in my reporting who have attested that it's life-changing.
Which basic tools would you recommend for people to increase their savings and investments?
It's not so much a tool but a technology: automation. After you've settled on a low-cost investment provider such as Vanguard, automation is the surest way to set yourself up for success. Automate as much as you can -- your Roth I.R.A. contributions, your kids' 529 college savings accounts. If you have an employer-provided retirement plan like a 401(k), see if it will allow you to automatically increase the percentage you're saving each year. If not, set a date in your electronic calendar to remind you to revisit all of those amounts annually.
I also like the little revolution that the roboadvisers have started. They lean heavily on technology to help invest and manage your money, though more of them are increasingly integrating human advisers. Betterment and Wealthfront have free tools that will let you play with various goals and savings amounts to see how long it will take you to save what you need.
What money apps do you recommend for the younger set?
I have a 2-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son, who recently started asking me questions about how credit cards work and how much money we earn. Another day, we were in a bookstore and he wanted me to buy four new Dog Man and Captain Underpants books. All of this happened within a couple of weeks, so I took that as a cue.
There are a ton of money apps for children and teenagers, but I was hoping to find something to help him focus on developing patience and delaying gratification. Today, bags of groceries magically appear on our doorstep without any visible transaction. If we need something, we can just press a button -- as adults, we're a month removed from any consequences, and children are often completely unaware that there was any exchange at all. Stuff just arrives when you want it.
To help acquaint my son with the reality of how all of this works, I decided to pay him an allowance of $5 a week. Instead of putting it in physical "save, spend and give" jars, he's tracking the same categories on an iPad. I scanned a few different apps, but the simplicity of PiggyBot seemed well suited for younger children. He immediately set a goal to buy two of those books -- but he's going to have to wait nine weeks to get them. (I also told him that we could just go to the library.)
Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?
I live a pretty low-tech life. We listen to music through Sonos and watch television through a four-year-old Roku device, though we haven't entirely cut the cord because my husband is a soccer fan. I did recently learn that we can hand in our cable box and pay a little less, while keeping access to cable channels through Roku, though you lose the ability to record.
There are also several apps that I use daily or weekly. I always have roughly five dozen tabs open on my computer screen, as well as stories I come across on Twitter that I want to read later. To minimize the clutter, I save everything to the Pocket app, which I'll read on my commute. I also keep a to-do list on the iPhone "reminders" app.
I also love Ink and Postagram for turning my children's photos into cards for relatives, all from my aging iPhone 6s, which has started to shut down in the cold.
I have a long wish list of apps, but I really want more sophisticated tools that would help us become smarter consumers. I want to enter a product name into an app so it can assure me that we're not feeding our children weed killer in their oatmeal.
Lots of web writers talk about the so-called FIRE, which stands for "financial independence, retire early." People are retiring as early as their 30s. What do you think about this movement?
We can all learn something from folks like Mr. Money Mustache, who is credited with popularizing the idea of hyper-frugal, anti-consumerist living and saving a significant chunk of your salary so you can either retire early or pursue more rewarding work.
But the movement started with a lot of technology workers -- and it's a lot easier to save half your salary when you're a well-paid software engineer with health insurance and no debt. Sure, these folks had to exercise discipline and restraint. But they had the luxury of exercising that discipline; there are so many people living on much less and struggling to pay for health insurance, rent, child care and student loans or to keep full-time jobs with chronic conditions.
It also raises a lot of questions: How do they pay for health care? Will the money really last as long as they need it? A lot of research shows a portfolio may last around 30 years if you withdraw 4 percent of the initial retirement portfolio balance, and then adjust that dollar amount for inflation annually. So when you start looking at longer time horizons -- or a 50-year or 60-year retirement -- it's increasingly possible to run out of money if you don't make adjustments.
But it's easy to see why so many people find the movement intriguing and why it has become such a popular story line. You can't help but wonder what it took to achieve financial security so early, so you click and hope to learn something.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

More U.S. Catholics ponder exit from church

Texto completo: New round of abuse scandals having deeper impact, Gallup poll says
Laura Hogan's past and present are Catholic. The Vienna, Va., woman has three Catholic immigrant grandparents, went to Catholic schools through college, and works to help those converting at the parish where her 10-year-old son goes to school. The church sexual abuse crisis in the early 2000s rattled her Catholic identity but did not uncouple it.
This time may be different.
Hogan is among the 37 percent of Catholics in a Gallup poll released Wednesday who say the current clergy sexual abuse crisis has them questioning whether to stay - a 15-point leap since the same question was asked in 2002, when the crisis first exploded in Boston, where Hogan lived at the time.
"I am different. I am older," she says of why she now feels very much on the fence. "I have two children and have seen one of them almost grown, and watched their friends and cousins grow. How can I look one of those children in the face if he or she is gay and say, 'No, you can't be fully yourself in the Catholic Church'? Or tell a girl she can't be a priest simply because of how she was born?" she wrote in an email.
An explosive grand jury report about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church released last August in Pennsylvania produced in her a disappointing feeling of deja vu, and more, she said.
Even as the sacraments have grown in importance to her, and even as she can rattle off Catholic figures living and dead to whom she looks for inspiration, Hogan is fed up.
"The hierarchy has betrayed us, and has gone on the defensive, when healing from betrayal requires accountability and transparency. I dream of my church dropping the defensiveness, displaying true, abject penitence in the face of the horrors of child sexual abuse and adult sexual coercion, and devoting itself to the humble service of those who have been harmed," Hogan said.
Misconduct by priests and the handling of the matter by clergy all the way up to the papacy exploded anew as a topic in the U.S. church last summer when scandals began to rock the denomination, the country's largest.
Experts on the polling of Catholics say that considering leaving is not the same as leaving. Also, polling experts say, the current crisis is unfolding as religious identity is becoming more fluid for tens of millions of Americans, so Catholics' leaving the option open cannot be wholly attributed to anger over clerical abuse and the handling of it. But Gallup's finding is a striking data point, pollsters say.
"As an indication of frustration, it seems like a pretty significant step," said Jeff Jones, a Gallup Poll senior editor. "Leaving is another one, and we don't have good data on that. But it does give a sense of the impact [the scandal] is having. And that the impact is greater than it was in 2002."
Gallup in recent months has been tracking how U.S. Catholics see the church.
The poll about potentially leaving, which was conducted in January and February, also found that a quarter of Catholics said they had very little or no confidence in their U.S. bishops ("and other Catholic leaders in this country") and said the same about American priests. They have double the confidence levels, Gallup found, in their own parish priests and in Pope Francis.
A December Gallup poll looking at views of "honesty and ethical standards" in different fields found that a record-low 31 percent of U.S. Catholics ranked clergy as having "high or very high" standards. That was down from 63 percent a decade ago and was a drop of 18 percentage points from 2017.
In the past decade, the percentage of U.S. Protestants who gave high or very high rankings for the ethics of their clergy dropped from 61 percent to 48 percent, Gallup found.
Yet polling on an issue as complex as switching religious identity has shown widely varying results. A CBS News-New York Times poll in 2010 asked U.S. Catholics whether the abuse issue was pushing them to consider leaving - at a time when the crisis in the American church was not significantly in the news. Nine percent said yes, and 86 percent said no. When CBS asked the question in October, 26 percent said yes, and 70 percent said no.
In the period between CBS's fall poll and Gallup's survey last month, the church was hammered with a slew of negative, dramatic news, including a frustrating national meeting of U.S. bishops, during which a major vote on abuse reform was delayed, and the historic defrocking of a cardinal.
In the thick of it are people like Hogan. As a younger person, she was so fascinated by the rituals, prayers and saints that she became an expert in religious art history. Now, at Our Lady of Good Counsel Catholic Church in Vienna, she is part of a group organizing to demand accountability from bishops.
Even with all that, the new crisis finds her starting to mentally envision shifting to another part of Christianity ("I'll still be under Jesus' umbrella"), and she says she would be completely accepting if her older son, who is about to head to college, left the family faith.
Among the factors that could persuade her to stay would be the Catholic Church's stopping its lobbying against extending the statute of limitations for victims of abuse to sue.
Though more than a third of Catholics told Gallup that the recent news about sexual abuse of young people by priests had them personally questioning whether to remain Catholic, 62 percent said it had not.
John Carr, a longtime official with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and an advocate for the church on Capitol Hill, said he sees Catholics separating the creed from the power brokers.
"People are asking, 'Why am I a part of something so broken?' Other people are saying, 'I'm not going to let this define my faith,' " said Carr, who heads a center that provides lectures and programs on understanding and improving the church. "For some of us, it has deepened our faith in Jesus and tested our faith in the church. You go back to basics in times of trouble, and we're in big trouble."
An area of vulnerability for the U.S. Catholic Church is growth. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey said 59 percent of people raised Catholic retain their Catholic identity - a retention rate similar to other major traditions - but the church stands out for its dearth of new members. Thirteen percent of Americans are former Catholics, and 2 percent have become Catholic. The large-scale survey found a 6.5-to-1 ratio of people leaving Catholicism to those joining it.
The U.S. church has held its place in terms of size, in large part because of Latino immigration. Roughly 20 to 25 percent of Americans identify as Catholic, according to various surveys, and have for decades. The question is how the growth of the Latino church here will affect Catholics' views. But Gallup said its sample pool was not large enough to assess disparities in views on the basis of race or ethnicity.
Most people who left Catholicism do not say sexual abuse scandals were a factor. A 2008 Pew survey found that fewer than 3 in 10 former Catholics said the clergy sexual abuse scandal was a factor in their decision to leave. Fewer than 1 in 20 volunteered the issue as a primary reason they left. But concern is growing.
The Rev. Bryan Small, pastor of Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Decatur, Ga., said he is especially worried about a younger generation of Catholics. He said that just one parishioner has told him he was planning to leave the church, but Small fears there are others who quietly feel the same.
"The scandal is not driving away the current leadership but [it is] the next generation," Small said. "That has me concerned and scared, to be honest."

How to find out if your flight is a grounded Boeing Max 8 or 9 airplane

Texto completo: President Donald Trump in an emergency ordered grounded two Boeing airplane types Wednesday, March 13, including the 737 Max 9 and Max 8.
After Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash killed 157 people, several nations barred the Boeing 737 Max 8. Until Trump’s announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration had said that it didn’t have any data to show the jets are unsafe.
Trump cited “new information” had come to light in the ongoing investigation into the incident. He didn’t elaborate.
Travelers who need to check flight status and aircraft type can do so a couple of ways. First, check your ticket to determine the aircraft type. It’s often listed as “equipment.”
Flight tracking websites also can help determine what’s flying at any given moment. For example, FlightAware.com shows United 1117, operating a Boeing 737 Max 9, is due to land at LAX by 2:22 p.m. The site said the flight, with the aircraft type listed as “B39M,” is running 8 minutes late. Two other Max 9 aircraft (United 2373 and 417) and were heading to the Hawaiian islands from LAX.
A more generic search for the Max 8 aircraft (listed as aircraft type B38M) shows dozens of the twin-jet airplanes in the sky worldwide.
The travel website kayak.com told MarketWatch it would begin including aircraft type.
If you want to switch flights based on the assigned aircraft, be warned: That will most often come with steep flight-change fees.
Trump’s order to ground the two aircraft types came hours after Canada’s transport minister said newly available satellite-tracking data suggested similarities between the crash in Ethiopia and another accident last October. In a statement released after Trump’s announcement, the FAA also cited “newly refined satellite data” as supporting the decision to ground the jets, the New York Times reported.

Texto completo: Tracy Stuber waited a long time to have her own restaurant.
And now, finally, she's the boss.
Stuber, a New York native, started working in the food business at a pizzeria when she was 14. From there she went on to waitress and bartend, with a pause to raise her kids. After moving to Southwest Florida from a town outside Syracuse, she worked at a series of restaurants — Fletchers, Coconuts and then Woody's — before deciding it was finally time to get her own place.
In September 2018, she bought Cape Coral's Paradise Deli & Grill.
"It's a big difference," Stuber said of owning a restaurant versus working there, "but I love it. Now it's mine."
Being a restaurant owner comes with the good and the bad.
"There are bigger headaches," she said, "and now the headaches are mine. I can't just call the owner and go, 'Here you go.'"
Still, Paradise Deli felt like the right fit for Stuber. She had been talking with the deli's former owners, Chris and Glee Ann Agius, laughing that each of the places she'd worked for had closed down or sold after a couple of years.
"I told them I wanted to do my own thing, and they said they were thinking of selling," Stuber explained.
If she were younger, she said, she might consider starting her own place from scratch. But, at 47, she's happy to have a restaurant with an established location, menu and customer base.
Stuber took over Paradise Deli last fall, and she's kept the place mostly the same. Some small changes are the hours — it's now open until 8 p.m. Monday to Friday — and a few menu items such as the Friday night prime rib dinner for two for $20. On Mondays she offers $6 tacos, on Tuesdays she has homemade meatloaf, and on Wednesdays it's shepherd's pie.
Paradise is much more than just a deli. There are tables with servers, and there's also a convenience market and lottery tickets for sale.
As time goes by, Stuber has added her touches to the place.
Dogs are welcome on Paradise's patio, and she's even created a special doggy menu. Fido friendly dishes include a chicken, rice, carrots and peas bowl; an eggs and bacon bowl; and the meatloaf with an egg in the middle and fries. There's even vanilla ice cream and doggy biscuits for dessert.
Stuber is passionate about animals, especially animal rescue. She has two rescue dogs of her own, and in her spare time she makes and donates doggy beds.
"Anything I can do for animals, I do," she said.
Like many who make their way to this part of Florida, Stuber and her family came seeking better weather. They knew they wanted to be on the Gulf side of the state in a place that stayed warm all year round, so they looked at North Port, Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte.
None felt quite right.
"My customers up north were snowbirds," Stuber explained, "and they said, 'You got to check out Cape Coral.'"
In 2012 her family visited the Cape, and in 2013 they moved down permanently.
"I love Cape Coral," Stuber said. "It was the only place we really liked. When we found it, we said, 'This is the place we're going to die.'"
Here's hoping for a long life — for Stuber and Paradise Deli.

Texto completo: La nueva fiscal general estatal de Nueva York, Letitia James, envió citaciones a Deutsche Bank e Investors Bank el lunes por los registros que involucraban la fallida oferta del mandatario Donald Trump para comprar el equipo de fútbol americano “Buffalo Bills” y otros negocios relacionados con la Organización Trump.
Un día después de emitir las citaciones, James pidió a los legisladores en Albany cerrar la “laguna” legal que prohíbe a los fiscales del estado presentar cargos similares contra personas indultadas por cargos federales.
“Tenemos un acuerdo en ambas casas, anticipamos que el proyecto de ley se aprobará en un par de semanas”, dijo a New York Post.
La citación del Deutsche Bank investiga solicitudes de préstamos, hipotecas, líneas de crédito y otros registros de transacciones financieras relacionadas con el Trump International Hotel en Washington, el Trump National Doral en el sur de Florida y el Trump International Hotel and Tower en Chicago , informó The New York Times.
Se le pidió a Investors Bank, con sede en Nueva Jersey, registros relacionados con Trump Park Avenue.
James también ha solicitado registros vinculados por los intentos de Trump de comprar los “Buffalo Bills” en 2014. El acuerdo se vino abajo después de que Terry Pegula, propietario del equipo de hockey Buffalo Sabres, compró el equipo de la NFL por $1,400 millones de dólares.
James, quien prometió en su campaña investigar al presidente, inició el proceso civil luego de que Michael Cohen, antiguo abogado de Trump, testificara ante un panel del Congreso el 27 de febrero.
En el Congreso se están realizando varias investigaciones sobre Trump, sus negocios y su campaña, y por el asesor especial Robert Mueller.
Deutsche Bank confirmó a The New York Times que había recibido la citación, pero Investors Bank se negó a comentar. La Organización Trump no respondió a las solicitudes de comentarios del periódico.
En febrero, una coalición de 16 fiscales generales, incluyendo a James por NY, presentó una demanda contra Trump, en un intento por frenar la “emergencia nacional” con la que el mandatario busca recaudar fondos para construir el muro en la frontera con México.

Texto completo: Dick's Sporting Goods announced Tuesday it will remove firearms from 125 of its stores, according to news reports. The move follows the company's ban on assault-style weapons last year in the wake of the Parkland shooting.
CEO Ed Stack said Tuesday that Dick's will pull hunting gear from 125 stores starting in around August in response to its slumping sales in those stores, Bloomberg reported, a move that may spread to more stores next year.
Dick's last year announced it would ban sales of assault-style weapons after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and revelations that its shooter, Nikolas Cruz, had purchased a gun from a Dick's store. The company also halted sales of high-capacity magazines and guns to anyone under 21 years old.
Hunting products started vanishing from 10 Dick's stores last fall as the retailer swapped those items for products such as kayaks and baseball gear. Stack said the stores saw higher sales, margins and foot traffic than when they had guns, according to Bloomberg.
Halting assault-style weapon sales put a dent in overall sales for Dick's, the company noted last fall, a dip furthered by a weaker gun market. On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh-area company said net income for the quarter fell to $102. 6 million from $116 million in the year-earlier period, per MarketWatch.
Adjusted same-store sales fell 3. 1 percent over a 12-month period ending Feb. 2 when compared to that period the year prior, The New York Times reported.
Dick's operates 729 stores along with 94 Golf Galaxy stores and 35 Field and Stream stores, according to the newspaper.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation expelled Dick's from membership last year for "conduct detrimental" to the firearms trade group, but Stack remains undeterred in the company's direction.
"If we had a mulligan, we'd do it all over again," Stack said, per CNBC.
The CEO signed a letter last month backing a federal bill extending background checks, the network noted, and recently joined the Everytown business council for gun safety.

Fresh-made cheese and crusty sandwiches at Bufarella market; Bite-sized review

Texto completo: A TV show I can't remember once had a line I'll never forget: "What's life without cheese? Longer." The freshly made mozzarella, burrata and stracciatella at Bufarella Italian market in Oakland Park are so good, I dare say it's worth sacrificing a few months of lifespan to eat.
The orbs of mozzarella and burrata and streaks of stracciatella are as white as alabaster, smooth as a baby's bottom, and taste as pure as mother's milk, if mother were a water buffalo. Crusty sandwiches, made with fresh mozzarella, quality Italian cold cuts and crunchy, chewy hunks of ciabattina from Gran Forno bakery in Fort Lauderdale, are also tremendous.
After plowing through two sackfuls of goodies from the small store, I had a dual reaction of elation and regret. Elation because the products are outstanding. Regret because I had not made my way to Bufarella sooner. And because my arteries were groaning.
Bufarella Genuine Italian Gourmet opened in August 2018, a 1,200-square-foot space tucked in a corner of a strip shopping center on East Oakland Park Boulevard between Federal and Dixie Highways. It was opened by three longtime friends, including Franco Godina, a veteran restaurateur who once owned Caffe Milano on South Beach.
"I love cheese," says the Italian-born Godina, 70. "And I could never find a mozzarella that I liked in South Florida."
Now he has one. The mozzarella fior di latte ($5 each), made from cow's milk, has perfect texture and saltiness. Burrata ($10 for 8 ounces), with a firm and spongy shell that gives way to an oozy, creamy interior, is superb. Stracciatella ($5 for 8-ounce container, $7 flecked with grated black truffle) is striated with fresh, milky curds and stretches to an Instagrammable cheese pull when lifted with a fork. It's wonderful atop salad or crusty bread.
The cheeses are so good because they are made in house daily by Domenico "Mimmo" Marchitelli, a master Italian cheesemaker for 35 years originally from Puglia, the birthplace of burrata. He came to South Florida 15 years ago, worked at Mozzarita in Pompano Beach, and then went to Maplebrook Farm in Vermont, where his cheeses won awards and were spotlighted in the New York Times and Boston Globe. Marchitelli returned to South Florida a few years ago.
Buffarella has a tiny counter area and three small high-top tables along the window. Most customers buy cheese to take home, and the store also draws a small but steady takeout lunch crowd. Godina says the store sells 40-50 sandwiches daily. I imagine it gets claustrophobic if more than a half-dozen people are inside. Patience is required, since there's only one meat slicer and the store refuses to pre-make sandwiches. The place is immaculate, with a display case filled with cheeses, meats and mini-cannolis, and a poster-size photo of a water buffalo near the register.
When I walked in, the greeting was so warm I felt as if I had left South Florida. Azia, the front-counter clerk from Bologna, insisted I try samples as I waited for my sandwiches. I chewed on a nodini, a mini-mozzarella that looks like a little teardrop, and nibbled on other smoked and hard cheeses.
Sandwiches ($8-$11), called panini even though they aren't grilled or pressed, are impressive. They are among the best I've eaten in Broward. I still love La Mia Focaccia in Fort Lauderdale for its soft, pillowy bread, but Bufarella wins in the hefty, crunchy category. Meats and mozzarella slices are stacked on the ciabattina (mini loaves of ciabatta), then dusted with arugula, tomato and other add-ons such as roasted red peppers. The coppa (cured pork, $10.95) has a strong, funky taste. I preferred the prosciutto-speck combo ($10.95), which wasn't stringy and chewed easily.
I bought a few cannoli ($2), a miniature version pre-filled with ricotta that was light and creamy. The shells were a little too thick and the filling got lost.
Next time I'll know. Leave the cannoli, take the cheese.
Bufarella Genuine Italian Gourmet, 1682 E. Oakland Park Blvd., Oakland Park, 954-368-6286, BufarellaGourmet.com, open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday-Saturday, closed Sundays.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Timothy J. Sloan went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to convince members of Congress that Wells Fargo had become a better bank.
By the time he left, it was clear that few believed him.
Mr. Sloan, the bank's chief executive, fielded intense criticism during four hours of testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. Democrats and Republicans alike grilled Mr. Sloan, whose bank has tried to recover from a series of scandals in 2016, when it was revealed that Wells had been opening phantom bank accounts in customers' names and forcing unnecessary fees and products on some of them.
His responses managed to draw ire even from officials who weren't in the room: A spokesman for the bank's primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, released a statement on Tuesday saying officials were "disappointed" in the bank.
Mr. Sloan was the first in what is expected to be a parade of bank executives summoned to testify before the committee about the health of the industry now that Democrats control the House of Representatives. But their Republican counterparts also pulled few punches.
In his opening statement, Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, cited a New York Times article from last week about a persistent, high-pressure culture of performance goals at the bank, despite its work to reorganize itself. Mr. McHenry asked Mr. Sloan if he could promise that Wells would no longer harm customers.
"I can't promise you perfection, but what I can promise you is that the changes we've implemented since I've become C.E.O. will prevent harm the best we can," said Mr. Sloan, who took over as chief executive in October 2016.
Members of the committee repeatedly referred to the Times article as they questioned Mr. Sloan. Topics included goals set for employees responsible for collecting customer debt and an episode in which a financial adviser left the company only for the bank to erroneously inform her clients that she was teaming up with another employee to handle their accounts.
The letter indicated that the adviser still worked for the bank and had endorsed the other employee. A bank spokesman said last week that the letter had been sent in error.
"You can't assure us that there haven't been other letters like this?" asked Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York.
"There may have. I'm not aware," Mr. Sloan replied.
Other heads of big banks were likely taking note of Mr. Sloan's grilling. His counterparts, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, will appear at a committee hearing for the leaders of the biggest banks on April 10.
Representative Katie Porter, Democrat of California, questioned Mr. Sloan about exactly how meaningful the bank's commitment to change was, pointing out that its own lawyers had called such statements "corporate puffery" in response to a lawsuit.
"It's convenient for your lawyers to deflect blame in court, and say your rebranding campaign can be ignored as hyperbolic marketing, but when then you come to Congress, you want us to take you at your word," she said. "And I think that's the disconnect, that's why the American public has trouble trusting Wells Fargo."
In his opening remarks, Mr. Sloan described many of the changes Wells Fargo had made in an effort to rebuild that trust. "We have discarded our old decentralized structure that allowed prior problems to occur," he said.
The bank has eliminated the sales goals at branches that led employees to open fake accounts to meet regular quotas. He also said employees were being judged mainly on how they treated customers, rather than on how much they sold.
Mr. Sloan also said Wells Fargo was having "constructive" talks with its regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the comptroller office, both of which have imposed limitations on what the bank is allowed to do while it tries to reshape its culture and its operations.
Some of those officials, it seemed, were watching the hearing. The comptroller office, which regulates nationally chartered banks and has criticized Wells Fargo for forcing hundreds of thousands of customers to carry unnecessary car insurance, took the rare step of issuing a statement on Mr. Sloan's testimony. It said it was unhappy with the bank's "inability to execute effective corporate governance and a successful risk management program."
Committee members had pointed questions about the bank's treatment of customers.
Representative Lance Gooden, a Republican from Texas, asked why Wells Fargo was taking longer than expected to refund money to customers it had tricked into buying auto insurance. Mr. Sloan said the bank had engaged in "a give-and-take" with the comptroller about how much to refund.
Two Democrats, Representatives Brad Sherman of California and Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, asked Mr. Sloan about the bank's use of arbitration to settle disputes with customers.
"We've looked at more than 160 million accounts and contacted more than 50 million customers to make sure we've made things right, and I believe we have," Mr. Sloan said.
Representative Maxine Waters of California, the committee chairwoman, asked Mr. Sloan if the bank had become "too big to manage."
"No," he replied, "we're not."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: The Utah Jazz permanently banned a fan who they said aggressively taunted Russell Westbrook, one of the N.B.A.'s premier players, during a game Monday night in an incident that has prompted discussions about fan racism and player security.
Westbrook, the star guard of the Oklahoma City Thunder, said the fan directed "disrespectful" and "racial" comments toward him. "A young man and his wife in the stands told me to get down on my knees 'like you used to,' " Westbrook said.
In a video posted on Twitter by a reporter for The Deseret News, Westbrook, who is black, can be seen using expletives to say that he will beat up the fan, who appears to be white, and extends the threat to include the man's wife. The video is about 30 seconds long and does not show the full encounter or what prompted Westbrook, a guard for the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder, to react to the fan.
After the game, Westbrook told reporters that the man had said "disrespectful things" about him and his family that he thought were "racial" and suggested that the video posted online lacked important context.
He acknowledged that he had threatened to beat up the fan's wife but said he had "never put his hand on a woman" and "never will." He also stood by his actions, saying, "If I had to do it over again, I would say the same exact thing."
On Tuesday afternoon, the N.B.A. announced that it had fined Westbrook $25,000 "for directing profanity and threatening language to a fan." The announcement came shortly after the Jazz, in a statement, said the fan would be permanently banned from all events at Vivint Smart Home Arena because of "excessive and derogatory verbal abuse directed at a player." The team said it had conducted an investigation that included reviews of video and eyewitness accounts.
The confrontation between Westbrook and the Jazz fan -- who has presented a starkly different description of the episode -- is the latest in a series of incidents that spotlight how fans treat athletes and the sometimes explosive consequences that can result, issues that both Westbrook and the N.B.A. have frequently been at the center of.
"There's no protection for the players," Westbrook said in his postgame comments, which were transcribed by a reporter for The Salt Lake Tribune and later provided to The New York Times by the Thunder, who otherwise didn't comment on the incident. "I think there are a lot of great fans who like to come to the game and enjoy the game. And then there are people that come to the game to say disrespectful things about me, my family."
Westbrook's teammates backed his account of the interaction. Raymond Felton told reporters that he had overheard the comments made by the fan and said they were "totally disrespectful." Patrick Patterson appeared to confirm Westbrook's account of events on Twitter, and wrote that "fans are protected in every way possible but not us."
Multiple news outlets identified the Jazz fan as Shane Keisel. Keisel told ESPN that he did not swear at Westbrook or otherwise say anything inappropriate, and that he believed they were having fun. In an interview with local television station KSL, Keisel said Westbrook had been using profanity and "acting a fool," which fans responded to by heckling him.
Keisel said he saw Westbrook's knees wrapped in towels, so he told him to "sit down and ice your knees, bro." Westbrook responded that the wraps were for heat, Keisel said, adding that he then told Westbrook, "Well, you're going to need it." Keiser said the woman sitting next to him, who ESPN identified as his wife, Jennifer Huff, did not say anything to Westbrook and had her hands in her lap.
Attempts to reach Keisel on Tuesday were unsuccessful.
Keisel was sitting in the third row on the baseline, near the Thunder bench. Unlike in most other sports, in basketball fans can sit just a few feet away from players. This can lead to good-natured and spirited exchanges -- like the back-and-forth heckling between Spike Lee and Reggie Miller in the 1990s -- but also to large problems.
Most infamous is what is known as The Malice at the Palace in 2004. After a brawl between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit, a fan threw a drink at Ron Artest, a Pacers forward at the time who has since changed his name to Metta World Peace. Artest charged into the stands, followed closely by teammate Stephen Jackson, and threw a punch at a fan. Artest was suspended for 86 games, and five players eventually pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges.
Since the incident, the N.B.A. has taken numerous steps to prevent violence, especially between players and fans. Players are now automatically suspended if they leave the bench during an on-court altercation, and fans whose unacceptable conduct is overheard by or reported to security are issued cards warning them that they can be ejected from the arena.
In a statement after the game, the Jazz said arena security issued several warning cards to fans during the game.
Westbrook has had a number of run-ins with fans in the past, including in Salt Lake City. During last year's playoffs, Westbrook twice got into it with fans while leaving the court. The first time he stepped toward and yelled at a fan that was leaning over the railing talking to him; the second time Westbrook swiped at a phone that a fan had pushed toward his face.
"Here in Utah, a lot of disrespectful, vulgar things are said to the players here with these fans," Westbrook said after that game. Afterward, Jazz officials said that their arena security was adequate, and updated their in-arena video message about fan behavior.
Last month in Denver, a child sitting in the front row gave Westbrook a small shove as he landed out of bounds. Westbrook bent over and calmly spoke to a man nearby and the child, patting him on the knee and shaking his hand before returning to the game. "I told his dad, 'Be careful, man. You can't have your son just hitting random people,' " Westbrook said after that game.
Westbrook also pushed a fan who confronted him on the court after a game in Denver last year, and was fined $25,000 for shouting a vulgarity at a Dallas Mavericks fan in 2016.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Missed Target On Manafort Sentencing

Texto completo: The only way to justify the extraordinarily lenient sentence that federal Judge T.S. Ellis III bestowed Thursday upon Paul Manafort would be if the former Trump presidential campaign chairman had cooperated with investigators.
Not only did Manafort not cooperate; prosecutors contend that he lied to them after agreeing to cooperate.
Yet Ellis sentenced Manafort to 47 months in prison for his conviction on five counts of tax fraud, one count of failure to file a report of foreign bank and financial accounts and two counts of bank fraud.
As Scott Hechinger, a public defender in Brooklyn, put it in a tweet: “For context on Manafort’s 47 months in prison, my client yesterday was offered 36-72 months in prison for stealing $100 worth of quarters from a residential laundry room.”
Judges should have discretion to depart from the guidelines, and in 2017 they did so in fraud cases 43 percent of the time, according to analysis by The New York Times. But in most of those cases, judges honored the requests of prosecutors who recommended reduced sentences due to a defendant’s cooperation in an investigation.
Manafort faces a second sentencing Wednesday in a related case, before federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson, for which the maximum possible sentence is 10 years. The judge also can make the sentence consecutive to the first one.
The question of whether justice is served often is a moving target. In this case Ellis - by crafting a sentence more than four times lower than federal sentencing guidelines - missed regarding Manafort specifically and regarding fair sentencing, generally.

Texto completo: Un grupo de lectores, mayormente venezolanos, se reunió el lunes al mediodía frente al edificio del diario The New York Times para protestar lo que calificaron como política editorial “tendenciosa” y “desinformativa” sobre la crisis humanitaria y política que se vive en ese país suramericano.
En particular la protesta fue motivada por un reporte publicado el domingo donde acusaban a la oposición venezolana y el gobierno del presidente colombiano Iván Duque de ser responsables de la quema de un camión con ayuda humanitaria en la frontera el pasado 23 de febrero, acción que el mandatario Donald Trump adjudicó a seguidores de Nicolás Maduro, opuesto a la entrada de auxilio internacional en un tono hostil.
De hecho, la vicepresidenta de Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez, confesó al día siguiente que la violencia vivida en la frontera fue sólo “un pedacito de lo que nosotros estamos dispuestos a hacer”.
Pero The New York Times publicó que su investigación había determinado lo contrario. En el pasado, el diario neoyorquino, el más importante de Estados Unidos, se ha destacado por su crítica al gobierno de Trump, tanto en política interna como exterior.
Al bajar a conversar con los manifestantes, la reportera Deborah Acosta afirmó que lo publicado había sido producto de una investigación exhaustiva de análisis de videos, aunque admitió que la situación ese día fue confusa y que el diario estaba enviando más periodistas a la zona para cubrir la tensa situación.
Además del reporte en sí, los manifestantes cuestionaron que haya sido publicado justo el fin de semana, mientras en Venezuela se vivía una “situación desesperada” de muertes en hospitales, saqueos e incomunicación durante el mayor apagón en la historia del país; algo que, según ellos, The New York Times no había desplegado de manera proporcional “por su oposición permanente a Trump”, comentó la activista Gloria Requena.
Acosta insistió ante los presentes que el reporte se había publicado el domingo 10 de marzo porque fue entonces cuando habían concluido su investigación.
“¿Cómo se refieren ustedes a Guaidó?”, preguntó Acosta a los presentes sobre el presidente del Parlamento, que declaró ilegal el mandato de Maduro. A coro, la mayoría respondió: “Es el presidente encargado de Venezuela”. Y la reportera tomó nota.
“Pedimos al New York Times que dejen de usar nuestra crisis en su juicio político en Estados Unidos”, declaró a la agencia EFE Erick Rozo, coordinador en Nueva York del partido venezolano Voluntad Popular, al que pertenece el ingeniero Guaidó,
Rebeca Zambrano, miembro de la asociación “Independent Venezuelan American Citizens”, denunció que “en vez de hablar de cuánta gente está muriendo en Venezuela, de cuántos niños necesitaban esa ayuda, el New York Times decidió hablar de un video no concluyente”.
“Maduro dijo que no los iban a dejar entrar (los camiones con ayuda humanitaria), la canciller Delcy Rodríguez dijo que lo que vimos era sólo una muestra de lo que eran capaces de hacer”, resumió la activista, preguntándose entonces cómo en su reportaje el New York Times los eximió de culpa, por acción u omisión.
En septiembre pasado, un venezolano se desnudó frente a la sede del New York Times, también reclamando una cobertura a la crisis de su país que no fuese usada como excusa para juzgar a Trump.

Airline pilot: Is it still safe to fly in a Boeing 737 Max? Don't worry about it just yet.

Resumen: Recent crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft have passengers worried. But air travel has actually never been safer.

Texto completo: Last October, a Boeing 737 Max 8, operated by a low-cost Indonesian airline called Lion Air, crashed after takeoff from Jakarta, killing everyone on board. Then, on Sunday, an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed near Addis Ababa, under eerily similar circumstances, killing 157 people from more than 30 countries.
The million dollar question is whether these accidents are linked, and whether Boeing’s 737 Max, the newest and most sophisticated variant of its venerable 737 line, harbors a deadly defect.
Reports of the Lion Air crash point to a flaw in something called MCAS, which stands for Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, an automatic system designed to keep the plane's nose from pitching upward at too steep of an angle. The problem occurs when faulty data sense an impending aerodynamic stall when there isn't one, triggering the plane's stabilizer trim — stabilizers are the wing-like horizontal surfaces beneath the tail — to force the nose down.
Read more commentary:
Ethiopia crash of Boeing 737 Max might be latest example of backfiring safety efforts
Boeing: Safety will always be a core value
Have you gained or lost weight? Congrats, TSA is now tracking you for suspicious activity.
Essentially, evidence suggests that the Lion Air pilots lost control of their ability to maintain level flight and failed to recognize what was happening in time to disconnect the errant system.
Did the same thing happen in Ethiopia?
Grounding their Boeing 737 Max fleets
At this point it's impossible to know, but certainly things are pointing in that direction, and a growing number of countries are worried enough to have ordered the grounding of their carriers' 737 Max fleets. If the investigators do determine a link, there's quite a bit at stake — for the plane’s manufacturer, for the world's airlines and for the traveling public. Boeing will need to implement a fix, be it a hardware solution, a software solution or both, in a process that is likely to take weeks or longer.
In the meantime, is the Max safe to fly? The short answer is yes. Why the Ethiopian pilots didn’t simply override the errant MCAS, if in fact that’s what they were dealing with, isn’t understood. Perhaps, like the Lion Air crew before them, they were simply overwhelmed by a cascade of warnings, faulty messages and unstable aircraft movements.
But disconnecting the system is, or should be, pretty straightforward, and passengers can take some comfort in knowing that Max pilots everywhere, together with the various airline training departments, are acutely aware of the issue and how to deal with it.
The outright grounding of an aircraft model is unusual but not unprecedented. New jets are sometimes beset by technical issues in their early days of service. Normally these problems are minor, if expensive, nuisances (engine problems plagued the first 747s, for example). But there have been catastrophic instances too.
Despite headlines, air travel is remarkably safe
We remember the Comet, the world's first commercial jet, and the stress-crack disasters that led to its grounding and redesign. The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 was plagued by troubles from the start, including a poorly designed cargo door that killed 346 people in the horrific Turkish Airlines crash in 1974. Five years later, all DC-10s in the United States were grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration after the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 killed 271 people at Chicago's O’Hare International Airport — to this day, the deadliest crash ever on U. S. soil, excluding the 9/11 attacks. More recently, the 787's debut was marred by a series of battery fires.
For the airline passenger, these can seem like scary times. Air crashes, perhaps more than any other type of catastrophe, have a way of haunting the public’s consciousness, particularly when the causes are mysterious.
My best advice, maybe, is to take a step back and look at this through a wider lens. The fact is, Lion Air and Ethiopian notwithstanding, air travel has never been safer. Out of 35 million commercial global flights in 2017, only two ended in accidents resulting in deaths of passengers.
Since the Lion Air incident, two fatal crashes in five months is tragic, but in decades past it wasn’t unusual to see a dozen or more air disasters worldwide in a given year. Nowadays, two or more is downright unusual.
In the United States, there hasn’t been a large-scale disaster involving a mainline carrier in a decade — an absolutely astonishing statistic. There are far more planes, carrying far more passengers, than ever before, yet the accident rate is a fraction of what it once was. Despite the recent headlines and until we know more information, then, airline passengers should fly easy.

Eliza Dushku slams NDA from CBS' $9.5M payout: 'NDAs revictimize people'

Texto completo: Eliza Dushku is still upset about the sexual comments "Bull" star Michael Weatherly made about her on the set of the CBS legal drama and the culture that allowed it to happen.
In a new interview with Time, the actress, 38, says the non-disclosure agreement she signed as part of her $9. 5 million settlement means she has to "talk in code" when she wants to discuss the situation.
Her payout, first reported by The New York Times and confirmed to USA TODAY in December, was made during an investigation into the culture at CBS under Leslie Moonves, who resigned as CEO three months earlier amid multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.
In March 2017, Dushku, whose credits include "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "Dollhouse" and "Bring It On," signed on for three episodes at the end of the first season of "Bull" and was set to become a full-time cast member during the show's second season.
According to Time, Dushku confrontedWeatherly, who had graduated to top billing after 14 seasons on CBS' hit drama "NCIS," after he made sexual remarks. She said she was then written off of the show out of retaliation, but received the money after footage backed up her story.
“I guess what makes me angry is people knew. Important people knew,” she told Time “They could have done something. And they didn’t. ”
I was harassed 'for weeks': Dushku breaks silence on 'Bull' firing, CBS settlement
Dushku also expressed anger over the nondisclosure agreement she signed that barred her from discussing the case publicly.
“We’re talking in code," she said. "NDAs revictimize people. They give more power to the powerful. And as the less-powerful person, you have to live in someone else’s (messed)-up version of reality.
In the original Times story, Dushku complained of "disgusting" behavior by Weatherly, including comments about how he wanted to spank her and have a threesome within earshot of the cast and crew of 'Bull," which is now in its third season.
Weatherly told the Times that those comments, and another in which he called a windowless van "a rape van," were meant as jokes.
In a statement shared with USA TODAY, CBS said that the $9. 5 million figure reflected what Dushku would have made had she stayed on as a series regular.
Dushku has left Los Angeles and moved home to Boston, where she is now enrolled at Lesley University, a private college in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She is studying holistic psychology, part of her effort to turn her focus to healing others.
“I need the distance to recalibrate and start a family,” Dushku told Time. “But I don’t want people to think coming forward means ending your career. I could be acting. I could be in L. A. I just need to be here right now. ”
She made headlines last year when she revealed that she was molested by a stunt coordinator as a 12-year-old on the set of the 1994 film "True Lies. " The stunt coordinator, Joel Kramer, has denied the allegations. Director James Cameron has said that if he'd known about the allegations at the time, he would have shown "no mercy" toward the crew member.
Dushku linked that experience to her later drug and alcohol abuse, telling Time, “We carry trauma in our bodies. That’s where addiction comes in. People try to numb themselves. ”
According to the Time story, Dushku's addiction reached a point that her brother stopped letting her hang out with her niece. That wake-up call prompted her to seek help. She's been sober for a decade.

DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE OK WITH CAPITALISM BUT SOME ARE TURNING THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN HISTORY INTO A DIRTY WORD

Texto completo: John Hickenlooper ought to be a poster child for American capitalism. After being laid off from his job as a geologist during the oil bust of the 1980s, he and his business partners turned an empty warehouse into a thriving brewery. It launched his political career, first as a problem-solving two-term mayor of Denver, then as a pragmatic two-term governor of Colorado and now as a centrist candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Yet there he was on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," squirming in his seat as Joe Scarborough asked if he would call himself "a proud capitalist." Mr. Hickenlooper protested the divisiveness of labels. He refused to reject the term "socialism." He tried, like a vegetarian who still wants his bacon, to have it both ways: "There are parts of socialism, parts of capitalism, in everything."
But Mr. Hickenlooper did allow this: "We worked 70, 80, 90 hours a week to build the business; and we worked with the other business owners in [Lower Downtown Denver] to help them build their business. Is that capitalism? I guess."
He guessed right.
Today, despite Friday's disappointing jobs report, unemployment in the United States clocks in at a rock-bottom 3.8 percent. Wage growth, at 3.4 percent, is at a 10-year high. The median household income is as high as it has ever been. The United States is the world's most competitive economy, as well as the wealthiest once you exclude small countries like Qatar.
None of this should be difficult to celebrate. An economy in which private property is protected, private enterprise is rewarded, markets set prices and profits provide incentives will, over time, generate more wealth, innovation and charity - and distribute each far more widely - than any form of central planning.
This is not a theory. It's as true in Nordic countries like Denmark (often mislabeled "socialist") as it is in hyper-capitalist Singapore. It's the empirically verifiable conclusion from the 20th century's bitter contest between capitalist and socialist states. It's not a race we should have to run twice.
Nor should it be hard for someone like Mr. Hickenlooper to acknowledge as much - while also insisting on the distinction between unrestrained and regulated capitalism, market prices and moral values. One of the reasons why the right-wing charge of "socialism" against the Democratic Party rarely stuck was that it was generally untrue. To smooth the edges of capitalism, even to save it from itself, doesn't mean to disdain and disavow it.
There's a difference between taming a horse and shooting it.
Until about, oh, a year ago, few Democrats would have disagreed. Not anymore. Moderate Democrats are by no means an endangered species, but increasingly they act like a hunted one. Watching Mr. Hickenlooper, you could read his mind as if it were a chyron at the foot of the screen. Don't say "proud capitalist," John. Don't say it. Twitter will kill me if I do. Death by Twitter mob - or pre-emptive surrender to it - is how politics is largely conducted these days.
Is this good politics? I doubt it. As Geoffrey Kabaservice noted in the Guardian last November, "Nearly all of the Democrats who flipped the seats of moderate Republicans are themselves moderate. Few support the socialist agenda of Sen. Bernie Sanders." Progressive favorites like Andrew Gillum lost his race against a weak Republican opponent. And Joe Biden tops most Democratic primary polls by a wide margin.
It's also especially bad politics for someone like Mr. Hickenlooper, who can't get away with filibustering about the merits of capitalism if he hopes to get near the nomination. To the extent that Mr. Sanders' concept of democratic socialism has gained traction, it's not because capitalism has failed the masses. It's because Mr. Sanders, beyond any of his peers, has consistent convictions and an authentic persona.
To prevail, a moderate Democrat will need to behave likewise. The message can go like this: Capitalism has worked for millions of Americans. It worked for me. We need to reform it so it can work for everyone.
Is Mr. Hickenlooper the guy to do this? Doubtful. Then again, Donald Trump is gearing up to run a campaign based on a thriving economy (check), a country at peace (check), a mess of congressional investigations that will quickly confuse and bore the public (check), Democrats who want to turn Silicon Valley into a giant utility (check), an inconclusive Mueller report (likely check), and a Democratic Party that can neither bring itself to censure an anti-Semitic congresswoman nor publicly embrace the free-market system (check, check).
Democrats still seem to think 2020 is going to be a referendum on the president. It's not. It's going to be a choice. Right now, the Trump campaign could hardly ask for a bigger favor from its overconfident opponents.

Texto completo: For months, Juan Sanchez was at the center of the national uproar over family separations at the Mexican border because the nonprofit he founded, Southwest Key Programs, was housing migrant children taken from their parents. On Monday, facing intense scrutiny from his own organization and federal investigations over alleged financial improprieties, he stepped down after 32 years at the helm.
The charity's chief financial officer, Melody Chung, left last month after a New York Times article outlined allegations of mismanagement and possible malfeasance at the charity.
Southwest Key began an internal investigation after the article was published in December. The Justice Department also started investigating.
The Southwest Key shelter in a former Walmart superstore in Brownsville, Tex., known as Casa Padre, became a symbol of the Trump administration's family separation policy, with immigration advocates likening it to a warehouse for children. But it was also a generator of millions of dollars in federal grants at a nonprofit unusually concerned with its bottom line.
From its humble beginnings in Brownsville, the charity became the largest player in the shelter system for unaccompanied minors nationwide. In the last decade, Southwest Key was awarded almost $1.8 billion in federal money to care for those children. The nonprofit can house up to 5,000 children in its 24 shelters in Texas, Arizona and California, including the former Walmart.
Mr. Sanchez earned $1.5 million in 2017, the most recent tax return available. His wife earned $500,000. His daughter from a previous marriage also held a senior position, but her salary was not available. Ms. Chung earned $1 million.
But the modern-day Horatio Alger tale of a shoeshine boy and Golden Gloves boxer turned Harvard doctorate and nonprofit chief executive came to an end with Southwest Key's announcement of Mr. Sanchez's departure.
The Southwest Key board, in consultation with Mr. Sanchez, decided it was time to begin a new chapter at the charity, Orlando Martinez, the board chairman, said in a statement. "Our mission has never been more critical than it is today, and we must look carefully at what is required to evolve and grow as an organization," he said.
"This was a very difficult decision," Mr. Sanchez wrote in an email to employees that was obtained by The Times. "Recent events have convinced me and our Board of Directors that Southwest Key would benefit from a fresh perspective and new leadership. Widespread misunderstanding of our business and unfair criticism of our people have become a distraction our employees do not deserve, and I can no longer bear."
Mr. Sanchez's wife, Jennifer Nelson, remains as a top executive.
Mr. Sanchez's resignation came amid questions from The Times about Southwest Key's handling of charter schools spun off from the organization. Mr. Sanchez serves on the school board. It is unclear whether his resignation will change that.
As of February, there were more than 11,000 minors in the shelter system, housed in about 100 sites. As the number of unaccompanied migrant children continued to pose a crisis, Mr. Sanchez had been central to the administration's plans.
Southwest Key, which was sitting on $61 million in cash in the fall of 2017, also lent millions of dollars to real estate developers, acting more like a bank than a traditional charity. It has rented shelters rather than buying them, an unusual practice that has proved lucrative for shelter owners, including Mr. Sanchez and Ms. Chung, The Times reported in December.
Mr. Sanchez, Ms. Chung and a friend owned a shelter in Conroe, Tex., through a shell company. Asked by The Times last year about that potential self-dealing -- whereby the executives collected rent paid by the federal government -- they announced that they would seek to sell their ownership stakes. There is no record that the property has yet been sold.
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees migrant shelter grants, said late last year that the government had hired forensic accountants to review the finances of shelter operators, including Southwest Key.
Joella L. Brooks, a longtime Southwest Key employee and the current chief operating officer, was named interim chief executive. Mr. Sanchez said that a "nationwide search" would begin for a permanent replacement.
"I'm grateful for the opportunity to continue serving our dedicated employees and youth in need," Ms. Brooks, who joined the organization almost 30 years ago, said in a statement.
In 1987, Mr. Sanchez, who had grown up poor near the Mexican border, used his mother's address in Brownsville on founding documents for the nonprofit. The charity took out loans of $6,700 to buy a photocopier and a computer. Mr. Sanchez's salary at the time was a modest $35,000.
While its initial business was in juvenile justice, it was in the housing of unaccompanied migrant children that its revenues exploded. Ms. Chung noted in her resignation letter to staff that when she started working at Southwest Key 20 years ago, the nonprofit had roughly 500 employees and gross revenue of $16 million. By the time she resigned, those numbers had grown to 8,000 employees and gross revenue of more than $400 million.
Ms. Chung closed her resignation letter last month, "May the Lord continue to bless the company abundantly forever!"

For a growing number of Americans, socialism is OK

Texto completo: You wouldn’t expect democratic socialists to hit the brakes when it comes to social justice.
But in late February members of Inland Empire Democratic Socialists of America learned how to fix brake lights so they could offer that bit of auto repair service, for free, at an upcoming community event. Working tail lights, they reasoned, would mean fewer police traffic stops and, possibly, fewer fatal outcomes for people of color.
Auto repair is just one part of the chapter’s public outreach about an ideology that, increasingly, is finding a more receptive public audience. Polling shows more Americans, especially Democrats, view socialism more favorably than capitalism, even if they have sometimes wildly different ideas of what socialism is.
“It just doesn’t have the same stigma,” Kimberley Coles, a political anthropologist at the University of Redlands, said of the word “socialism.”
“It doesn’t mean there won’t be … rhetoric and seeing what sticks in terms of the insults.”
A Gallup poll from last summer found that for the first time in 10 years, Democrats had a more positive view of socialism (57 percent) than they did of capitalism (45 percent). That shift among Democrats drove down the overall view of capitalism.
“A majority of Americans have retained a positive view of capitalism over the past eight years, but this year’s 56% positive rating is by four points the lowest recorded since 2010,” Gallup reported. “Americans’ positive views of socialism have varied only between 35% and 39%, with (2018’s) reading of 37% right at the trend average.”
Gallup also found that among young people (ages 18 to 29) capitalism had slipped from 68 percent approval in 2010 to 45 percent approval last year.
Gallup isn’t the only pollster seeing that trend.
Thirty-one percent of Democrats in a YouGov poll from last August said they would be “comfortable” with a socialist presidential candidate, compared to just 8 percent for Republicans.
The same YouGov poll found 44 percent of Americans had a favorable view of capitalism, down from 52 percent in 2015. Americans age 18 through 29 are likelier to see the word “socialist” as a compliment while Americans age 65 and older are more likely to consider it an insult, although the 65-and-up group views socialism more favorably now (25 percent) than in 2015 (15 percent), according to YouGov.
Capitalism’s polling dip — and the corresponding rise in approval for the label “socialism” — coincides with ballot box gains by politicians who are connected with the political organization Democratic Socialists of America.
Running as Democrats, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib in 2018 became the first Democratic Socialists of America members to win congressional seats. Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected 2016 presidential campaign fueled an effort to turn the Democratic Party leftward, a trend that’s continued with Ocasio-Cortez’s celebrity status.
Nationally, Democratic Socialists of America had just 5,000 members prior to November 2016, but passed the 40,000-member mark following Ocasio-Cortez’s upset in New York’s June 2018 primary, according to published reports.
The organization’s Southern California connections include chapters in the Inland Empire, Orange County and Los Angeles. “Our chapter is continuing to grow and evolve from its humble roots,” the Inland chapter collectively wrote in response to emailed questions. “Fresh faces appear at every monthly member meeting.”
It’s not just about faces and personalities, either.
Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal for a Green New Deal, along with proposals from many candidates for universal health care, higher taxes on the rich and other socialist-favored ideas, figure to loom over the crowded race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
It’s also already become a rallying cry — perhaps even the central theme — of Republican election efforts.
During last month’s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump drew applause from supporters when he invoked socialism as a pejorative.
“We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said before declaring that “America will never be a socialist country.”
Fears of socialism “could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of (President Trump’s 2020) campaign that sounding the alarm about ‘criminal illegal aliens’ was in 2016,” The New York Times reported.
“Socialism is the greatest vulnerability by far that the House Democrats have,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, told the Times.
Socialism replaced Hillary Clinton as the main villain at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which featured a “bread line” mocking Ocasio-Cortez.
“They want to take away your hamburgers,” former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka warned conference-goers. “This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved.”
What is socialism?
Americans fight not only over whether socialism is good or bad, but over what it means. Seventeen percent defined socialism as “government ownership of the means of production,” that was about half the number of Americans who used that definition of socialism in 1949, Gallup reported last October.
“Americans today are most likely to define socialism as connoting equality for everyone, while others understand the term as meaning the provision of benefits and social services, a modified form of communism, or a conception of socialism as people being social and getting along with one another About a quarter of Americans were not able to give an answer.”
The Democratic Socialists of America is “a ‘big tent’ organization,” the Inland chapter said. “Members may embrace a variety of tactics, theoretical frameworks, and emphases, but ultimately work toward a classless society undergirded by an economy in which production and the fruits of production are shared by all.”
To fight what the chapter sees as misconceptions – socialism is “inherently totalitarian” or a “mere matter of welfare state programs,” for example – members stress that socialism is organized from the bottom-up, outside of government, and that socialism emphasizes freedom, including “the ability of working people to resist the private tyranny of the firm and its owners,” the chapter said.
Socialism made Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, not the other way around, the chapter said. “Their ideas were popular because the moment was right for a socialist alternative, after a major recession, stagnant wages, and widespread discontent with the status quo.
“Our chapter as a whole is sympathetic to Bernie/AOC, but we seek also to hold them accountable to their promises, and members may find that their views do not completely overlap with theirs. This being said, among elected officials, their reform agenda is the closest in spirit to our movement …”
Besides fixing brake lights, the Inland chapter, which estimates it has 30 to 40 active members, also stumps for Medicare-for-all at events like Riverside’s monthly Public Arts Walk. It also hosts movie screenings with discussions afterward – “Sorry to Bother You” was a recent feature – and members have traveled to Mexico to help migrants at the border.
“A new idea”
Coles and Harold Clarke, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, think socialism’s surging popularity, especially among millennials, is rooted in recent history.
“Socialism’s kind of a new idea for them and it’s detached from a lot of the economics and brutal politics of the past,” Clarke said.
Millennials “aren’t shaped by Cold War politics, much less attachment to political parties,” Coles said. “They’re interested in a la carte political ideas, rather than being labeled as Republicans or socialist.”
They also grew up during the Great Recession of the late 2000s, when capitalism’s flaws “were highlighted in political rhetoric,” Coles added. “Socialism has historically always offered a critique of capitalism and highlighted the inequality of economic and political power.”
The Trump backlash also might be a factor. “With his hotel empire, numerous side businesses, and history of shortchanging employees and contractors, current President Donald Trump perhaps encapsulates capitalism at its worst … ,” Eillie Anzilotti wrote in an article about the Gallup poll results for Fast Company magazine.
She added that Trump alone likely doesn’t explain the drop in capitalism’s popularity, especially among young people. “Since the 1970s, wages (adjusted for inflation) have barely risen, while (the) cost of living has skyrocketed across the U.S. Meanwhile, the top 1% of earners in America … has captured 85% of income growth that’s occurred since 2009.”
The uptick in socialism’s popularity could be a lasting trend, Coles said.
“I feel that these millennial voters are … more interested in learning from others (and are more) cosmopolitan in being willing to take ideas from lots of places,” she said. “It seems that people are interested in new ideas and socialism is offering one set of solutions.”

Texto completo: Priscilla Villarreal es una reportera sobre cuatro ruedas: hace lo que ella llama “noticias en movimiento” desde su “demonio azul” , la camioneta con la que recorre las calles de la fronteriza ciudad de Laredo, Texas . Su forma de hacer periodismo es novedosa ya que combina todas las posibilidades que brinda Facebook y, a la vez, cuenta en espanglish historias que pueden ser de utilidad para sus más de 120 000 seguidores (y sumando).
Hija de migrantes mexicanos, Lagordiloca , como se hace llamar en la red social, nació en Estados Unidos hace 34 años. Después de dejar la escuela a temprana edad, tuvo varios trabajos, el último de ellos en un desguace para el que recogía chatarra de tráileres inservibles. Desde 2015, su trabajo como reportera de exclusivas locales ha dado un giro a su vida ya que, según dijo al diario New York Times, le ha ayudado a superar los problemas de depresión y estrés postraumático que venía sufriendo tras la pérdida prematura de su bebé hace alrededor de diez años.
Con una forma desenfadada y directa de contar las noticias, Villarreal informa sobre accidentes de tráfico, redadas policiales o crímenes locales . También ha contadado en primicia temas relacionados con corruptelas en el seno de las autoridades policiales de su ciudad, que han supuesto incluso su detención en un debate sobre los límites de la libertad de expresión del que salió airosa .
Junto con la información, comparte también su opinión sobre el caso y envuelve todo en un ya característico tono de “chisme” . “Yo hablo el lenguaje de las calles y por eso la gente me sigue” – reconoció en una entrevista. En su página de Facebook también se ven artículos de otros medios y recomendaciones de sus lugares favoritos . La pequeña cantidad de ingresos que recibe de los restaurantes que frecuenta le permite continuar con su carrera como reportera.
Los videos en directo por Facebook son su canal estrella de comunicación. Los empieza con un recurrente “¡Qué rollo!” y, a través de ellos, revela las exclusivas, cuenta en pantalla lo que está sucediendo e, incluso, habla de su vida personal y responde al momento a los comentarios de sus seguidores . Por todo ello, no ha tardado en hacerse popular y ha cosechado un gran número de fans -que la paran por la calle para pedirle fotos y autógrafos- pero tambien algunos haters -que critican su aspecto físico o su forma de hacer comunicación.

Texto completo: In calling for a re-examination of the landmark case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas adopted an unduly generous view of the conduct of local and state governments regarding free press rights under the First Amendment.
The Supreme Court decided Sullivan in 1964, after a federal district court in Alabama found that a civil rights organization’s ad in the New York Times had damaged the reputation of an Alabama sheriff who was identified by implication in the ad.
Sullivan established a higher standard for public officials and public figures to prove defamation of character. They would have to prove actual malice on the part of the accused defamer, that the publication had acted with “reckless disregard for the truth.”
Thomas, in an opinion related to a case in which one of Bill Cosby’s sexual assault victims had sued him for defamation, said the Founders did not deal specifically with the status of public officials or public figures when crafting the First Amendment.
“The states are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm,” he wrote.
Well, they might be capable of it but there is abundant evidence that they did not do so prior to the Sullivan decision. Public officials in Southern states regularly used libel suits to stifle press coverage of the civil rights movement. At the time of Sullivan, suits seeking more than $300 million in damages were pending in Southern state courts over such coverage.
Thomas accused his predecessors of, basically, making up the decision as a matter of public policy rather than of constitutional law.
But Justice William Brennan, who wrote the Sullivan opinion, said the First Amendment’s press freedom guarantee represented the Founders’ “commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.”
It is extraordinarily naïve to believe that many public officials would attack the press for routine news coverage in the absence of Sullivan. President Donald Trump has said as much, including even satire such as that on “Saturday Night Live.”
Sullivan is not just constitutionally valid; it is more important than ever.

Ashton: That one time my sister shoved a jelly bean up my nose, and other things only sisters can relate to

Texto completo: In honor of National Siblings Day next month, I’m going to tell you about my sister, Erin.
One day, my sister shoved a hummingbird egg up my nose.
I was probably six years old, and she was nine. We were on a road trip to St. George. Hummingbird eggs were a type of jelly bean. They were small, and shaped like a disk.
This was around the time when she convinced me that lying on the floor of the back seat was so much better than sitting on an actual seat.
I was gullible. I’ll admit it.
This wasn’t the first time my sister had pulled the wool over my eyes. We routinely got ice cream at a place on 3300 South. She would say, “Let’s have a contest and see who can eat their ice cream the fastest!”
I would shove it into my mouth as fast as possible, so fast that it wasn’t even tasty anymore. And then I would win.
And with her full bowl of ice cream, she would say, “Congratulations. You win.” Then she would lick her spoon in an exaggerated manner, because she had so much ice cream, and I had none.
Just like Charlie Brown and Lucy with the football, I fell for it every time.
I should’ve known from the beginning how things were going to go. Apparently, upon hearing the news that my mother had given birth to me, she (as a toddler) went outside and peed on the porch. A most inauspicious beginning to sisterhood.
As a pre-teen, she would sing that song from Madness called “Our House.”
The lyrics were originally:
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our street…
But she would change the lyrics to:
My sister… in the middle of the street.
A car… came and ran over her feet.
She lay… splattered all over the street.
She got… amputation of the feet.
One time, after she’d recently returned from a church mission, she gave one of my favorite shirts to one of her friends. When I complained, she said, “I guess you don’t know what it’s like to be Christlike and charitable.”
I said, “How does giving away my clothes somehow make you charitable?”
Still, as sisters go, I could’ve had it much worse. After all, Cleopatra’s sister, Arsinoe, was seen as a threat. So Cleopatra had her poisoned, as sisters tend to do when they feel threatened. (Did you know there’s a word for this? It’s “sororicide.”)
That left Cleopatra alone to rule Egypt and then get bitten by an asp.
My sister never went as far as to poison me. At least, I don’t think she did. Maybe I can only take her at her word.
No, her modus operandi involved getting bored on a road trip, and shoving a hummingbird egg up her sister’s nose.
I tried to get the thing out, with details that I will leave to the imagination. But the darn jelly bean was stuck.
My mom started to get suspicious.
“Girls, what’s going on back there?”
My sister gave me a tissue. “Shhhh. Don’t tell mom. Now blow! Like your brain depends on it!”
We got it out, and my mom was none the wiser until some time later. But you’d think that would be a rule that didn’t require mentioning: Don’t shove things up your sister’s nose.
Even so, I didn’t want her to get in trouble. Because everyone knows the first rule of sisterhood is I can mess with my sister, but if you mess with her, the gloves come off.
So, here’s to Erin. Sisters by chance. And now friends by choice. Despite a history of nasal jelly beans.

Public has a right to see the Mueller report

Texto completo: In 1970, Daniel Ellsberg was a 40-year-old Ph.D. and ex-Marine who had worked for months with the Defense Department to compile a 47-volume, 7,000-page study of the divisive war in Vietnam. But when the report was done – damning America's deception and outright lies to the public – the government decided to deep-six the study, hide it away, and only share it with a privileged few authorities.
Ellsberg believed the study the government had done on how America slowly slipped into the mire of Vietnam – replete with classified documents -- was vital to insuring that another 58,220 Americans would not die again in a future war.
Furious, Ellsberg spent countless hours copying the voluminous report and then leaked it to the New York Times and the Washington Post. The infamous Pentagon Papers spilled over into the front pages of America. Ellsberg's leak became one of the key turning points in the change of public opinion against the war. "I think that if the information had been put out, Congress would not have gone along with that war as they did," Ellsberg said years later.
And now we have approached another Ellsberg moment.
Special counsel Robert Mueller has been investigating the president of the United States and his team to see if there was pre-election cooperation or alliance with a foreign power, namely the Russians. And certainly a lot of smoke has been found and revealed, and a lot of people have been charged with crimes.
Mueller is rumored to be completing his work, looking at whether the last presidential election was illegitimate, influenced by hostile powers or, worst of all, if candidate Trump made promises to the Russians for help in winning the election. We just don't know those answers right now, but Mueller's report will indeed help citizens make an important decision: Is this an impeachment moment?
And yet, unbelievably, we might not see the report. As the special counsel law was written, Mueller must turn over his findings to the new attorney general who will then decide what, if anything, to give to Congress. He is not obligated to make the findings public, which is an outrage in itself.
I turned to the man who for 43 years has safeguarded New York state's open meetings and documents laws, Robert J. Freeman, executive director of the Committee on Open Government. He has written thousands of opinions on the question of what should be public.
"The only element that should be withheld with justification is disclosure of national security," he argued. After months of a cloud hanging over this government, Freeman says, "the attorney general should disclose to clear the air." Freeman added: "Shine the light and good things begin to happen or bad things stop."
It's all pretty simple actually. The people are the governors. They tell their elected representatives what to do and the more we know of their behavior, the more we can judge and hold them accountable. If there is no collusion, as the President has repeated ad nauseam, then he has nothing to fear from the Mueller report. Others might — 34 people and three companies have already plead guilty — but he shouldn't.
If he wants the so-called "witch hunt" to end, then simply release the report and be done with it. But it will get complicated — and political.
The AG will get the report, comb it to see if any national security, secret sources or confidential methods are revealed. Those he could redact, or blackout. Then there is this matter: what if people who have not committed crimes are besmirched in the report? Should their behavior be revealed? In grand juries, which are secret, if a person is not charged, the name is not revealed.
That argument is "feeble," says Freeman. This is not a grand jury. "The Russia issue has gotten national and international attention. The public has the right to know what the government is up to. People can find out who is sleeping, who is smart, who deserves reelection." And who is a traitor or corrupt.
The fear, of course, is that behind the scenes the President will pressure the AG to take out blemishes on the pretense that no crime was committed. As for censoring something that's merely damaging: "Embarrassment is not one of the grounds for withholding," Freeman says. "If it were, little would be left of the law."
That might suit the President and his Republican backers who could vote to block release. In the last impeachment battle, after a four-year investigation of Bill Clinton, the Special Counsel delivered a 445-page report; the House voted 363–63 to release. And 20 million people went online to see its salacious detail on oral sex in the Oval Office. The government's computers crashed.
And the Mueller Report is no different. The public wants to see it, needs to see it and has a right to see it.
So back to Daniel Ellsberg. If the AG and Congress decide not to release a report that the public has been clamoring for, will a new Ellsberg emerge? A leaker who will conclude what Ellsberg eventually did: "I needed to put out information that the public needed to know, and it just hadn't happened."
Freeman brought up to me the potential for a leak of the report. "The difference between good and aggressive reporters and not so good reporters involves the ability to take advantage of one of the rules of human nature," he said. The rule? "There's someone on nearly every board who's willing to spill the beans."
We shouldn't need a leaker. But authoritarians who head governments, even in democracies, always think they know what's best for us to know, instead of saying: citizens should know all and then they can decide and self govern. Why not release? What are you protecting? Who are you protecting?
"Without full disclosure, as a society, we'll continue to mistrust and maintain the divide that exists now," Freeman says. If the attorney general is to maintain credibility, "I think he has to clear the air and disclose the whole thing."
Please pardon the cliché, but even clichés have their time. Publicity is the soul of justice. Let that sun shine in. Democracy demands it -- as should the people.

Texto completo: As you grumble about your lost hour of sleep this weekend, just remember: Don't blame Benjamin Franklin. Despite legend, the nerdiest founding father did not invent daylight saving time. (He suggested cities wake residents earlier on summer mornings by the sound of cannon fire, so perhaps it's best he didn't get his way.)
No, the reason you may need an extra cup of coffee Sunday is because of World War I. And golf.
Changing clocks in the summer was first proposed around the turn of the 20th century by two guys who came up with it separately, though for the same reason. New Zealander George Hudson and Englishman William Willett both wanted more time after work in the summer for their sunlight-required pastimes - in Willett's case, hitting the links, and in Hudson's, collecting bugs. And really, why let time itself keep you from your hobbies?
Neither men's proposals gained much traction, however, until the outbreak of the World War I. The Germans were the first to do it, on April 30, 1916, as a way to save on coal-powered lighting in factories. British politicians moved to follow suit two days later and had set their clocks forward by the end of May. Most other European countries weren't far behind.
Time was a little slower to change in the United States, which did not join the war until 1917. Stockbrokers and manufacturers made a flurry of patriotic posters in support of daylight saving. But railroad companies, afraid confusion around the time change could cause a deadly crash, were adamantly against it. So were farmers, who worked by the sun anyway and did not want interactions with the clock-keeping world to get screwy.
"If you're a farmer, you can't just go work an hour early, because you need the sunlight to see what you're doing, especially in those days," says David Prerau, author of "Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time." This was especially hard on dairy farmers, who would have to start milking cows in the dark to meet train schedules for delivery.
"Plus, the sun, beside giving light, it gives heat, and it drives off the dew on a lot of the things that have to be harvested. And you can't harvest things when they're wet," Prerau says.
The stockbrokers won; a bill passed Congress and President Woodrow Wilson signed it. But the first nationwide time change suffered from some seriously unfortunate scheduling. It was March 31, 1918 - Easter Sunday. Newspapers published instructions on how and when to set clocks forward, and churches posted signs out front warning parishioners.
The Chicago Tribune called it "a lie that will benefit you and your country," which is a pretty weird way to put it.
At 2 a.m., a reception at Madison Square Garden marked the occasion, and in the U.S. Capitol, a few senators stayed awake with the Sergeant-at-Arms to reset the Ohio Clock.
The next day, things went surprisingly smoothly. "Some churchgoers were an hour late, but no baseball games were called on account of darkness," reported The New York Times. "Those looking to the sky at nightfall expecting to see a miracle were disappointed."
By the next year, the war had ended, and many thought daylight saving time should end with it, Prerau says. Lawmakers representing farmers introduced nearly two dozen bills to repeal it; one Mississippi congressman urged, "Repeal the law and have the clocks proclaim God's time and tell the truth!" A New Jersey congressman who supported it told people to think of the veterans coming home from the war, "Are they not deserving of the extra hour of recreation?"
A repeal sailed through the House, cleared the Senate and landed on Wilson's desk. He vetoed it, saying it could cause an economic downturn.
A vote to override the president's veto failed, but haters were unbowed. They passed another repeal bill, which the president vetoed again. But this time, they were better prepared, getting the two-thirds majority in the House and Senate needed to override the president. (All of this happened in a month; Congress used to be productive!) Daylight saving time was dead.
So if they got rid of it, then why are you late to brunch now?
Cities like New York and Pittsburgh passed their own daylight saving time laws, and it was brought back nationally for a little while during World War II. As The Post's Michael S. Rosenwald has written, all the time laws among cities and states got so messed up that in Iowa, there were 23 different daylight saving dates, depending on what town you were in. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson finally smoothed it out, making daylight saving time the law of the land.

Texto completo: The rise of the Manhasset boys basketball team has been one of the feel-good stories on Long Island this season. Having improved from 9-10 a year ago to 19-3, and having won only their second Nassau title in 22 years, the Indians - led by 73-year-old coach George Bruns - will face Wyandanch on Sunday night at NYCB Live's Nassau Coliseum in the Long Island/ Southeast Regional Class A championship game.
For Bruns, walking into Long Island's basketball cathedral will be filled with nostalgia and memories. It will be the first time he's been in the building for a basketball event in more than 45 years.
The Coliseum, you see, was home for the most exciting time in his basketball life: when he played for the 1972-73 New York Nets of the ABA, coached by Lou Carnesecca.
"Things happen in funny ways, but I expect that it will jog a lot of great memories for me," Bruns said during an interview at the Floral Park home he and his wife, Elene, have shared since 1970. "I wasn't there long but, for my time in basketball, it was great times."
What has paved Bruns' road back to the Coliseum is a scrappy team of overachievers who dedicated themselves to making the most of this season in the wake of last season's disappointment. The Indians competed together in summer leagues at Hofstra, in Hicksville and in Hempstead and bought into Bruns' vision for what it would take to be winners.
"They are one of those teams where the whole is greater than the sum of their parts," he said. "I am proud of them, but they should be proud of themselves .  .  . They find a way to win on the day they play."
Long road to Coliseum
It was a much more circuitous route to the Coliseum the first time. Bruns was the late-blooming, fundamentally sound point guard at the since-repurposed St. Augustine Diocesan High School in his native Brooklyn. He was a walk-on at Manhattan College and ultimately improved into a starter who would, as a senior, make the 1966 all-Metropolitan team.
But when college ended in 1966, it looked as if his shot at continuing high-level basketball did, too. He tried out for the Eastern Professional Basketball Association (now called the CBA), which played mostly on weekends, and was cut. For Bruns, basketball became pickup games and amateur leagues in and around New York and Long Island.
He took high school teaching jobs in New York's five boroughs and soon became the boys basketball coach at McClancy High in Queens.
"I was playing in the Long Island Press League and there was an official who worked in the Eastern League and encouraged me to try out again," Bruns said. "I did and made the team in Hartford [for 1969-70], the Hartford Bics. I think maybe that's where people saw I had a pretty good basketball IQ. I could run a team, saw the mismatches, knew who hadn't touched the ball in a while, kept everybody happy."
He played that season in Hartford and the next three for the Allentown Jets, all the while commuting from Long Island and McClancy.
Before the 1972-73 season, former St. John's player Lou Roethel convinced him to try out for the Nets. He played well but was cut and returned to playing weekends with Allentown.
And then his break came: The Nets suffered a spate of backcourt injuries.
Nets assistant John Kresse - who played at St. John's, was on Carnesecca's coaching staff there and with the Nets and became nationally known as the College of Charleston coach - wanted to scout him.
"I had called George at home," Kresse told The New York Times in 1973, "and asked for directions to drive to Allentown. I told him I was going to look over some talent, never mentioning that he was the one we were looking for. He played a great game, took 12 shots, hit on seven and ran the ballclub."
Carnesecca called days later to offer a three-game contract. "They'd just moved to the Coliseum and I wasn't sure what to do," Bruns said. "[A friend] advised me, 'Sign that contract, because it'll never happen again.'  "
Bruns played only six minutes that first game, but in the next one, he scored 15 points in 30 minutes as the Nets upset a mighty Kentucky Colonels squad led by future Hall of Famers Artis Gilmore and Dan Issel.
Not only did he feel comfortable playing at that level, but he was surrounded by talented players who could finish on his passes. And the Nets signed him for the remainder of the season.
"What I like most is that George knows what's happening at all times," Carnesecca told the Daily News that season. "He can salvage a situation without being told what to do."
And soon he became a fan favorite, the everyman who could compete with the pros.
"We had kids ringing the bell of the house and asking for autographs," Bruns said. "And even though our team had players like Whopper [Billy Paultz] and Bill Melchionni and John Roche, so many people wanted me to sign autographs after the games .  .  . It was really a great time."
Bruns averaged 6.6 points and 2.8 assists in 18.2 minutes in the final 13 games and was looking forward to playing for the Nets the following season - but it didn't happen. There was a new coaching staff, a new star in Julius Erving and a new sensation of a guard named "Super" John Williamson. It was a team that would win the ABA title.
A calling for coaching
Soon coaching became Bruns' forte. Over the next 30-odd years, he coached high school boys, then his daughters' CYO teams, then spent nine years as the women's coach at Nassau CC. He'd been out of coaching a short time when the Manhasset position opened up. Close confidant Stu Goldman encouraged him to go for the gig by promising to be an assistant coach, which he remains today.
"This has been a very satisfying season so far," Bruns said. "It can be a little scary because we never know which of the players is going to be the one to step up on any given night, but it just happens about every game .  .  . I can't wait to see what happ

Texto completo: By NASA's estimate, 530 million people watched Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon in July 1969, making it one of the most widely seen television events in history. Now a new film allows moviegoers to experience the Apollo 11 mission from unexpected angles through mesmerizing footage and recordings that were never intended for a large viewership -- or even necessarily for the public.
Constructed almost entirely from archival sources, the documentary "Apollo 11," which opened on Imax screens on March 1 and will expand to regular theaters on March 8, condenses nine days of the moon mission into roughly 90 minutes, beginning with preparations for the launch and ending with the astronauts' safe return. It interweaves a variety of perspectives, including those of the space travelers, of mission control, of onlookers anticipating the liftoff and of naval officers awaiting the capsule's splashdown.
The result is a film that drew spectacular reviews at its Sundance premiere. In The Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang called it "a stirring companion piece to Damien Chazelle's recent 'First Man."' Reviewing it on Friday for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny called it "entirely awe-inspiring."
[Read our review, a critic's pick.]
For the documentarian Todd Douglas Miller ("Dinosaur 13"), using original materials without voice-over or interviews seemed like a natural approach. In the audio recordings, public affairs officers explaining the mission to viewers at home "just sounded like narrators," Miller said.
Drawing on written documentation for clues, Miller and his team pieced together a variety of materials: 16-millimeter and 35-millimeter films that have long been available in some form; a treasure trove of 177 rediscovered 65-millimeter Panavision reels found at the National Archives and Records Administration; and audio recordings from mission control and other technical outposts.
With help from Stephen Slater, a TV documentarian and space buff in Britain who became the movie's archive producer and who, as a passion project, synced audio with footage from Apollo 11's descent, the filmmakers assembled those components into a remarkably fluid whole. Image and sound were fitted together like a puzzle. At points, onscreen text links the footage before our eyes with facts such as Apollo 11's precise velocity, distance from Earth and fuel level.
The sequences filmed in space -- which earned Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins honorary memberships in the American Society of Cinematographers -- have been seen before. Some of the most stunning images in the movie, like a shot from the lunar module as it descends toward the surface of the moon, can be found in degraded clips on YouTube (though they look far better restored here).
What has gone largely unseen until "Apollo 11" is the material shot on the ground, much of which was filmed in 65-millimeter Panavision, a high-quality format that would have been familiar to 1969 moviegoers from, well, "2001: A Space Odyssey." Whether the camera is racing by technical consoles or engaging in Frederick Wiseman-style people-watching of bystanders gathered to witness the launch, it produces imagery that has a startling vividness.
This footage remained buried until now because of financial, technical and institutional limitations. Daniel Rooney, a supervisory archivist at the National Archives who made the discovery of 177 reels, noted that NASA had photographic and film operations at sites across the country. NASA's movies of the Apollo missions eventually made their way to the National Archives.
But while NASA had "a very meticulous process" for collecting and cataloging footage from all those centers, Rooney said, "for some reason that never happened with these particular reels." Those reasons aren't necessarily mysterious. These were original color negatives, he said, and it would be difficult to know what was on them without processing the film, which was and is expensive. When Rooney investigated a future for the archives' 65- and 70-millimeter holdings in the late 2000s, processing of those formats had been declining in use for years.
And so it happened that Rooney, digging for film in 2017 after speaking with Miller, stumbled across the Panavision negatives that concerned the Apollo program. More than half the reels involved the preparation, launch and recovery of Apollo 11. "Those are sort of the big key areas," Rooney said.
Though some of the film was shot by NASA itself, much of it was made for a movie called "Moonwalk One," a strange combination of educational documentary and blissed-out philosophizing that opened in New York at the Whitney Museum in 1972.
Filmmaking and photography were integral to space exploration from the moment NASA started launching rockets, said Todd Gustavson, curator of the technology collection at the George Eastman Museum. John Glenn was the first astronaut to carry a camera on a mission, said Bill Barry, NASA's chief historian; Glenn had bought the camera in a Florida store and adapted it so he could wield it in a spacesuit for his 1962 Mercury voyage. In 1966 and 1967, special cameras that Kodak had designed for NASA mapped the surface of the moon, ensuring that Armstrong and company would know a safe spot to land.
Miller discovered from watching the launches of Apollo 8, 9 and 10 that the camera operators had flubbed a move they needed. "Everything was a dress rehearsal for 11," he said. "When 11 came, they just nailed every single shot."
His documentary draws on some footage that was captured specifically for engineering purposes. Extreme close-ups of the launch were filmed on a special 70-millimeter format, which made digitally scanning them even more complicated.
And almost all of the footage Miller's team had was silent. Luckily, specialized tape recorders in Houston captured key voices from those nine days. "NASA keeps records of everything," said Gregory H. Wiseman, an audio engineer at Johnson Space Center in Houston. "On any given day, this audio that's recorded is not significant, but if there's any sort of anomaly in space, then they will go back and review all of these different conversations." This would have been useful, he noted, with Apollo 13 and the Challenger and Columbia disasters.
The filmmakers also had crucial help from Ben Feist, who works part-time at an advertising agency in Toronto and also does research for NASA. (His sister is the singer-songwriter Feist.) In what began as a hobby, he took 11,000 hours of digitized recordings from Apollo 11, improved the audio quality and mapped them by minute and second. Using his programming, the filmmakers could listen to technicians' voices separately or in concert at any moment of the mission.
Although NASA approved the release of all the audio, and those heard speaking were government employees, the approach did raise ethical questions. "There are private phone conversations and things like that that occurred, between husband and wife or boyfriend and girlfriend," Feist said. "I haven't come across anything untoward," he added, though there is a discussion of booze quantities at splashdown parties. In one of the most striking moments in the movie, technicians are overheard discussing the fatal accident on Chappaquiddick Island, Mass., involving a car driven by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, which was in the news at the time.
Feist plans to post all 11,000 hours of audio on apolloinrealtime.org before the mission's July anniversary, allowing armchair historians to hear audio as if they were sitting in any seat at mission control. They could come across "something that, possibly, they're the first person to hear it in 50 years," he said.
Miller was focused on keeping the re-creation as to-the-minute as possible. "We did have kind of our own mission rules," he explained. "We said, if it didn't happen on that day at that specific time, we're not using it."
But he occasionally broke from that purist approach. To show a solar corona phenomenon that the astronauts speak of, Miller said, he used a shot from Apollo 12. During the moments showing the translunar injection maneuver -- the propulsive push that sent Apollo 11 toward the moon -- Miller used a shot from Apollo 8. He hopes to document these liberties and other aspects of the filmmaking process in a production journal.
The filmmakers are still hunting down names of camera operators, and the digital scans used for the movie will be made publicly available at the National Archives.
"I don't think it ever will end with Apollo," Slater said. "I can't really see how you could improve on this, but in 10 years maybe there will be another film with more uncovered footage. That would be great, wouldn't it?"

Texto completo: There are still persuadable voters in the network's audience, says GOP political strategist
There is no question that the top priority of Democrats in 2020 is to defeat President Trump on Election Day. It's not like they've been shy about their desire. In fact, according to a recent Monmouth University poll, 56 percent of Democrats believe that the most important quality in a presidential nominee is not a stance on any particular issue but whether he or she can win.
So it is perplexing that the Democratic National Committee has not adopted this attitude as it plans the presidential primary debates. On Wednesday, the DNC announced that it would not permit Fox News to host any of the debates. Chairman Tom Perez cited Jane Mayer's recent New Yorker article about Fox News and its "propagandistic" relationship with the Trump White House, holding it up as proof that Fox would treat Democrats unfairly. Rank-and-file party members across social media cheered the decision.
Their schadenfreude may be self-defeating. Fox News isn't just capable of hosting a fair and informative debate. It's also a crucial outlet for reaching an audience that contains some potential voters Democrats will need if they want to end Trump's presidency.
One common misconception about Fox News is that it's filled with wall-to-wall programming and personalities boosting Trump and his every utterance - a frequent charge of the network's critics. True, some hosts, such as Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, support the president and do not hide it. But these are the proprietors of opinion programs, and they are no different from opinion columnists like The Washington Post's Paul Waldman and the New York Times' Charles Blow, or MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Rachel Maddow. On the news side at Fox, several anchors refuse to toe the Trump line and remain devoted to solid reporting of stories and discussion of issues. (Full disclosure: I am an occasional guest on news and opinion shows on Fox News and Fox Business. I am not compensated for these appearances.)
There is an immediate, highly relevant historical example here: the third and final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in October 2016. Fox News's Chris Wallace hosted it, and figures from the left and the right cheered his work. The New Yorker's television critic, Emily Nussbaum, tweeted: "Gotta say, Chris Wallace is a pro. Cool demeanor, asking clear follow-ups," while the Times wrote that Wallace "mixed humor with scolding and persistence with patience to guide his charges toward the most substantive encounter of an unusually vicious election."
Lower-profile and lower-stakes coverage follows basic journalistic principles, too. Harris Faulkner earned praise from Slate, a frequent Fox News antagonist, for a segment discussing gun policy that she moderated in 2017 (note: I was one of the participants). Anchors Shepard Smith, Neil Cavuto, Dana Perino, Martha MacCallum, Bret Baier and others have also repeatedly received plaudits for their devotion to presenting the truth. Does the DNC think they have suddenly abandoned those values? (Mayer's piece alleged that a Fox News reporter was told to kill a story about Trump's affair with Stormy Daniels. Even if true, the executives who made the decision are no longer with Fox News.)
Further, since the 2016 election, Democrats have openly discussed their desire to win over Trump voters - many of whom are Fox News viewers. According to Nielsen, the network's viewers are 94 percent white and have a median age of 65: exactly the demographic in which Democrats will need to make headway in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio.
These voters aren't a transparently lost cause. Just over four months ago, there was a noticeable change in how white Americans voted. White voters backed Trump by a margin of 21 points in 2016 but preferred Republicans by just 10 points in 2018, according to the Pew Research Center. At the same time, voters 65 and older also saw a seismic shift that benefited Democrats, as these voters went from favoring Republicans by 16 percentage points in 2014 to preferring them by just two points in 2018. These Americans are clearly persuadable if they hear the right message. They may not leap onto Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's bandwagon, but the populism of Elizabeth Warren or the pragmatism of John Hickenlooper might appeal to some of them - maybe just enough of them.
Perez and the DNC have shut the door on a golden opportunity to talk directly to an audience of potential voters whom they have said they want to win over - voters who already trust the likely debate moderators from Fox News's stable of qualified anchors. The decision may elicit a smile from Democrats now, but it might not on the morning of Nov. 4, 2020, if they're asking themselves, as they did last time, whether they could have done more.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, voted against a sweeping campaign finance reform bill Friday, citing her opposition to a portion that would use public funds to multiply small campaign donations.
H.R. 1, the first legislative package introduced under the newly Democratic House of Representatives, is a three-pronged election overhaul — it addresses voter access, campaign finance and transparency.
It passed the House 234-193, though it's expected to die in the Republican-controlled Senate.
The bill would provide a voluntary six-to-one public match to candidates for small donations up to $200. For instance, a candidate who received a $50 donation from a constituent could then receive $300 in matching public funds. Supports say it would elevate the impact of small donations from individuals in comparison to large donations from corporations and Political Action Committees.
Under H.R. 1, public funding for elections would come from a new 2.75 percent fee on fines or settlements with businesses that commit corporate malfeasance.
In a media release, Herrera Beutler expressed opposition to using public money to finance political campaigns.
“Who on earth thinks we don't have enough money in politics? Nobody, yet House Democrats are pushing H.R. 1, a bill that would explode the amount of money spent on campaigns. And worse yet, they'd do so with public dollars,” she said.
“When I ask people about how government should best spend the public's money, some say they want more to go to schools. Some say our military. Some say research for curing diseases. Never once, in my entire life, have I had someone say to me ‘I'd like the government to send money to political consultants to pay for more TV campaign ads.' But that's exactly what this bill does.
“Under this bill, every time someone writes a campaign a $100 check, the federal government follows it up with another $600 contribution to go toward that candidate. Maybe you would personally never support Bernie Sanders, or Donald Trump, or me. But you don't have a choice under this bill. That's un-American.”
H.R. 1 also would require presidential and vice presidential candidates to disclose a decade worth of personal tax information and give the Office of Government Ethics more oversight and enforcement power.
It would also make Election Day a holiday for all federal employees, encourage private businesses to do the same and attempt to expand voter participation by making a national register of voters that automatically “opts-in” all eligible citizens.
In the media release, Herrera Beutler also said she was worried about how such a register might compromise election security.
“We're considering a bill that would weaken the integrity of the voter rolls in many cases by severely limiting the ability of officials to remove ineligible voters from the rolls and making it much more difficult to verify the accuracy of voter information,” she said.
“Why would we make it harder to prevent ballots from deceased individuals, or illegal immigrants, or people illegally registered multiple times from being cast in our elections? And the federal commission in charge of regulating elections would be restructured in a way that would make it all too easy to turn it into a partisan tool, rather than a neutral watchdog.”
Multiple studies over decades have shown that fraudulent ballots and voting by illegal immigrants is a relative nonissue. Following President Trump's claims of voter fraud in the 2016 election, a nationwide survey of election and law enforcement by The New York Times found two possible cases of an illegal immigrant voting out of 137.7 million voters. A similar survey from The Washington Post found possibly four cases of voter fraud, none of which were linked to noncitizens.

As podcasts go corporate, smaller voices fear being drowned out

Texto completo: A wave of consolidation in the podcasting industry carries big stakes for the Boston area, whose robust public media scene and active community of independent producers have made the region a crucial center of growth for the burgeoning field.
New money is flowing rapidly into podcasting, most notably Spotify's recent acquisition of the hot Brooklyn startup Gimlet Media. That trend could shift the balance of power in an industry whose collaborative ethos has allowed small players to flourish alongside larger ones.
Many in Boston's podcasting scene are taking the rising corporate interest as a good sign, one that could point toward new ways of making a living through audio production. But there's also a fear that a rush for profits in the industry could eventually squeeze out all but the biggest stars.
“It proves the value of the industry," said Kerri Hoffman, chief executive of PRX, the Cambridge-based public media giant that distributes shows including “This American Life." But Hoffman said it's vital that companies jumping into podcasting help new voices find their audiences.
“The openness of both radio and on-demand audio is something we invest a lot of time and energy in," she said. “That's how you get diverse voices. That's how you get niche programming. It's media in the public interest."
Lastmonth, Spotify, the Swedish music streaming giant, spent $340 million to buy Anchor, which helps podcasters make and distribute their shows, and Gimlet, whose podcasts include “Conviction", “StartUp," and “Reply All."
And this week, a podcast startup called Luminary said that it had raised nearly $100 million to support a subscription-based podcast network including shows from millennial favorites Lena Dunham, creator of HBO's “Girls," and comedian Hannibal Buress.
Such moves could spur other big tech companies to step up their investments in either podcast content or technology. For instance, Apple, which provides the dominant platform for free podcast subscriptions, has not looked to the medium as a significant money-making opportunity — yet.
Galen Beebe, an editor working on the podcast “Ministry of Ideas" and with the local group Bello Collective, said that though producers need some skills to record and distribute a show, audio lends itself to openness in a way that other media do not.
“The barrier to entry is a lot lower than it is for writing, because we all talk all the time. And we're all really used to connecting with each other through our voices," Beebe said. “In that way it is really easy for anyone to connect or anyone to listen, and at the moment there are a lot of free ways to do that."
The most popular podcast applications use open standards that allow anyone to distribute a show through a few technical steps. But there's no guarantee that the platforms of the future will have the same qualities.
Some worry the applications could eventually control who gets to list their shows in the places where listeners are most likely to look. And some are concerned that podcasts could be increasingly hidden behind paywalls, where it might be harder for casual listeners to find shows that don't have huge audiences.
Wade Roush, host and producer of the tech and culture podcast “Soonish" and cofounder of the Boston podcasting collective Hub & Spoke, said he hopes consumers will continue to have easy access to podcasts from a diversity of producers.
“Netflix is great, but thank God we also have Showtime, and AMC, and HBO, and the TV networks, because no one should have a lock on creativity," he said. “It would be horrifying if one single company became the arbiter of all podcasting."
Public media powerhouses have raised the bar on production values, seeding the podcast world with slick, popular shows including WBUR's “Modern Love" project with The New York Times.
But groups such as PRX have also worked to keep the medium open and accessible to less sophisticated producers, both as a way to develop a feeder system for high-quality programming and because the medium works for public radio's financial structure.
Bob Kempf, vice president for digital services at WGBH, is optimistic about the organization's business model for sustaining free podcasts, whose combination of advertising sponsorships and appeals for listener support has translated well into the digital realm.
Nonprofit media in Massachusetts, have been working to ensure the future of podcasts includes smaller shows and less experienced producers.
PRX runs a Podcast Garage in Allston, for instance, an effort to lower the barriers to entry by allowing producers to record shows on high-quality equipment for a small fee.
In the space set back from Western Avenue on a recent afternoon, Maureen Dahill and Heather Foley recorded an episode of their talk-show format podcast “Caught Up," an extension of their voicey online neighborhood magazine Caught In Southie.
The show, which can rack up a 1,500 downloads on a good week, has been a big help in growing their business, and might not have worked without the Podcast Garage.
“We are very amateur as far as experience goes, but we sound like pros," Foley said.
RadioPublic, a Boston tech startup with close links to public media, makes technology intended to keep producers big and small in control of their products.
The company's podcast listening app helps listeners to find shows they might not discover on other platforms. Its Paid Listens service handles ad sales for small producers, collecting advertisers, distributing ads to listeners, and providing the producer with a cut of the proceeds. Another new offering helps producers with the complex task of setting up a website and feed to host episodes in a way that listeners can find them.
Nicholas Quah, the Connecticut-based publisher of the trade publication Hot Pod, said Boston's podcasting sector could be a bulwark against the centralization of the industry.
“They could very well create a system of distribution, marketing, and content development that could be a check on whatever Spotify brings to the table two to three years down the line," Quah said.
But the question, he said, remains: “Does everybody win, or do a small number of publishers win, and who gets power in the situation?"

Deportation, Long Delayed, Becomes a Painful Ritual

Texto completo: DENVER -- Just hours stood between Jorge Zaldivar and his meeting with immigration officials, and so once again his family gathered to say goodbye.
Nearly a million people in the United States have received deportation orders but have managed to stay in the country anyway, often hanging on through postponements granted to them at check-ins with immigration officials. For years, those appointments were largely routine, and most people went in expecting to receive another temporary reprieve.
That changed when the Trump administration said it would expand deportation priorities to include anyone who had crossed the border illegally. And in the last two years, in households across the country, the dinner before a check-in has turned into a grim ritual, with families never sure whether or not this meal is the last they share together.
[Read about a mother and daughter who were seeking asylum -- they both have H.I.V. but only one was allowed entry .]
The Zaldivar children -- Francysco, 8, Aanahny, 10, Dyego, 14, Yolanda, 20, and Josefyna, 23 -- all United States citizens, have lived in a cycle of check-ins and court dates for most of their lives. Their father crossed into the country illegally in 1997 and has been trying to gain legal residency through his wife, Christina, also a citizen, for more than a decade.
That has failed, and the Zaldivars said goodbye to their father on June 7, 2017, on July 5, 2017, and on Jan. 10, 2018, and then four more times last year. In late February, The New York Times followed them on the night before Mr. Zaldivar's latest immigration appointment.
Ms. Zaldivar, 39, who is of Navajo and Southern Ute descent, never expected to be in this position. She married her husband in 2005, when she was a single mother of three. At the time, it did not occur to her to think much about his immigration status.
"You don't fall in love and say: 'Hi, nice to meet you, do you have papers?"' she said. "I didn't care if he had papers or not. He treated me right after an abusive marriage."
Mostly, she said, she experiences guilt and anger over what all this has done to her children. Her oldest daughter skipped college to help pay her father's legal fees. Her middle son has started lashing out at teachers, unable to explain to them what is happening at home.
At dinner, the house filled with relatives.
When everyone had a plate of chicken and rice, Ms. Zaldivar called for silence.
She had received an email earlier that day from a congressional aide helping with their case. The aide had heard from immigration officials.
"Dad's stay was denied," Ms. Zaldivar said, looking at her children. "Tomorrow when he goes in to check in, they're not going to let him come out."
In the morning, at the breakfast table, Ms. Zaldivar hauled out a blue tote she had prepared for her husband, with a list of medications and hotel-size toiletries, meant to help him if or when he arrived in Mexico.
Mr. Zaldivar took out his wallet and removed his driver's license, his worker's permit and a piece of paper bearing his social security number.
He handed them to his wife for safekeeping, and slipped $100 into the billfold.
Then he went into his youngest daughter's room, where he began to clean, packing her toys into the dollhouse, organizing the stacks of Girl Scout cookies.
"I'm stressed," he said. "I want to this to be over."
"Let's go," Ms. Zaldivar called.
Mr. Zaldivar took the wheel of the family truck, and everyone climbed inside.
Across town, on the yellowed grass outside the federal immigration building, a few activists had arrived to show their support.
Mr. Zaldivar's wife took his arm.
"Ready?" he said quietly.
Together they crossed the road, Ms. Zaldivar gripping the blue tote, and then disappeared.
His children watched.
Then, not 20 minutes in, a shout went up from one of the activists.
The Zaldivars, both of them, were walking out the building's glass doors.
Ms. Zaldivar approached her children, her voice unsteady. Her husband had been granted one more monthlong postponement, she said, but this time "he has to come back with a ticket -- a bus ticket, a plane ticket, something showing he is going to exit in 30 days."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

White farmers jailed in South Africa for killing Black teen

Texto completo: JOHANNESBURG - Two white South African farmers were sentenced to a combined 41 years in prison Wednesday for killing a Black teenager whom they had accused of stealing sunflowers, bringing to a close a case that had inflamed tensions in a rural town and exposed the nation's enduring racial divisions.
During a hearing at the High Court in Mahikeng that was packed with Black and white South Africans, Judge Ronald Hendricks described the actions of the farmers, who were convicted of throwing the 15-year-old boy off a moving truck in April 2017, as "disgraceful" and "appalling."
The boy, Matlhomola Mosweu, died after breaking his neck. His death set off riots in the town of Coligny, about 125 miles west of Johannesburg.
The two farmers - Pieter Doorewaard, 28, and Phillip Schutte, 35 - were found guilty of murder, kidnapping and other charges. Doorewaard was sentenced to 18 years in prison, and Schutte to 23 years.
They had claimed that after they caught Mosweu stealing, they put him on the truck to take him to a police station. But the teenager, they said, then jumped off the vehicle.
The judge ruled that the killing had not been planned or premeditated, but had "happened on the spur of the moment." He added, "The community of Coligny was terrorized by this."
The killing prompted days of rioting and looting in the farming town, especially against white-owned businesses.
As in all of South Africa, one of the world's most unequal societies, racial tensions had simmered just below the surface in Coligny, where farms and other businesses are still largely owned by whites and other individuals who are not Black South Africans.
Most Black residents, who depend on white-owned farms for work, live in a nearby township. Mosweu had lived in a shantytown for newer arrivals, called Scotland informal settlement.
The courtroom was filled with members of the Economic Freedom Fighters, an opposition party that has long pushed for the expropriation of white-owned land without compensation. Pressure from the party, a spinoff of the governing African National Congress, has compelled the ANC to adopt a similar position under President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Texto completo: West Philadelphia native Omar Tyree's path to becoming a "New York Times" bestseller began when he introduced the 1980s coming-of-age story, "Flyy Girl."
The now urban classic novel followed the the material life of Tracy, her examination of her life, her goals, and her sexuality - "as she evolves from a Flyy Girl into a woman."
In an unprecedented power move, the "godfather of contemporary urban street lit" will publish an uncut and epic three-hour "Flyy Girl" screenplay, including a list of classic soundtrack songs from the 1980s, on Amazon.com. "I've written five screenplays in the last three months," explained Tyree. "I'm going to write all my own screen plays now and start looking at other people's screenplays because I know what quality writing is. I've got to be able to push down the doors of Hollywood, and that means I've got to excite some economic people and that happens through the numbers. And so we can't keep talking about a 25-year-old book because we got to get new energy and new numbers, and that's what this screenplay represents. We already know about the book. Now, it's about the screenplay. And the screenplay is not the same as the book, it's intensified. I added some stuff because I went all out because I know Philadelphia, the lingo, the culture, the politics - and I know the 80s. That's what you're going to get in this screenplay."
Tyree, 49, graduated from Central High School in 1987 and enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh where he initially studied to become a pharmacist, before transferring to Howard University in 1989.
In 1991, during his senior year, Tyree became the first student in Howard University's history to have a featured column published in "The Hilltop," the award-winning campus newspaper.
In 1991, Tyree received a degree in communications from Howard and shortly after, he worked as a reporter and an assistant editor at "The Capitol Spotlight," a weekly newspaper in Washington, D.C. Later, he was hired as chief reporter for News Dimensions, another Black-owned weekly newspaper.
In 1998, Tyree partnered with Simon & Schuster to produce more than 13 novels, including a reprint of "Flyy Girl" and the publication of "A Do Right Man."
In 2001, Tyree won the 2001 NAACP Image Award for outstanding literature for his book "For the Love of Money." He has also written books under the pen name of "The Urban Griot."
"I'm going to be rabble rousing and talking a whole lot of talk," Tyree adds. "My main thing is that I am a top-notch screenplay writer right now, and the Hollywood people can read my screenplay and tell me I'm not. I'm coming that hard, and I back it up, bottom line."

Debate over stock buybacks keeps raging on

Texto completo: The latest pitched battle between Corporate America and its critics involves stock buybacks: Large companies' purchases of their own shares on the stock market. The aim is to raise share prices and satisfy investors. But the practice has triggered outrage from critics, who argue that the buybacks discourage productive investment, higher wages and worker retraining. Big business is accused of sacrificing the nation's future for short-term greed.
Here's the background.
No one disputes that buybacks -- once rare -- have soared. In 2018, companies in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 firms spent a record $753 billion on buybacks, up 40 percent from 2017 and more than triple the level of 2007, according to an analysis by the Institute of International Finance (IIF), a research and advocacy group for financial firms.
Buybacks now overshadow dividends as the way companies return funds to shareholders. In 2018, dividends from these same S&P 500 firms totaled $449 billion, slightly less than in 2017, says the IIF analysis. The buybacks reduced the number of shares of the S&P companies by 3 percent, the IIF estimates.
The biggest economic sectors using buybacks are information technology companies (example: Microsoft) at $255 billion, financial firms (JPMorgan Chase) at $137 billion and health care firms (Pfizer) at $91 billion. Companies that have announced buybacks include Boeing, Johnson & Johnson and Facebook, reported CNBC, the business news channel.
What encourages buybacks? There are many causes.
One is convenience. When companies raise dividends, they are reluctant to reverse the increases -- that's an almost-certain warning that a firm is in deep trouble -- except in cases of extreme financial distress. By contrast, buybacks can be turned on and off to reflect the state of the economy, the stock market and companies' individual circumstances.
Another attraction is the stock price itself. Many executives "believe their stock is undervalued," as CNBC puts it. Buybacks try to nudge up the price -- not always successfully -- by spreading the same profit over fewer shares. President Trump's large corporate tax cut also spurred buybacks, because some of that money was funneled to shareholders, as Donald Marron of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has indicated.
(Note: Some stories put the 2018 buyback total at more than $1 trillion,compared with the IIF's $753 billion. The difference, says the IIF, is that its figures cover only buybacks that have occurred. The higher numbers also include announcements of buybacks that haven't been consummated.)
Not surprisingly, there's a backlash. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a staunch critic of buybacks, recently denounced the practice in a series of scathing tweets. Here's a sampling.
"The justification for corporate buybacks is (a) company has no better investment available. This may be true for any company from time to time. But what does it say when it is true for many companies year after year? ... Why are profits not being invested into (the) company or new companies?"
Or here are Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., writing on the op-ed page of the New York Times:
"(Buybacks reduce companies' capacity) to reinvest profits more meaningfully in the company in terms of R&D, equipment, higher wages, paid medical leave, retirement benefits and worker retraining."
What to believe? By rhetoric, the critics seem winners. Corporate America seems to be hunkering down and enjoying short-term returns at the expense of the future. But this is a superficial reading.
On paper, it seems reasonable to discourage buybacks by imposing stiff taxes on them. However, this turns out to be harder than it seems. For starters, the present tax rate for Americans receiving capital gains from buybacks is the same as the tax rate on qualified dividends, 23.8 percent, notes Steven M. Rosenthal, also of the Tax Policy Center. Buybacks aren't being wildly subsidized.
Even if they were, the effect of raising the tax on buybacks would be modest, Rosenthal says. Many investors are tax-exempt. These include foreign investors in U.S. stocks, U.S. pension funds, IRAs, 401(k)s, and other tax-exempt institutions. All together they represent about 75 percent of publicly traded U.S. shares, says Rosenthal. All these non-taxable investors would still have reason to favor buybacks.
More important, even banning buybacks outright might not work as critics think. Imagine a world in which buybacks are illegal and companies hoard most of the funds now used for buybacks. (Schumer and Sanders support one such approach.) All that spare cash might encourage executives to undertake wasteful projects or to engineer ever-larger mergers -- and be criticized by the same critics for doing so.
Buybacks are the better solution. Funnel some of companies' surplus profits to shareholders, who can best decide what to do with the cash.

"A feminist foreign policy is an analysis of the world."
-- Margot Wallstrom, Sweden's foreign minister, who introduced a "feminist foreign policy" in 2014, placing gender equality at the core of Sweden's international relations.
______
What's so great about Sweden? Every year, the Nordic nation seems to rank highly on lists of the happiest, friendliest, most environmentally conscious countries in the world. But its another title it often claims that caught my eye: one of the best places to be a woman.
This week, Sweden was one of the top three countries (along with Iceland and New Zealand) on the Women in Work Index 2019, a comprehensive assessment of female economic empowerment across 33 member countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. (You can find the United States at No. 23, dropping two slots since last year's report.)
But what does it really take to become one of the world's most gender-equal societies? In Sweden's case, it's largely policy and legislation.
Here are several ways Sweden leads on gender issues.
Putting "feminism" front and center
In 2014, Sweden became the first government to use the word "feminist" to describe a policy approach. (On its official website, the nation even refers to itself as "a feminist government.")
Sweden's feminist foreign policy (yes, really) places gender equality at the core of the government's priorities -- from decision-making to resource allocation.
In 2016, Margot Wallstrom, Sweden's foreign minister, who introduced the policy, told The New York Times that a feminist foreign policy uses the usual tools of diplomacy to address three questions: Do women have equal rights? Are women at the decision-making table? And are resources equitably distributed to women?
Policy objectives include women's and girls' freedom from physical, psychological and sexual violence; political participation and influence in all areas of society; economic rights and empowerment; and sexual and reproductive health and rights.
Offering 480 days of parental leave
Sweden, which has a population of about 10 million people, has the most generous paid parental leave policy in the world. Parents get 480 days of leave to share, 390 of which are paid out at 80 percent. (Single parents are entitled to the full 480 days.) These days can be used until the child turns 8. Sweden's parental leave policy also applies to adopting parents.
Deconstructing gender in education
Starting with preschool, many of Sweden's government-funded schools are doing what they can to "counteract traditional gender roles and gender patterns," my colleague Ellen Barry reported last year. State curriculum even "urges preschool teachers and principals to embrace their role as social engineers."
How are they doing that? Preschool teachers, for example, "avoid referring to their students' gender," Barry reported. They say "friends" instead of "boys and girls," and play is organized to prevent children from sorting themselves by gender.
Today, girls generally earn better grades and perform better in national tests than boys, according to Sweden's official website. And women now earn nearly two-thirds of all university degrees in Sweden. (Oh yeah, another thing: Swedish colleges and universities are free.)
Adopting gender-neutral pronouns (and quickly)
In 2012, the gender-neutral pronoun "hen" was introduced and swiftly absorbed into mainstream Swedish culture, something that, linguists say, has never happened in another country.
Prosecuting crimes against women
Last year, the Swedish Parliament passed a law requiring explicit consent from participants before they engage in a sexual act. "Sex must be voluntary -- if it is not, then it is illegal" was the language used in the law, which aims to change the way sexual crimes are prosecuted in the country.
And 20 years earlier, in 1998, Sweden passed the Act on Violence Against Women, which pertains to crimes against women by current or former spouses or live-in partners. Under the law, men can be sentenced for each instance of physical abuse or sexual and psychological degradation against a woman.
Navigating ups and downs in business and politics
Women held only 6 percent of chief executive positions in Swedish companies listed on its stock exchange, 29 percent of company board seats and only 5 percent of board chairs, according to a biannual report on gender equality published in 2016 from Statistics Sweden, a government agency.
And on average, women's monthly salaries are about 88 percent of men's, or 95.5 percent when profession and sector are taken into account.
Yet on the flip side, 97 women and 102 men led Sweden's public agencies in 2015, positions appointed by the government, which also sets the salaries for the posts. And of the 10 highest paid appointees, four were women.
Sweden also has one of the world's highest proportions of female lawmakers. After the 2018 election, women occupied 161 of the 349 seats.

31 Days of Women: Noor Inayat Khan, Indian princess and British spy
For women's history month, we're highlighting stories of trailblazing women you may not know, but should. We'll bring you two women each week in this newsletter; head over to our Instagram for daily posts.
Noor Inayat Khan was not what one would expect of a British spy. She was a princess, having been born to Indian royalty, a Muslim, a writer and a musician. But she was exactly what Britain's military intelligence needed in World War II.
She joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in 1940 and became the first female radio operator to be sent by Britain into occupied France. Within 10 days of her arrival, all the other British agents had been arrested. Her superiors wanted her to return to Britain, but she refused, saying she would try to rebuild the network on her own. Read more about Noor Inayat Khan here.

Mueller's Report Is a Hit, Sight Unseen

Texto completo: The legions of reporters and commentators following every move by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, do not know when he will finish investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. And it is unclear whether the report he is expected to file will ever become public.
That hasn't stopped two publishers from setting a date, March 26, for when people can buy their book versions of the eagerly anticipated document. One online outlet is already describing one of those books as a bona fide hit.
Amazon's listing for "The Mueller Report: The Final Report of the Special Counsel into Donald Trump, Russia and Collusion," carries a "best seller" label based on pre-orders. On Barnes & Noble's website, the publisher Skyhorse is promoting the $9.40 paperback -- with Mr. Mueller and the Department of Justice as authors -- as "required reading."
For $10.50, readers can also put in an advanced order for "The Mueller Report" from The Washington Post and the Simon & Schuster imprint Scribner, which bills the report as "the most anticipated investigative document of this century."
The question of when Mr. Mueller will file his report has been a topic of heated speculation for some time, with the fever rising in recent weeks. But his investigation is among the most tightly guarded government operations in memory. The "Game of Thrones" series finale probably has a better chance of being leaked than details from inside Mr. Mueller's inquiry.
Do the publishers know something everyone else doesn't?
It turns out, they do not. The publishing date for the Skyhorse book is "fluid," Nick Magliato, a project editor for the company, said on Thursday. To clear up any confusion, the company plans to add a note specifying that the listed date is only a placeholder.
Mr. Magliato said those working on the Skyhorse project initially thought the Mueller report would come this week, giving them time to read, typeset and print a hard copy by March 26, with an e-book available in under 48 hours.
What if Attorney General William P. Barr chooses not to make large parts of it public? Will buyers of the Skyhorse book, listed at 960 pages, receive something the size of "Gone With the Wind" with many pages of shruggie emoticons? Or will the book perhaps be similar to another title now available on Amazon, "A Comprehensive Review of the Lies in the Mueller Report: Exhaustive Analysis of Each and Every Specific Lie," which features more than 100 blank pages?
The listed page count of Skyhorse's book "is a complete guess" and is subject to change, Mr. Magliato said.
And if the contents of the report are kept entirely confidential?
"Then we don't publish it, unfortunately," Mr. Magliato said. Advance orders would be canceled and payments refunded, he said. (That happened, he said, when the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos lost his book deal with Simon & Schuster in 2017).
Brian Belfiglio, Scribner's publicity director, said his company had also settled on March 26 as a placeholder date for The Post's book because retailers planning to sell it wanted something specific for their online listings. If the report is made public sooner, he said, the book will be published sooner. If the results are delayed, the sale date will be pushed back.
The Post plans to supplement its version with reporting and commentary by the newspaper's reporters. In a statement, Martin Baron, The Post's executive editor, said the book would help "in providing context and perspective" during "a supremely important moment in American history."
Skyhorse, an independent publisher, has lined up Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor whose criticism of Mr. Mueller's investigation has won him praise from President Trump and disdain from the Martha's Vineyard elite, to write an introduction. The publisher, whose recent titles include books about WikiLeaks, the video game Fortnite, slow cooker recipes and a sloth, previously published Mr. Dershowitz's book "The Case Against the Democratic House Impeaching Trump."
The Skyhorse website's page has a section for reviews, which includes this blurb from the journalist Dan Rather: "There's never been anything like this in American history." The website does not say the quote is from a CNN segment in August, or that he was talking about President Trump's political and legal problems.
Despite being listed by Skyhorse as an author, Mr. Mueller would not receive any profits from a book bearing his name. Under federal law, work prepared by United States government is in the public domain.
Books based on government reports are not unusual, and they sometimes gain commercial success.
In 1998, The Post and the publisher Public Affairs released "The Starr Report: The Findings of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr on President Clinton and the Lewinsky Affair," a paperback version of the report prepared by Mr. Starr, the independent counsel.
The book, along with two other editions, hit the top of The New York Times's best-seller list when it was released, said Jaime Leifer, the publicity director for Public Affairs. It has sold 160,000 copies to date.

Texto completo: With tax season soon approaching, there's been a lot of talk about what President Donald Trump's tax scam means for average Americans. There's no doubt about what it means for the wealthy; millionaires and billionaires are getting a big tax break, while companies like Amazon and Netflix are paying $0 in federal taxes.
And as I discussed a few weeks ago in my column, many working people are getting far less in tax returns than they usually do. But one part of Trump's tax plan that's been grossly overlooked are the "Opportunity Zones" it's creating in cities across the country.
On the surface, the idea behind these Opportunity Zones that were part of Trump's plan, passed in December 2017 is that, by giving tax breaks to investors, they will be encouraged to put their money into communities that still haven't fully recovered from the Great Recession. (The law allows states to designate up to 25 percent of their low income neighborhoods to quality for these incentives). But in reality, this will create a gentrification juggernaut that could possibly ruin pockets of cities which are already experiencing gentrification. And it will make the rich far richer.
To understand how the Opportunity Zones work, you have to understand how capital gains taxes work. Capital gains are profits from things like selling investment property, stocks, art, and other wealthy people stuff. They are typically at about 24 percent, and while they are in some cases lower than the tax rates you and I pay on our incomes, the new program allows investors to avoid paying that tax by putting their profits directly into an Opportunity Zone fund. They can then use this money to develop something in a neighborhood that is designated as Opportunity Zone. An investor who holds onto the investment for seven years gets another 15 percent tax break on the original capital gains. Plus, and here's the real kicker, they would owe zero taxes on any profits if they keep the investment for at least 10 years.
These Opportunity Zones are essentially creating tax havens for the one percent right in the centers of our cities.
Right now there are about 8,700 "Opportunity Zones" across all 50 states, plus DC and Puerto Rico. While this might have the potential to do good things in Rust Belt cities where the economy is stagnant, it has crushing possibilities for places that are already on the upswing.
A website called Fundrise, which touts itself as "The first simple, low-cost real estate investment platform" has an article titled the "Top 10 Opportunity Zones in the U.S." and can you guess what city holds down the number one spot? If you said "Oakland" you won ... well probably a future eviction. The Oakland neighborhoods of West Oakland, Uptown, Jingletown, and Coliseum Industrial are the top Opportunity Zones in the country. The rest of the top 10 list are neighborhoods in cities like Los Angeles, San Jose, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, and more.
Are you starting to see how this is a major problem? The neighborhoods in Opportunity Zones in these cities are already on their way to being developed. Often the only thing holding them back are neighborhood activists working with local governments to make it harder for vultures and speculators to get in there.
In San Francisco, we've witnessed what happens when these kinds of investors get their way. As we saw with Mayor Ed Lee's Twitter Tax break, these kinds of tax giveaways, in areas that are already having financial success, do nothing to help the people that are already living there. They end up making lots of money for a very small group of elites who profit off regular working people losing their homes and communities.
If there's one thing the past decade in the Bay Area has shown us it's that hedge funds, venture capital firms, investment banks, money managers, and market-rate real estate developers don't care about anyone other than their investors and their share holders. And these disgusting vultures are lining up to prey on our cities.
According to the New York Times over 80 "Opportunity Funds" have been started since January, and they are raising tens of billions of dollars to dump into these communities.
As expected, most of the funds have focused on real estate investment. There is a tiny ray of hope though. In the same article the New York Times, discusses a small group of impact investors trying to figure out how to use Opportunity Zones the right way. They are focusing on places that actually need the financial help, as well as trying to set up accountability standards like financing local businesses and creating good jobs, instead of funding luxury condos. At the moment the Federal Government has no standards as to what the development of these Opportunity Zones look like.
Hopefully these impact investors succeed because otherwise there'll be no regular people left in our cities.
Shout out to my buddy Jordan Miller for hipping me to this travesty.

For Democrats to win, they must avoid leftist mythmaking

Texto completo: At 29, with her Puerto Rican heritage, megawatt smile and 3 million-plus Twitter followers, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embodies the rising power of younger female nonwhite digital natives in American politics. If Hillary Rodham Clinton, or HRC, reflects the past, AOC foreshadows the future.
But as a role model for Democrats who desperately want to defeat Donald Trump, AOC is not A-OK. She represents New York City, one of the most liberal cities in the country, and as a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, her radical views on issues like "Medicare-for-all" and a "Green New Deal" fall far outside her party’s mainstream — let alone the national consensus. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 18 percent viewed the term "socialist" favorably.
"There is, without a doubt, a myth that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez somehow represents the narrative of Democratic primary voters in the country," Democratic pollster John Anzalone told The Washington Post. "Almost half of them identify themselves as moderates or conservatives."
Moreover, she reflects an intolerant impulse among Democratic leftists to purge the party of moderate heretics. After 26 of her fellow House members voted with Republicans to make it harder for undocumented immigrants to purchase guns, AOC threatened to put them "on a list" for primary challenges.
"Since when is it OK to put you on a Nixonian list?" Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, co-chair of the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus, protested in the Post. "We need to have a big tent in our party, or we won’t keep the House or win the White House."
The myth Anzalone identifies has bedeviled the Democratic Party since the death of Franklin Roosevelt 74 years ago. Liberals do form a critical component of the party’s "big tent" coalition, and no Democratic nominee can win the White House without their support. That’s why the far-too-late and far-too-grudging endorsement of Clinton by Bernie Sanders (or BS) was so damaging.
That said, Democrats cannot capture the presidency or either branch of Congress by lurching leftward. A candidate in the AOC/BS mold would be a hero in New York, California and Massachusetts — and a disaster in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which handed Trump the presidency in 2016 and will be critical again next year.
Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania, stressed this point to The New York Times: "The more we have presidential candidates or newly elected congresspeople talking about the Green New Deal, talking about ‘Medicare-for-all,’ talking about socialism, the more that plays into the Trump campaign’s hands."
Christopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, added: "If you want to lock up Pennsylvania for a Democrat, the more moderate Democrats are the key."
The numbers support them. A Gallup poll in January reported that 35 percent of Americans call themselves conservatives, the same number that identify as moderates. Only 26 percent are self-described liberals, the same portion who chose that label in 2016 exit polls.
It’s true that within the Democrats’ ranks, the percentage of liberals is rising, hitting 51 percent this year according to Gallup. But pragmatists still dominate the party. Fifty-four percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the party to "move closer to the center" while 41 percent "would rather it shift further left."
The same tension between purists and pragmatists is playing out in the House, where the AOC types are calling for the rapid impeachment of the president. But Democratic leaders are taking a much slower approach, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, insisting that impeachment must meet a "very high bar."
"If you’re serious about removing a president from office, what you’re really doing is overturning the result of the last election," Nadler told Roll Call in November. "You don’t want to have a situation where you tear this country apart, and for the next 30 years half the country’s saying, ‘We won the election; you stole it.’" That’s why Democrats should be focusing on the next election, not impeachment. No president has ever been removed through impeachment (although Richard Nixon probably would have been the first, had he not resigned). The bar is and should be "very high."
But denying a president a second term through the ballot box is quite common, and in fact happened three times in five elections between 1976 and 1992. That bar is much lower and well within the reach of Democrats if they can avoid the mythmaking of leftists like AOC and BS and focus on political reality.

Michael Cohen's attorney said former lawyer sought Trump pardon

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Michael Cohen directed his former lawyer to approach President Donald Trump about a pardon, his current attorney confirmed Thursday.
But Lanny Davis said the revelation does not conflict with his client's congressional testimony in late February in which Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, claimed he never asked for a pardon.
In a statement Thursday, Davis stressed that Cohen’s willingness to explore a pardon ended when Cohen pulled out of a joint defense agreement with the president's legal team. He said that was when Cohen "authorized me as a new lawyer to say publicly Mr. Cohen would never accept a pardon from President Trump even if offered. "
"That continues to be the case," Davis said. "And his statement at the Oversight Hearing was true – and consistent with his post-joint-defense-agreement commitment to tell the truth. "
Testifying under oath, Cohen told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, "I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump. "
Davis told ABC News that Cohen's statement was "literally true. "
Cohen "never asked President Trump for a pardon," he said. "His lawyer explored the disingenuous 'dangle' repeatedly floated by Rudy (Giuliani) and Trump in one meeting and never followed up. "
In his statement Thursday, Davis said Cohen "directed his attorney to explore possibilities of a pardon at one point with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani as well as other lawyers advising President Trump. "
Cohen testimony prompts a new question: In web of Trump investigations, is anyone safe?
'I am not protecting Mr. Trump anymore': Michael Cohen ties the president to ongoing criminal probes
More: Here's the evidence Michael Cohen shared with Congress, showing hush money payments and Trump's finances
The New York Times reported Wednesday that Giuliani said he had been contacted by "lawyers for several people" who have become embroiled in the Justice Department investigations around the president. But he said he could not confirm Davis' assertion because of attorney-client privilege.
Giuliani said Trump's policy has been not to consider granting any pardons until the investigations are concluded.
"I always gave one answer, and they always left disappointed," Giuliani said.
Citing unnamed sources, The Washington Post reported that Cohen told lawmakers during closed-door sessions that Trump attorney Jay Sekulow was also part of the pardon discussions. But the paper said Sekulow flatly denied it and said Cohen's claim was "not true. "
Sekulow also has denied Cohen's allegation that he helped alter Cohen's previous testimony to Congress. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about when negotiations over a Trump Tower Moscow project ended. Cohen told lawmakers that Trump's lawyers, including Sekulow, had altered his testimony to obscure the Trump Tower timeline.
Sekulow told The Post the claim was "completely false. "
Cohen reportedly offered lawmakers a marked-up copy of that testimony to back up his claim. But The Post reported that a person who had seen the document said the changes "were not substantive" and were not about the Moscow project.
Republicans on Capitol Hill and other Trump supporters have cast doubt on Cohen's credibility since he began to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller. Those attacks were ratcheted up when Cohen – who had already been sentenced to three years in prison, in part for lying to Congress – implicated Trump in illegal activity during his explosive congressional testimony.
On Twitter, Trump has written several posts accusing Cohen of contradictions between his testimony, where he called Trump a "cheat" and a "racist," and a manuscript he wrote before his legal troubles began, which Trump said was flattering of the president.
After Cohen's testimony, Oversight Committee Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , sent a 30-page letter to Attorney General William Barr in which they referred Cohen for investigation on perjury charges. They accused him of "intentionally false statements designed to make himself look better on a national stage. "
Davis called the referral a "sad misuse of the criminal justice system. "

Texto completo: The Ford Plantation, an 1,800-acre private community in Richmond Hill, has announced its final phase of home development, Silk Hope.
The member-backed project, which is limited to 53 homes, will be the first new for sale residential development at The Ford Plantation in more than 15 years. The first model homes, currently under construction, will be available this fall.
The Silk Hope community, which aims to capture both the tranquil feeling of a European village and Lowcountry architecture, is the product of a collaboration of some of the world's top residential architects and landscape designers, including Savannah-based architect, Christian Sottile, who conceived and designed the master plan for the community.
Sottile, owner of the international award-winning firm, Sottile & Sottile, is known for civic planning and architectural repurposing in historic cities. His work has been featured in numerous publications including New York Times, Preservation Magazine, and Architectural Digest.
The homes will feature spacious master suite ground-floor living, fireplaces, golf cart and car garages, as well as high-end finishes. The conceptual designs for the homes were produced by world-renowned architect, Bobby McAlpine, of McAlpine Architecture in conjunction with Tippett Sease Baker Architecture of Atlanta.
Silk Hope will offer 12 home styles ranging from a 3,000 square foot 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath Village home to Estate homes greater than 5,200 square feet.

I'm buying the unit above my condo and would like to install a spiral staircase to save room. Everyone I know warns me that spiral staircases are huge pains. Do you agree?
Spiral staircases do indeed have their drawbacks. They can be uncomfortable to climb, create a weird, useless space behind them and make moving anything up or down an ordeal. Since you're combining apartments, you presumably have an entry door from the corridor at each level and can disregard that third point. But lack of comfort is still the killer.
As for the potential space savings, a caveat: While some spiral stair kits are available with diameters as small as 42 inches, that's a tight space through which to squeeze a body as you wind around a central newel post. Commodious spiral stairs tend to be more like 60 inches in diameter -- but you'll still find each tread narrowing to a sliver at the newel.
So why not consider cutting a slightly larger rectangular opening and installing a more conventional compact stair like those offered by Arke? The company's Kompact 35-inch kit can be configured for an opening of 79 by 64 inches, but reward you with spacious 33.5 inch-wide treads, only six out of 12 of which are winders if your floor-to-floor height is around 9 feet 6 inches. It will ride much more like a traditional stair -- and look like one, hugging the walls with no odd void. As described, the kit will cost $3,917.
For a while there, I was a Marie Kondo disciple, but now I find myself regretting getting rid of so much stuff so suddenly. Her book "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing" actually has a chapter forbidding altering the method! And it doesn't seem to address the regular influx of new things. How do we moderate between clutter and clear-cutting?
If you're thinking about switching home organizational handbooks, Margareta Magnusson's "The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning: How to Free Yourself and Your Family From a Lifetime of Clutter," is, well, gentler. While Ms. Kondo asks you to ponder what you want to bring into the future, Ms. Magnusson's message is about paring down as you go (and go); she cheerily advises taking time to sort through possessions even as she raises the specter of mortality. Ms. Kondo doesn't want anyone ever picking through your castaways; Ms. Magnusson lets you regift. It made me want to start death cleaning early. One unspoken takeaway: Make sure everything in your shopping cart sparks joy in the first place.
I have a Knoll chair designed by Jens Risom whose woven cotton webbing -- the main seating element -- is soiled. Cleaning experts say they're concerned that the solvents will discolor the material. But tossing a throw to hide the dirt destroys the chair's beautiful lines. Any suggestions?
Cleaning old fabric is a tricky business. But depending on the severity and age of the stains, you could try a mild cleaner like Folex -- first testing it on the chair's underside, to make sure it doesn't alter the color.
Failing that, Knoll recommends Prestige Furniture & Design Group in Woodside, Queens, to re-web the chair. They can supply you with new webbing to match the original, or the newer Sunbrella outdoor webbing, which helps guard against dirt and is easier to clean. The cost of labor is $240, and webbing from Knoll, which Prestige will supply, is $125.
I am considering a sofa pit but worry about the ease of getting in and out, the awkwardness of asking guests to jump in, and the possibility that it will overwhelm the room. What do you think?
In my view, sofa pits raise one important question: Why not just watch TV in bed? However, I understand that when guests come for movie or game night, lounging in the bedroom isn't an option.
You can mitigate the awkwardness by using a sectional sofa pit and making sure that the ottoman or ottomans are on wheels, or lightweight enough to be moved around easily. Since the ottomans basically replace a coffee table, it's a good idea to have drink trays that can rest on top. Also, consider using pull-up side tables, like West Elm's Charley C-Side Table (from $159). But take care that whatever table you pick clears the height of the sofa.
In terms of scale, a good rule of thumb is to match the size of the sofa pit to the area that would be collectively consumed by a regular sofa, coffee table and easy chairs. If it still seems too monolithic covering the "sofa" and "ottoman" portions in different, complementary fabrics will break up the scale.
You should also think about task lighting. Conventional table lamps may not throw their beams far enough to brighten every part of your pit. But there are lamps with greater reach, like CB2's Beam Floor Lamp ($259).

Texto completo: Every time he speaks to Rotary, Kiwanis or other groups, Larry Gregory says people ask if casino tax revenue isn't supposed to be pumping millions of dollars into schools across Mississippi.
Every time he tells the audience it's a misconception, said Gregory, executive director of the Mississippi Gaming and Hospitality Association and former executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Association. If there had been talk about education becoming a major beneficiary when voters approved casinos back in the early 1990s, he said it didn't make it into any of the regulations.
It's not in the Mississippi Gaming Control Act or other legal document that casino tax revenue specifically would benefit education throughout the state, he said.
A 1990 report in the the New York Times said new jobs, large payrolls, revenue for cities and counties and more business for local suppliers were what residents and officials hoped the casinos would bring. It didn't mention schools being the priority.
State regulations do say schools get a percentage of the tax at the local level.
Casino revenue a windfall for some school districts, not others In Biloxi, in Tunica and other cities and counties where casinos flourished, schools have shared in the prosperity.
"They've got a windfall given to them that the other school districts don't," Gregory said.
On the 25th anniversary of casinos in Mississippi in 2017, Mississippi Gaming and Hospitality Association reported that Mississippi casinos had paid $6.5 billion in state taxes and $638 million in taxes for local education over the first 25 years.
In the first five years of the casino industry in south Mississippi, $26 million in tax revenue was funneled to local schools, according to a 1997 article in the Sun Herald. Gulfport schools collected $3.9 million of that total, the report said, and used the money for more teachers, better libraries, newer computers and indoor physical education rooms in every grade school.
"Gaming dollars are doing so much right now that has been neglected for 37 years," said Larry Drawdy, superintendent at the Biloxi School District at that time. "We were at a point where we would have had to raise local property taxes or do without and have less than a quality standard of education."
There were drawbacks. Schools that didn't get tax money from the casinos struggled to offer competitive salaries while teachers in gambling towns got raises, the article said.
Before casinos, Tunica County schools spent less per student and had the lowest test scores in the state, according to a 1999 case study. By 1997, more than $3 million a year was going to the local schools, according to "The Effects of Casino Gaming on Tunica County." But the report says the school system was still under control of the state. Instead of going to college, the report said bright high school graduates were going to work at the casinos.
Casinos and schools: How the local distribution works Mississippi casinos pay 12 percent tax on gross gaming revenue. While most businesses pay taxes on profits, casinos pay this 12 percent tax on winnings before deducting the cost of wages, insurance and other expenses of doing business.
The breakdown from there is:
8 percent goes to the state general fund, which is used in part for education. $3 million goes to the bond sinking fund to pay for improvements to state roads and bridges.
Up to 4 percent — of the 12 percent — is split between local governments and schools. In Biloxi, for instance, 40 percent goes into the city general fund, 20 percent to city public safety, 20 percent to Biloxi School District, 10 percent is distributed to public schools in Harrison County and 10 percent to Harrison County.
Of the 151 school districts in Mississippi, only the districts in the seven counties where casinos operate benefit from the local distribution.
Biloxi School District receives about $6 million a year from the tax on gross casino revenue, which Shane Switzer, director of business, says is about 10 percent of the school's overall budget. The addition of sports betting has boosted the city's share by more than $200,000 since the state fiscal year began in July.
"In addition to the gaming revenue tax, we also receive ad valorem taxes from both land assessments and personal property assessments," he said. Casinos pay a local fee on each slot machine, along with other use and wage taxes. Mississippi's casinos had nearly 20,000 employees and a monthly payroll of $51 million in December 2018.
Casino taxes go into general fund that provides money for education Under Florida law, all tax revenue from slot machines goes to Florida's Educational Enhancement Trust Fund to be distributed to school districts and public colleges, along with providing financial aid to Florida students.
Missouri is another state that directs a large portion of casino taxes to education, according to the American Gaming Association.
Although Mississippi doesn't have these provisions, casinos' taxes do benefit all school districts throughout the state, said Kathy Waterbury with the Department of Revenue.
Nearly all of the tax on gross gaming revenue the state collects this year will go into the general fund that provides money for education.
A portion of the sales tax collected at casinos and other businesses across Mississippi is dedicated to education, Waterbury said.
"In fiscal year 2018, DOR transferred more than $2 billion in sales tax revenue to the state's general fund," she said. These transfers are made after all other diversions are paid to cities and for hotel and other special taxes.
She said 2.266 percent of the total sales tax revenue is deposited in the School Ad Valorem Fund up to a total of $42 million annually.
Anything over $42 million is transferred to the Education Enhancement Fund, which also receives 9 percent of the state tax revenue. That amounted to $299 million last year, she said.
More for education? That's up to the state lawmakers. In 2015 House Bill 1630 changed the way casino revenue was split and directed revenue that previously was earmarked for bridges and highways near casinos to instead be used throughout the state.
The changes didn't provide additional money for education.
Waterbury said the Legislature allocated a portion of the $3 million-a-month bond sinking fund and in 2016 provided $500,000 each month to the Gulfport Aquarium Construction Fund, $41,663 for Catfish Row Museum Construction Fund and $83,334 to Bass Cultural Arts Center Fund. In 2017, another $500,000 a month from the bond sinking fund was earmarked for construction of the Gulfport aquarium. Beginning in 2018, all $3 million a month is again directed to the bond sinking fund.
The state Legislature had another opportunity to direct gambling money to education in 2018, when after years of debate, a lottery bill finally passed in Mississippi.
Unlike Louisiana, where 35 percent of lottery winnings help fund education across the state, Mississippi legislators chose to make the state's crumbling roads and bridges the priority.
Education will get a share of the lottery proceeds in Mississippi if there is any remaining revenue after $80 million a year is spent on roads and bridges.

Warner Bros. Lands a Big Fish: Hello Kitty Goes Hollywood

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- For the first time, Hello Kitty is coming to Hollywood.
But will a character who never talks finally get to speak?
Warner Bros. said on Tuesday that its New Line division and the producer Beau Flynn had persuaded the Sanrio Corporation of Tokyo -- after a five-year courtship -- to entrust its $6 billion cat to the studio for a feature film. Sanrio, which created Hello Kitty in 1974 and groomed her into a merchandising superstar, has never brought the character to global movie screens. That has allowed her to remain silent: Hello Kitty has no mouth.
Well-known intellectual properties of all kinds -- even apps and emojis -- have become coveted by movie studios like Warner as a way to compete with a free-spending Netflix and a supersized Disney. "It's a rare privilege to have the opportunity to explore the possibilities of such timeless I.P.," Carolyn Blackwood and Richard Brener, the presidents of New Line, said in a statement about their feline coup.
The film deal also involves related merchandise rights and possible spinoff projects. Terms were not disclosed. New Line can use roughly 20 Sanrio characters, including the popular Gudetama, a disgruntled cracked egg, and My Melody, a rabbit who wears long ear warmers. (No word about Spottie Dottie, a Dalmatian with a pink headband.)
"I am extremely pleased that Hello Kitty and other popular Sanrio characters will be making their Hollywood debut," Shintaro Tsuji, Sanrio's nonagenarian founder and chief executive, said in a statement, calling the cat "a symbol of friendship."
Bringing the whiskered character to global movie screens as an attraction for both children and adults, as planned, will require Warner and Sanrio to walk a tightrope. Films require characters to evolve. (A script has not yet been written, nor writers hired.) But if she changes too much, fans will yowl.
Licensing experts say Kitty's popularity -- she appears on 50,000 different products in 130 countries -- involves simplicity: Because the character does not emote, people of all ages and nationalities can project themselves on her. A talking Kitty was once created for a pilot cartoon series in Japan, causing fans loyal to the cat's mouthless look to become apoplectic, a Sanrio designer told The New York Times in 2010.
Her identity has prompted other uproars, including when the curator of a 2014 Hello Kitty exhibit at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, citing pushback from Sanrio, pronounced that the cutesy character was not actually a cat.
"I was corrected -- very firmly," the curator, Christine R. Yano, said at the time. "She's a cartoon character. She is a little girl. She is a friend. But she is not a cat. She is never depicted on all fours."
The internet melted down. Sanrio eventually clarified its position -- she is "a personification of a cat," the company said -- and world order was restored.
Mr. Flynn, the producer who chased Sanrio for the film rights, declined to discuss potential changes to the character, including the possibility of speaking.
"We have some pretty exciting ideas about Kitty, who always speaks from her heart," Mr. Flynn said, adding that it was too early to say whether the movie would be fully animated or an animation-live action hybrid.
Mr. Flynn, whose credits include "Journey to the Center of the Earth," "San Andreas" and "Requiem for a Dream," started his Hello Kitty quest about five years ago. It took him more than two years just to get a meeting with Mr. Tsuji, who finally agreed in 2016. Mr. Flynn and Toby Emmerich, chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, flew to Japan and first visited Sanrio's Puroland theme park, where they rode rides.
Big-screen animation has been a weak spot for Warner. "The Lego Movie" was a smash hit for the studio in 2014, but more recent installments in that overworked franchise have fallen short at the box office. The musical "Smallfoot," released in September, was also a disappointment.
But Warner is working harder to become a more consistent player in animation. On Monday, Kevin Tsujihara, the studio's chairman, was given expanded responsibilities for children's entertainment and merchandising at WarnerMedia, which is owned by AT&T and includes properties like Warner Bros., HBO and cable channels like Cartoon Network, TNT and TBS.
In production or development at the studio are movies that seek to revive characters in the company's Looney Tunes and Hanna-Barbera libraries, including new takes on Scooby-Doo, Wile E. Coyote, the Jetsons, the Flintstones, and Tom and Jerry.
And now comes a white bobtail cat. "In a fast-moving world inundated with content," said Mr. Flynn, "Hello Kitty has not only survived but thrived, and the reason involves what she stands for -- individualism, tolerance and friendship."

House Republican: Omar should be named in Democrats' anti-Semitism resolution

Texto completo: A key House Republican called on his Democratic counterparts Tuesday to name Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., in the resolution they are proposing to indirectly rebuke the freshman congresswoman over her anti-Israel comments.

A spokesman for Rep. Ted Budd, R-N.C., told the Washington Examiner "condemning anti-Semitism shouldn’t be a partisan issue." Budd, along with New York Republican Reps. Lee Zeldin and Elise Stefanik, have been pushing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to bring their own measure condemning anti-Semitism in Congress and on college campuses to the chamber's floor.

"In January, the House voted on a resolution condemning white nationalism, naming Rep. Steve King specifically. In this resolution condemning anti-Semitism, Rep. Omar should be named as well," Chase Jennings, Budd's communications director, said.

The congressman himself tweeted earlier Tuesday, denouncing Omar's anti-Israel remarks, which many have interpreted as anti-Semitic.

Zeldin's spokeswoman, Katie Vincentz, did not immediately respond to follow-up questions from the Washington Examiner regarding whether Omar should be referenced in the House Democrats' measure. Instead, she reiterated Zeldin's other demand in response to Omar's statements.

"Rep. Omar should be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee," Vincentz said.

House Democrats will on Wednesday vote on the four-page resolution, sponsored by Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla. The measure “rejects anti-Semitism as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States," as well as outlines the history of anti-Semitic attacks against Jews and addresses “the myth of dual loyalty."

Omar first clashed with House Republicans last month over her views on Jewish influence in U.S. politics. But over the weekend, she feuded openly on Twitter with another House Democrat, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., after questioning whether supporters of Israel have a "dual loyalty" to both the U.S. and Israel.

King, R-Iowa, was in January the subject of a resolution of disapproval introduced by House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., which noted comments he made to the New York Times that many called racist.

Texto completo: Maine Democrat comes under fire from gun control group and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Democrat comes under fire from gun control group, NY Rep. Ocasio-Cortez
With votes last week against more gun control and in favor of a proposal to help crack down on undocumented immigrants, Maine Democrat Jared Golden is drawing fire from his party’s left wing.
Golden’s opposition to expanded background checks spurred supporters of the measure to run advertising accusing him of siding with the gun lobby while his backing of a GOP-sponsored amendment to bolster the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raised hackles from at least one of the party’s most high-profile newcomers.
Golden is among a small group of Democratic lawmakers whose votes have upset liberal firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term Democrat from New York, enough for her to speak out against them.
She said she is unhappy with a small “moderate wing,” which includes Golden, because its supporters opposed California Democrat Nancy Pelosi for speaker, supported compromise on President Donald Trump’s proposal wall and backed ICE.
Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, a group devoted to what it calls “common sense” gun regulation, has taken out at least 135 social media advertisements in the past few days on Facebook alone to go after the first-term, 2nd District member of Congress.
In its ads, the group insists Golden “failed us” and “sided with the gun lobby” in his opposition to background checks on most private gun transfers and for another bill to give the FBI more time to carry out the checks before a sale goes through.
Though neither bill is expected to secure backing in the Senate — and President Donald Trump has already vowed to veto them should they reach his desk — their passage marked the first time in more than two decades a piece of major gun control legislation passed either chamber of Congress.
Golden, one of two Democrats to oppose expanded background checks, said in a prepared statement he voted against them because the proposal is nearly the same as a 2016 Maine ballot question opposed by constituents in all of the counties he represents.
“Maine isn’t Chicago, Washington or New York,” he said. “For many of my constituents, access to firearms is a necessary part of daily life, and we have a tradition of responsible gun ownership.”
Everytown responded to the win by targeting eight lawmakers who voted against the bill, including both Democrats who opposed expanded checks: Golden and Collin Peterson of Minnesota. It said it planned to spend $200,000 assailing the bill’s opponents in swing districts.
“For those elected leaders who put the gun lobby ahead of the safety of their constituents, we’re sending a clear message: Do so at your own peril,” the president of the group, John Feinblatt, said in a prepared statement.
The pro-gun control group said Golden voted against the proposal “even though background checks reduce gun violence and save lives.”
In one of the ads against Golden, Everytown called on 2nd District voters to “let him know how disappointed you are that he put the interests of the gun lobby over the safety of his constituents.”
Golden, though, did not hesitate to defend his vote.
“Mainers in every county in my district were very clear: They don’t support expanding background checks to make some transfers between friends and family illegal,” he said Monday. “This one-size-fits-all approach to gun control doesn’t work for our state.
“Special interest groups can ignore the will of Mainers in the 2nd District all they want, but I stand by my vote and I stand with my constituents.”
Mainers rejected virtually the same proposal when it reached the 2016 ballot as a citizens’ initiative, with the 2nd District voting it down by a nearly 2-1 margin.
It is not just Golden’s vote on the gun measure that is drawing criticism.
Before the final vote, Golden also sided in favor of an amendment pushed by Republicans aimed largely at putting swing district representatives like him on the hot seat.
The GOP’s amendment called for ICE to be notified whenever undocumented immigrants barred from possessing firearms attempt to purchase one.
That amendment passed 220-209, serving to add the proposal to the overall bill that Democrats enacted shortly afterward with only a smattering of Republican support.
In seeking the amendment, U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, said anyone voting against the notification provision would be “voting to allow someone who should not have a firearm to get away with it and not be prosecuted for it.”
But a senior Democratic legislator, U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, called the amendment “a total red herring” that was not needed.
Nadler told colleagues if someone fails a background check “because he is illegally in the country, that means the system knows he is illegally in the country.”
“So what is the point of reporting him?” Nadler asked. “He has to be in the system as illegally in the country in order to fail the background check.”
Nadler said the amendment was merely a bid by the GOP “to try to mix up the immigration issue with the gun violence issue, and they really have nothing to do with each other.”
Necessary or not, the provision was included in the final version of the background checks legislation endorsed by the House.
Some activists were angry Democrats helped hand the GOP a win that bolstered ICE.
According to the The New York Times, Ocasio-Cortez “implored moderates to vote against the Republican-led motions and, in an implicit threat, added that she would make it clear to liberal activists which members supported the Republican measures.”
On Twitter, the lawmaker said she was “upset that 26 Dems forced the other 200+ to vote for a pro-ICE provision at the last min without warning” because “I think an agency that pins children down + forcibly injects them w/ antipsychotic drugs shouldn’t be given more power.”
“We can have ideological differences and that’s fine,” she said in another tweet. “But these tactics allow a small group to force the other 200+ members into actions that the majority disagree with. I don’t think that’s right, and said as much in a closed-door meeting.”
Ocasion-Cortez also mentioned “the same small splinter group of Dems” that sought to block California Democrat Nancy Pelosi from the speakership and “fund the wall during the shutdown when the public didn’t want it” had voted for the ICE amendment.
Though Ocasion-Cortez did not cite any names, Golden voted against Pelosi, favored compromise to end the shutdown and backed the controversial amendment.
Golden has repeatedly vowed to do what he thinks is best for his rural, sprawling district regardless of what Democratic leaders and activists want.
He is expected to face a tough re-election challenge in 2020, perhaps from the Republican he defeated last year, ex-U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, who served two terms before losing in a cliffhanger in the first ranked-choice voting election for a federal office.

Texto completo: Maine Rep. Jared Golden, D-2nd District, is drawing fire from his party's progressive wing for votes he made last week against more gun control and in favor of a proposal to help crack down on undocumented immigrants.
Golden's opposition to expanded background checks spurred supporters of the measure to run advertising accusing him of siding with the gun lobby, while his backing of a Republican-sponsored amendment to bolster the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raised hackles from at least one of the party's most high-profile newcomers.
Golden is among a small group of Democratic lawmakers whose votes have upset liberal firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term Democrat from New York, enough for her to speak out against them.
She said she is unhappy with a small "moderate wing," which includes Golden, because its supporters opposed California Democrat Nancy Pelosi for speaker, supported a compromise on President Trump's wall proposal and backed ICE.
Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, a group devoted to what it calls "common sense" gun regulation, has taken out at least 135 social media advertisements in the past few days on Facebook alone to go after Golden.
In its ads, the group insists the first-term lawmaker "failed us" and "sided with the gun lobby" in his opposition to background checks on most private gun transfers and for another bill to give the FBI more time to carry out the checks before a sale goes through.

Texto completo: Season 3 of Morgan Freeman's travelogue series returns on National Geographic. And the rock climbing documentary "The Dawn Wall" arrives on Netflix.
What's on TV
THE STORY OF GOD WITH MORGAN FREEMAN 9 p.m. on National Geographic. Morgan Freeman continues his international exploration of faith in this documentary series. In the first of six episodes, he sets out to understand the meaning of the devil in different traditions by picking the brain of a priest in Rome who performs exorcisms and by meeting a Buddhist lama in Nepal who discusses a Tibetan ritual meant to cleanse temples of evil.
HOARDERS 8 p.m. on A&E. If you need a reason to start spring cleaning a little early this year, look no further than the 10th season of "Hoarders." In each two-hour episode, experts help someone declutter a massive mess; in some cases, their assistance is sought to avoid crises -- financial ruin, jail time -- brought on by extreme hoarding. (The subjects in this season premiere risk losing their home if they don't do something about the 250 tons of objects they've amassed.) The episode is followed by the series premiere of 'THE TOE BRO,' about a chiropodist who can handle the most unpleasant of foot problems.
THE BACHELOR: THE WOMEN TELL ALL 8 p.m. on ABC. Twenty memorable contestants from the 23rd season of "The Bachelor" reunite for this two-hour special. The former N.F.L. player Colton Underwood confronts the women he sent home; clashes resurface among a handful of the women, and the tension subsides with a look at the season's best bloopers.
What's Streaming
THE DAWN WALL (2018) Stream on Amazon or Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play or YouTube. In "Free Solo," which won the Oscar for best feature documentary, we watch Alex Honnold become the first person to scale Yosemite's 3,000-foot-high El Capitan wall without ropes. An equally awe-inspiring feat is captured in "The Dawn Wall," a documentary on two climbers, Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson, who in 2015 completed the first ascent of El Capitan's southeastern face using only hands and feet (they had ropes to catch them if they fell, but not to help them climb)." That climb took six years of preparation and meticulous planning. Why did they do it? "I love to dream big, and I love to find ways to be a bit of an explorer," Caldwell said an interview with The New York Times. "These days it seems like everything is padded and comes with warning labels. This just lights a fire under me, and that's a really exciting way to live."
OFFICE SPACE (1999) Stream on Amazon or Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. For those who yearn for more authority at work, consider this comedy by Mike Judge a cathartic watch. Fed up with his job at a tech company, Peter (Ron Livingston) tries to get fired, but his aloof behavior earns him a promotion. When his two friends (Ajay Naidu and David Herman) are laid off instead, the three decide to seek revenge by embezzling from the company.

Democrats begin promised investigation into Trump's finances

Texto completo: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., set off a congressional race for information about President Trump's finances Monday with a request for the Trump Organization and other Trump-related entities to provide documents on financial transactions related to foreign governments, including Russia.

Several other House committees are poised to seek similar or related documents from Trump and people and entities related to him, as Democrats jockey to investigate potential conflicts of interest or financial misconduct by the president.

Nadler asked Trump’s company to provide any documents relating to possible loans, financing, or capital investment by Russia or Russian nationals and their businesses.

The Judiciary Committee also requested similar information from Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer, in particular any information he has about Trump campaign officials meeting with Russian nationals.

Rep. Elijah Cummings D-Md., the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that heard former Trump fixer Michael Cohen’s testimony last Wednesday, has also expressed interest in calling on Weisselberg to testify.

Nadler also sent a document request to the Trump Foundation, which closed late last year following several media reports and a subsequent lawsuit from New York state alleging that Trump used the foundation to illegally funnel money to himself.

“We have sent these document requests in order to begin building the public record,” Nadler said in a release announcing the document requests.

Nadler’s request includes more information on the Trump Tower Moscow project the president’s company reportedly pitched to Russian officials during the course of the 2016 campaign.

The House Financial Services, Intelligence, and Ways and Means committees are running parallel investigations into the president’s business relationships.

The Financial Services and Intelligence committees are investigating Trump’s business relationship with Deutsche Bank, a German bank that U.S. and U.K. authorities accuse of facilitating money laundering by Russian nationals and companies. In 2017 the bank agreed to an order from New York state and U.K. regulators over the charges and paid $425 million as well as set up an independent review of its anti-money laundering compliance. Deutsche Bank is also currently under investigation by German authorities for its involvement in an international money laundering scheme exposed through a leak of documents related to a Panama-based law firm, the so-called "Panama Papers."

Separately, Rep. Richard Neal D-Mass., the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, says he will use the panel's authority to demand and review tax returns of an individual or company to investigate Trump. That investigation would likely focus on whether Trump committed fraud in underreporting his income and assets for tax purposes, according to the New York Times, though it may also lead to greater scrutiny of the sources of his income. The Treasury Department has signaled it may challenge such a request in court. Efforts to make the president’s returns public, which several congressional Democrats want to do, could run into separate legal hurdles.

Democrats efforts to investigate Trump's business dealings and conflicts of interest will be time-consuming. Meanwhile federal investigators have a head start and could issue findings or file indictments before House Democrats wrap up their investigations, as Nadler acknowledged Monday.

Nadler instructed the individuals and organizations he contacted that, in some cases, they may simply provide similar information to what they’ve already provide special counsel Robert Mueller and the Southern District of New York, a U.S. attorney’s office running a separate investigation from Mueller’s.

“The Special Counsel’s office and the Southern District of New York are aware that we are taking these steps,” Nadler said in a release.

Texto completo: ProPublica has named two journalists to spearhead its expansion into visual investigations — journalism that uses video, images and audio as primary sources of information. The team will be responsible for gathering and analyzing visual evidence, and turning it into a compelling video or visual story.
Thalia Beaty has been hired as senior producer of the visual investigations team. Beaty joins ProPublica from ZigZag, a podcast about journalism, entrepreneurship and blockchain technology, where she served as producer. Prior to this role, she was a journalist at Storyful, anchoring investigations into misinformation around stories from the Parkland, Florida, shooting to the chemical attack in Douma, Syria. While at Storyful, Beaty also partnered on visual investigations with other outlets, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, verifying and sourcing footage using open-source and proprietary tools. A recent Fulbright scholar who reported from Germany on migration and asylum policy, Beaty has also worked for WNYC and Al Jazeera English.
Lucas Waldron joins the visual investigations team as a producer after working as ProPublica’s social visuals and graphics producer, innovating ProPublica’s social video across several platforms. His work for the “Documenting Hate” series — compiling video and images from social media, as well as messages from a secret neo-Nazi chatroom, to identify members of white supremacist groups who committed violence throughout the country — was recently named a finalist for the National Magazine Award for social media. Waldron has also led his own investigations, such as a co-reported piece on the troubling way that police investigate the murders of trans women.
“Over the past few years, our newsroom has recognized the growing importance of video, audio and images to identifying abuses of power,” said Claudia Milne, ProPublica senior editor, video. “Thalia and Lucas are creative thinkers with a proven track record of following visual trails of evidence to tell impactful stories across mediums, and we look forward to doing more ambitious work with them in this emerging field.”

House to query 60 Trump officials

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Declaring it's "very clear President Donald Trump obstructed justice, the chairman of the House committee in charge of impeachment says the panel is requesting documents Monday from more than 60 people from Trump's administration, family and business as part of a rapidly expanding Russia investigation.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the House Judiciary Committee wants to review documents from the Justice Department, the president's son Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Former White House chief of staff John Kelly and former White House counsel Don McGahn also are likely targets, he said.
"We are going to initiate investigations into abuses of power, into corruption and into obstruction of justice, Nadler said. "We will do everything we can to get that evidence.
Asked if he believed Trump obstructed justice, Nadler said, "Yes, I do.
Nadler isn't calling the inquiry an impeachment investigation but said House Democrats, now in the majority, are simply doing "our job to protect the rule of law after Republicans during the first two years of Trump's term were "shielding the president from any proper accountability.
"We're far from making decisions about impeachment, he said.
In a tweet on Sunday, Trump blasted anew the Russia investigation, calling it a partisan probe unfairly aimed at discrediting his win in the 2016 presidential election. "I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted & corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal & should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election! he wrote.
Nadler's comments follow a bad political week for Trump. He emerged empty-handed from a high-profile summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un on denuclearization and Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, in three days of congressional testimony, publicly characterized the president as a "con man and "cheat.
Newly empowered House Democrats are flexing their strength with blossoming investigations. A half-dozen House committees are now probing alleged coordination between Trump associates and Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election, Trump's tax returns and possible conflicts of interest involving the Trump family business and policy-making.
The House oversight committee, for instance, has set a Monday deadline for the White House to turn over documents related to security clearances after The New York Times reported that the president ordered officials to grant his son-in-law Jared Kushner's clearance over the objections of national security officials.
Nadler's added lines of inquiry also come as special counsel Robert Mueller is believed to be wrapping up his work into possible questions of Trump campaign collusion and obstruction in the Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. In his testimony, Cohen acknowledged he did not witness or know directly of collusion between Trump aides and Russia but had his "suspicions.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Sunday accused House Democrats of prejudging Trump as part of a query based purely on partisan politics.
"I think Congressman Nadler decided to impeach the president the day the president won the election, McCarthy said. "Listen to exactly what he said. He talks about impeachment before he even became chairman and then he says, you've got to persuade people to get there.' There's nothing that the president did wrong.
"Show me where the president did anything to be impeached. ... Nadler is setting the framework now that the Democrats are not to believe the Mueller report, he said.
Nadler said Sunday his committee will seek to review the Mueller report but stressed the investigation "goes far beyond collusion.
He pointed to what he considered several instances of obstruction of justice by the president, including the "1,100 times he referred to the Mueller investigation as a witch hunt' as well Trump's abrupt firing of FBI director James Comey in 2017. According to Comey, Trump had encouraged the then-FBI director to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump has denied he told Comey to end the Flynn probe.
"It's very clear that the president obstructed justice, Nadler said.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has kept calls for impeachment at bay by insisting that Mueller first must be allowed to finish his work, and present his findings publicly - though it's unclear whether the White House will allow its full release.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who chairs the House intelligence committee, on Sunday also stressed that it's too early to make judgments about impeachment.
"That is something that we will have to await Bob Mueller's report and the underlying evidence to determine. We will also have to look at the whole body of improper and criminal actions by the president including those campaign finance crimes to determine whether they rise to the level of removal from office, Schiff said.
Nadler and McCarthy spoke on ABC's "This Week, and Schiff appeared on CBS' "Face the Nation.

AT&amp;T's restructuring of WarnerMedia includes digitally stronger CNN

Resumen: Among AT&T's restructuring plans for WarnerMedia is the refashioning of CNN into a bigger digital powerhouse.

Texto completo: AT&T has officially begun transforming the former Time Warner operations into an entertainment enterprise that fits with the telecom giant's vision.
The telecom company had already incorporated the entertainment and news properties – HBO, the Warner Bros. studios, and Turner networks such as CNN and TBS – into a new entity within AT&T called WarnerMedia.
With last week's U. S. Court of Appeals denial of the DOJ's appeal of merger – and department's declaration it would no longer contest the deal – AT&T has begun to make moves to revamp the operation and merge the two companies à la Comcast and NBCUniversal.
WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey on Monday named former NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt as the new chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment. Greenblatt, who helped manage NBCUniversal after Comcast's acquisition begun in 2009, will oversee HBO and Turner's channels TNT, TBS and truTV.
His guidance will be vital to achieving Stankey's goal of increased content production at HBO. Also in Greenblatt's purview is the company's direct-to-consumer business, which will need more content for the new subscription service AT&T plans to launch later this year – one that will face the planned Disney+ streaming service as a competitor.
Also announced: CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker will now be chairman of WarnerMedia News & Sports, which includes CNN and the company's sports content.
Additionally, Kevin Tsujihara, who remains as chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. studios, will also direct a new global kids and young adults business including Cartoon Network, Adult Swim and Boomerang, and oversee Otter Media and Turner Classic Movies. And Turner International president Gerhard Zeiler has been promoted to WarnerMedia’s chief revenue officer and will handle its consolidated advertising sales efforts.
These appointments follow the departures last week of longtime HBO CEO Richard Pepler and Turner president David Levy.
Opinion: Facebook, YouTube and social media are failing society. Pull their ads until they change.
Smartphone update: MWC highlights include affordable models, not just foldable ones
Not only will there be new executive faces on board, but also new initiatives to boost CNN's digital operations. This is a key strategy for WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey, who plans to invest in product development and data analytics to increase CNN's digital delivery and engagement, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation.
CNN is already a digital leader online, hitting 120 million average monthly unique viewers in 2018, according to Comscore, 30 million ahead of Fox News and The New York Times online. But Stankey, who announced the executive appointments in a press release Monday, wants CNN's apps to better deliver customized news and content and to get its mobile consumers to spend about 10 minutes daily with CNN's apps, the Journal reported.
Using AT&T advertising technology, Stankey hopes to allow advertisers to better target viewers with relevant advertising, similar to how Facebook and Google operate, the Journal reported.
Another sign that AT&T's focused on its own services: the company is reportedly in talks with the Walt Disney Co. to sell its 10 percent stake in the streaming service Hulu, Variety reported. Disney (ABC) owns its original 30 percent stake in Hulu plus the 30 percent stake it got amid the Fox assets it paid $71 billion for last year. Comcast (NBCUniversal) owns the other 30 percent of Hulu.
“The potential deal makes sense for AT&T, which plans on launching its own streaming service in the second half of this year. We note that an actual deal could fail to materialize,” wrote CFRA Research analyst Keith Snyder in a note to investors Thursday.
He estimated the price tag for AT&T's stake as $930 million, based on Hulu's recent valuation of $9. 3 billion.

Texto completo: When Hulan Jack won the Manhattan borough president's race in 1953, newspapers across the country carried the news. It was the most powerful municipal office in the United States held by a black man -- 10 years before Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington.
While most white news outlets ran the news as a brief item, the black press celebrated it as a watershed moment -- an unquestionable sign of the African-American emergence on the political stage in the North, amid the rapid demographic change of the Great Migration and the first gains of the postwar civil rights movement.
Front pages across the country were effusive: "First in Big City History," from The Baltimore Afro-American; "N.Y. Negro Wins Top Post," in The Pittsburgh Courier; "It Happened in New York," read The Philadelphia Tribune. And "Meet Hulan E. Jack, President of the 'Capital of the World,"' exclaimed The Chicago Defender, calling him the "boss of Manhattan."
It was a job that wielded serious clout at the time -- not to mention a $25,000 salary (10 percent more than that of a United States congressman), a staff of some 1,300 and a voice in all major decisions in the city.
"He was a big shot," said Charles B. Rangel, the 88-year-old former congressman from Harlem. Though Mr. Rangel, an uptown political fixture for more than 50 years, added that Mr. Jack "has a complex legacy."
And that's why Mr. Jack rarely gets mentioned today, even during Black History Month. While his election was a landmark, many of his higher achievements were eclipsed by the elections of subsequent black mayors and the waning power of the borough president's office. In his lifetime, he was undone by remnants of old-line political machinery, a cynical version of identity politics, and the changing landscape of urban power -- in addition to his own failures of judgment and the scandals that followed.
In 1953, New York City politics were in a flux. The Irish and Italian heavies of the Tammany Hall machine -- who had run much of city politics for decades -- still held considerable sway. At the same time, Tammany and the other halls of power in the city realized the black vote was ascendant. Between the 1920 and 1950 censuses, the black population of Manhattan went from 5 percent to 20 percent. And Mr. Jack found himself one of five candidates in a field of all black men.
Among his opponents were Elmer Carter, a Republican member of the state's new Commission Against Discrimination, and Andronicus Jacobs, a longshoreman who'd fought to secure equal pay and benefits for black dock workers and ran on the American Labor Party ticket.
Born in St. Lucia, Mr. Jack immigrated to the United States as a teenager in 1923. He started out sweeping floors in a box factory while taking night classes before going on to N.Y.U. Along the way, he took an interest in politics, and began canvassing for the Democrats in Harlem.
As a dutiful Catholic and longtime party organizer, Mr. Jack was an apt choice as Tammany's candidate by 1953. He also had a distinguished record as one of the first black lawmakers from Harlem elected to the State Assembly, starting in 1940. He voted along the Tammany line. But he also emerged as a consistent and cleareyed advocate for bills aimed at dismantling segregation and discrimination in housing, education and policing. In 1945, he helped pass a bill that made New York the first state to bar race and religious discrimination in employment.
Mr. Jack's daily and long-term work in the borough office -- whether turning vacant lots into playgrounds or supporting selective slum clearance instead of wholesale demolition -- often focused on issues affecting working-class residents. He ultimately opposed Robert Moses' ill-fated expressway across Lower Manhattan, which many now agree would have irretrievably altered the city. But he also helped facilitate Mr. Moses' grand plan for Lincoln Center, insisting on a fairer timeline for relocating residents of the neighborhood.
He also kept a high profile amid national and international personalities: In photos from those years, he can be seen shoulder to shoulder with people like Mr. Moses, John F. Kennedy and Mayor Robert Wagner, and while in office he met with African leaders including the prime minister of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, and the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie. He became a symbol to the rest of the world that a black man could rise to such a station.
But the political guard was changing in Harlem, Mr. Jack's home base. He would end up scorched in a failed attempt by Tammany to unseat the charismatic but politically unpredictable Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a beloved Harlem figure, after Mr. Powell endorsed Dwight D. Eisenhower for president in 1956. Though Mr. Jack smartly declined to run against Mr. Powell, he agreed to recruit and campaign for another black challenger, whom Mr. Powell proceeded to trounce, with the help of the Harlem Democratic kingmaker J. Raymond Jones. Mr. Jack drew a hailstorm of brickbats and threats, harassed openly as an "Uncle Tom."
However, Harlem stood by Mr. Jack, at least initially, when prosecutors went after him on corruption charges in 1960 with particular tenacity, appealing a judge's dismissal of the charges and taking the case to trial before a jury deadlocked. The state retried Mr. Jack successfully -- for receiving roughly $5,000 in apartment renovations from a developer he'd been friends with for years, who was also seeking city contracts -- landing two misdemeanor convictions and a suspended sentence.
He remained active in the community and returned to Albany in a special election in 1968 -- only to be indicted in 1970 and convicted two years later in a payola conspiracy involving the local grocery-workers union. Though he insisted he was ignorant of the scheme, he served three months in federal prison, emerging a broken man.
"Hulan Jack was really a relic of a time that had past," said Hank Sheinkopf, a strategist involved in New York City politics since the 1960s. "He was in the crossfire of a political war. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. And no one remembers him because there was no sex, there was no violence."
Or as Mr. Rangel put it, more pointedly, "He got screwed. He went to Mass every morning, and Jesus left his ass holding the bag."
Mr. Jack's daughter, Julienne, now 64, remembers her father, once his political demise had begun, as dressing in a suit each morning, only to go sit alone in Central Park.
Though the offenses were too mundane and too hard to untangle to rate as anything more than a footnote in the overstuffed annals of political scandal, they were enough for Mr. Jack to be shunned in his day and forgotten soon afterward.
As his 1986 obituary in The New York Times put it, "Mr. Jack established a record as the untiring author of legislation for human rights and against racial discrimination of any type."
But unlike many of his contemporaries and successors who have parks, schools and streets named after them -- Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Percy Sutton, Shirley Chisholm, to name a few -- there is no permanent record of Mr. Jack on the map of Manhattan.
Nor, as his daughter, Julienne Jack, points out, many other places. "He's not in school curriculums," she said. "He's not in books, he's been wiped from the political rolls."

Texto completo: Michael Cohen gave public testimony under oath that contradicted past statements by President Donald Trump on WikiLeaks, Stormy Daniels and a proposed Moscow real estate deal, as well as Trump's Vietnam War deferrals and his net worth.
Here we lay out the conflicting accounts of what Trump's former personal attorney told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform at the Feb. 27 hearing, and what the president has said in the past.
WikiLeaks A key unresolved issue in the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election is whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks.
Russia intelligence services hacked into the computer network of Democratic Party officials and released the material to WikiLeaks and others "to help President-elect Trump's election chances," according to a U.S. intelligence report released in January 2017.
In his opening statement, Cohen said he was in Trump's office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, Trump's informal adviser and longtime friend, was on speaker phone talking about WikiLeaks and its plan to publicly release emails damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Cohen, Feb. 27: In July of 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump's office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with [WikiLeaks founder] Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of "wouldn't that be great."
Cohen's statement directly contradicts Trump's claim that he never spoke to Stone about WikiLeaks.
In an interview last month with the New York Times, shortly after Stone was indicted by the special counsel's office for lying to Congress, Trump had this exchange:
Maggie Haberman, Times reporter, Jan. 31: Did you ever talk to him about WikiLeaks? Because that seemed —
Trump: No.
Haberman: You never had conversations with him.
Trump: No, I didn't. I never did.
We should note that there is no evidence that Stone ever talked to Assange, although that doesn't mean that Stone didn't boast that he did. Stone, however, texted news organizationsafter Cohen's opening remarks to say: "Mr. Cohen's statement is not true."
Moscow tower The Trump Organization was actively pursuing a real estate project in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign, but the public didn't learn about it until the Washington Postbroke the story in August 2017 — about seven months into the Trump presidency.
Trump signed a letter of intent with a Moscow-based developer, I.C. Expert Investment Co., on Oct. 28, 2015. Cohen and Felix Sater, a Trump business associate, led the Trump Organization's negotiations with Russian officials until at least June 2016 — which was the same month when reports first surfaced that Russia had hacked the Democratic National Committee's servers. At the time, the Trump campaign dismissed the hack as an inside job, not the work of Russia, and Trump issued numerous statements over the next several months saying he had no business dealings in Russia.
In a July 27, 2016, interview with a CBS affiliate in Miami, Trump said, "I have nothing to do with Russia. I don't have any jobs in Russia. I'm all over the world but we're not involved in Russia." A day earlier, he tweeted he has "ZERO investments in Russia."
Even after he became president — but before the public learned about the Trump Moscow project — Trump denied having business dealings in Russia.
"I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian many years ago. I had the Miss Universe pageant — which I owned for quite a while — I had it in Moscow a long time ago. But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia," Trump said in a May 2017 interview with NBC's Lester Holt.
In the NBC interview, and throughout the campaign, the president omitted any mention of his company's pursuit of the Moscow project. That was done on purpose, Cohen testified.
Cohen told the House oversight committee that Trump "knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it."
Cohen, Feb. 27: In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there's no Russian business and then go on to lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.
Cohen continued to lie even after the Post broke the story about the Moscow project and it became public knowledge.
In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress when he told two congressional committees that the company's pursuit of the project ended in January 2016 before "the Iowa caucus and ... the very first primary." In fact, he said in his guilty plea, the Trump Organization continued negotiations into June 2016 — a month before Trump was nominated at the Republican National Convention.
Trump's net worth During the 2016 campaign, Trump boasted that he was worth $10 billion. "The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I'm very proud of the job I did," he said during an August 2015 debate.
But, as we wrote at the time, outside estimates attested to Trump's wealth, but placed the amount at between $3 billion and $4 billion.
In his testimony, Cohen said Trump "directed us to inflate his net worth and inflate his assets," providing the committee with portions of statements of financial condition for 2011 and 2013.
"It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed amongst the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes," he said.
Russian collusion In his response to Cohen's testimony, the president criticized his former lawyer for lying "about so many different things." But, he said, he was "actually impressed" that Cohen "said he saw no collusion" between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its agents during the 2016 campaign.
"I mean, he lied about so many different things, and I was actually impressed that he didn't say, 'Well, I think there was collusion for this reason or that.' He didn't say that. He said, 'No collusion,'" the president said at a press conference in Vietnam, where he was meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Cohen didn't exactly say there was "no collusion," but he did say that he didn't have any evidence of it.

Trump forgets Deepwater Horizon

Texto completo: As if Deepwater Horizon never happened.
Never mind 11 dead oil rig workers. Forget the 87 days that oil spewed unabated from a ruptured wellhead 5000 feet below the surface. Forget the 22-mile plume of oil and chemical dispersants, drifting like a toxic cloud in the Gulf of Mexico, creating incalculable damage to marine life and coast marshlands.
Well, not incalculable. Virginia Tech economists assessed the value the public placed on the various forms of marine life wiped out by the 2010 disaster and came up with $17.2 billion. That's aside from billions lost to the fishing and tourism economies. Or the $61 billion BP paid out in fines and clean-up costs and reparations for business losses.
Never mind the health consequences, including chronic respiratory difficulties, suffered by clean-up workers and residents in the coastal areas where that strange red gook washed ashore. Some 12 million pounds were removed from beaches and tidal marshes along the Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida coasts.
Yet, the Trump administration, as part of its anti-regulatory frenzy, has decided that the worst oil spill in the nation's history was not worth remembering. The Interior Department is discarding the offshore drilling rig safety regulations adopted after Deepwater Horizon to prevent another such blow-out. Meanwhile, rather than wait for the cumbersome process it takes to undo federal regs, Politico reported last week that Interior has jumped ahead and issued an extraordinary 1,679 exemptions to the safety rules.
Most of the exemptions allowed offshore drilling companies to bypass regulations that tighten the maintenance and testing requirements for the so-called "blowout preventers" that automatically cap a wellhead in case of a rupture. Of course, the blowout preventer on Deepwater Horizon failed spectacularly.
It's as if the disastrous aftermath hardly matters as the Trump administration erases regulations that fossil fuel operations find burdensome. Oil drillers want offshore drilling rules relaxed and Trump's appointees are there to serve.
Regulation rollbacks have become the very essence of the Trump administration, almost by default after stumbling with other big initiatives, like the construction of his fabled wall or the nuclear disarmament of North Korea. According to the New York Times, the administration has targeted 78 environmental rules created to protect drinking water, control toxic industrial emissions, limit greenhouse gases and protect endangered species.
Trumps' fevered anti-environmentalists have attacked regs governing the disposal of coal ash waste. And the arsenic, lead, mercury, selenium, chromium and cadmium that steam power plants spew into the atmosphere. They've stopped enforcing the prohibition against using hydrofluorocarbons (a particularly potent greenhouse gas) in air-conditioners and refrigerators. They've undone rules that required states to monitor tailpipe exhaust emissions and oil refinery pollution.
Ironically, much of the environmental degradation fomented by Trump anti-regulatory regime will be borne by Trump country. For example, coastal Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle - the very areas most at risk for another Deepwater Horizon - encompass some of Trump's most fervent supporters.
It's not the residents of liberal Broward County or Boston or New York or Los Angeles who need to worry about an unregulated coal ash pond next door or their children breathing in polluted air from a nearby chemical plant or strip miners spoiling the water. It's not our workers who'll be descending into coal mines or onto oil rigs where safety precautions are no longer a priority for federal inspectors.
Not that the regulation rollbacks aren't painful hereabouts. South Florida was ground zero in the shameless for-profit college scandals that left thousands of would-be students with second-rate educations, deep in debt, facing dismal employment prospects. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has undone safeguards designed to protect students from the misleading and unscrupulous tactics employed by for-profits.
South Florida also has more than its share of endangered species, another genre that the Trump administration considers subsidiary to the wants of corporate America. And the Trump administration's pretense that global warming and rising seas are liberal myths will surely leave us treading water.
Of course, coastal communities in Trump-loving South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas and Alabama also face inundation. But folks in those places simply pretend otherwise. And they shrug off the EPA's own findings that cessation of the pollution rules for power plants will lead to 11,000 premature deaths, 4,700 heart attacks, 2,800 new cases of chronic bronchitis, and 130,000 asthma attacks every year.
And if Trump's supporters, between coughing fits, can pretend that Deepwater Horizon never happened, then why would they ever think to burden offshore drillers with inconvenient safety regs.

Texto completo: TUNIS, Tunisia -- Two years ago, American Marines battled Al Qaeda militants in western Tunisia along the border with Algeria. A Marine and a Tunisian soldier were wounded and two other Marines were later commended for their valor in the gunfight.
Yet many details of the February 2017 clash remain murky, largely because of the Tunisian government's political sensitivities over the presence of American forces on their territory.
Publicly, American officials will say only that the battle happened in a North African "host" country. The Tunisian authorities have refused to confirm that anything happened at all.
Last year, when one of the most detailed accounts of the clash to date surfaced in a report in Task & Purpose, a privately owned American website focused on military and veterans affairs, the Tunisian Ministry of Defense was dismissive. It said the "presence of American troops in Tunisia was only for cooperation and training, not conducting operations."
But in fact, the United States and Tunisia have quietly expanded and deepened their security and counterterrorism ties over the past several years, with some 150 Americans training and advising their Tunisian counterparts in one of largest missions of its kind on the African continent, according to American officials.
And the 2017 clash, confirmed by an American official and an American security expert, was a stark example of the risks American forces face in trying to help their North African allies battle Qaeda-linked groups.
The deepening American involvement in an array of secret missions goes largely unreported because of Tunisian and American concerns that publicizing this could attract even more extremist violence. There is also a strong aversion across the political spectrum in North Africa to Western intervention in the region.
Still the growing cooperation is notable because it comes at a time when the Pentagon is reducing its presence elsewhere on the continent, especially in West Africa, as the military shifts to focus more attention on challenges elsewhere from Russia and China.
"Tunisia is one of our most capable and willing partners," Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the head of the Pentagon's Africa Command, told Congress in February.
Among the 150 Americans operating in Tunisia is a contingent of Marine Corps Special Operations forces who were involved in the 2017 gun battle.
Unarmed American surveillance drones fly reconnaissance missions from Tunisia's main air base outside Bizerte, the northernmost city in Africa, hunting terrorists who might be seeking to infiltrate through the country's border with Libya and other areas, American military officials said.
The United States had sought permission to fly from bases farther south, where weather conditions are better. But the Tunisians wanted the American presence to be more concealed, officials said.
There are other signs of Washington's increasing security cooperation with Tunisia. Body armor, rifles and night-vision goggles; reconnaissance aircraft and fast patrol boats; radios and devices to counter improvised explosives: The value of American military supplies delivered to the country increased to $119 million in 2017 from $12 million in 2012, government data show.
Tunisia was the birthplace of the Arab Spring uprisings and is widely seen as the lone success story among countries that were swept up in the revolts. It emerged with a democratic system and a free society after the 2011 overthrow of its authoritarian president of 23 years, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
Yet it has struggled to control a threat from Al Qaeda and other radical groups, which have exploited the new freedoms to radicalize followers and establish networks of cells across Tunisia.
The problem first became apparent in 2012 with an attack on the American Embassy in the capital, Tunis. Three days earlier in neighboring Libya, militants had attacked the American Consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi. Four Americans were killed, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.
Riots in Tunis and two political assassinations by a Qaeda-linked group, Ansar al-Sharia, followed in 2013. The same year, an insurgency by Al Qaeda's North African branch began to target the military in the mountains of the Kasserine region near the Algerian border, the area where the 2017 gunfight would later erupt.
Attacks on the police escalated around the country. Then in 2015, there were two massacres of foreign tourists that captured international attention -- one at a museum in Tunis and the other at the beach resort of Sousse on the Mediterranean.
In the National Bardo Museum attack on March 18, two attackers killed 22 people, mostly tourists. Four months later, the shooting on a beach and inside a hotel in Sousse killed 39.
In March 2016, jihadists mounted an assault from Libya on police and military posts in the border town of Ben Gardane, which Tunisian forces successfully countered.
Tunisia has succeeded in dismantling most of the militant networks since 2015, according to government officials, diplomats and security analysts. But it still faces threats.
Last month, a civilian was recently beheaded and mines were planted near his body. Soldiers were wounded in a separate mine blast, according to the Ministry of Defense.
"The jihadist cells have completely given up the playbook of gaining the sympathy of the population," said Matt Herbert, a director of Maharbal, a Tunisian strategic consulting firm. Now, he said, they are trying to terrorize them.
In October last year, a suicide attack on Avenue Habib Bourguiba, the main street in downtown Tunis, wounded 20 people. The only person who died was the bomber -- a woman identified as Mouna Guebla who was not on the authorities' radar.
But a suicide attack in the capital set off alarm bells for the government because it came after three years of hard work and costly security investment against the terrorist networks.
Prime Minister Youssef Chahed supports the fight against terrorism. The government spends 15 percent of its budget on the defense and interior ministries for that purpose, he said recently. But he acknowledged that this has come at a cost for other pressing problems, such as poverty and unemployment.
Officials point to improvements in logistics and operations in the fight against terrorism. But the country is still struggling with its porous borders with Libya and Algeria, which serve as transit areas for Al Qaeda's branch in North Africa and as well as the remains of Islamic State cells in Libya.
The 2017 clash involving the Marines was a reminder of the resilience of the jihadists, even amid the combined American-Tunisian efforts. In the Kasserine mountain area, only a few dozen guerrillas are active at any given time. Yet because of its proximity to the Algerian border, the Tunisian army has struggled to secure it.
The team of Marines was on a three-day mission with Tunisian forces when it got into a "fierce fight against members of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb," according to one of the award citations for the Marines, who were not identified. Although the Marines were said to be on a "train, advise and assist" mission, the citations made clear that they were fighting and, at times, directing events.
The United States command withheld the details of the clash for "classification considerations, force protection, and diplomatic sensitivities," according to the report by Task & Purpose, which obtained the citations, with some details redacted, through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The award citation indicates that the Tunisian forces killed one Qaeda operative in the initial gunfight, but that the unit then came under accurate fire from the rear as the insurgents tried to outflank them and a Marine was wounded.
One Marine was commended for tending to his wounded comrade while under fire and winching him to a hovering helicopter. A second was commended for coordinating air support from the helicopter and taking over behind the machine gun when the Tunisian gunner was wounded.
In an interview with The New York Times in December, Kamel Akrout, a national security adviser to the Tunisian president, was asked about what had happened that day in the mountains of Kasserine. He would neither confirm nor deny the incident.
"We have an intense cooperation with the Americans, but also with other countries," he said. "Although I can assure you that no Tunisian soldier would accept a foreign soldier fighting on their behalf. They are not with us during operations."

Texto completo: Prosecutors may be looking into Assange's release of military logs
Chelsea Manning has been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury in the investigation of Julian Assange, officials said, one of several indicators that prosecutors remain interested in WikiLeaks' publication of diplomatic cables and military war logs in 2010.
Prosecutors in Virginia have been pursuing a case based on conduct that predates WikiLeaks' publication of hacked emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, and it's not clear investigators are interested in that activity. Officials discussed the investigation of Assange, who founded WikiLeaks, on the condition of anonymity because of the secrecy of the grand jury process.
Manning, whose subpoena was first reported by the New York Times, is a former Army private who served seven years in a military prison for passing secret State Department cables and military documents to WikiLeaks before rece iving a commutation from President Barack Obama.
Manning's attorneys have filed a motion to quash the subpoena.
"I object strenuously to this subpoena, and to the grand jury process in general," Manning said in a statement. "We've seen this power abused countless times to target political speech. I have nothing to contribute to this case and I resent being forced to endanger myself by participating in this predatory practice."
The subpoena was signed last month by Gordon Kromberg, a national security prosecutor on the Assange case. Kromberg last month persuaded a judge to leave sealed an indictment against Assange despite its inadvertent exposure in an unrelated court filing last year.
Under Obama, Justice Department officials had decided not to pursue charges against Assange and WikiLeaks after concluding that to do so could set a precedent that paved the way for prosecuting news organizations for publishing classified information. But the case got a fresh look under President Trump.
Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said the Justice Department likely indicted Assange last year to stay within the 10-year statute of limitations on unlawful possession or publication of national defense information, and is now working to add charges. "There's nothing else that would make sense," he said.
"The heart of the controversy is, there's never been a successful prosecution" for publishing classified information, Vladeck said. "There has always been the specter of a First Amendment defense."
Peter Zeidenberg, a national security defense attorney, said he cannot see grounds for Manning to refuse the subpoena. "She's already been prosecuted, she's been convicted, she served a sentence," he said. "She has no Fifth Amendment privilege over self-incrimination. If she doesn't testify than she'll be held in contempt."
Manning appears to be the latest individual subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury investigating Assange in the Eastern District of Virginia.
Last July, computer expert David House, who befriended Manning in 2010 at a hacker space in Boston he founded, testified for 90 minutes before the grand jury. In an interview, House said he met the WikiLeaks founder in January 2011 while Assange was under house arrest at Ellingham Hall, a manor house 120 miles northeast of London. Assange was fighting an extradition request by Sweden, where he faced an inquiry into allegations of sexual assault.
Assange asked House to help run political operations for WikiLeaks in the United States. "Specifically, he wanted me to help achieve favorable press for Chelsea Manning," he said.
House, who testified in exchange for immunity, said the grand jury was interested in his relationship with Assange. "They wanted full insight into WikiLeaks, what its goals were and why I was associated with it," he said. "They wanted explanations of why certain things occurred and how they occurred. . . . It was all related to disclosures around the war logs."
The grand jury seemed interested in whether Assange had solicited Manning to hack on WikiLeaks' behalf, but did not press "very hard" on that, he said. He was not asked about WikiLeaks' 2016 release of Democratic emails, which U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed were hacked by Russians. Nor did he have personal knowledge of that, he said.
He was never told what charges prosecutors were contemplating.
House said his last contact with Assange was in 2013 and his last contact with WikiLeaks was in 2015.
House said he fears retribution for being associated with WikiLeaks and Manning in 2010 and does not believe the U.S. prosecution is warranted.
"This is not an investigation borne out of a concern for national security," he said. "It is an investigation borne out of retribution and revenge against Mr. Assange over the [2010] leak that he precipitated, and how this leak impacted the careers of politicians in Washington, D.C."
Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a onetime WikiLeaks spokesman who has grown estranged from Assange, said in an interview he was contacted by the German federal police in October 2017 and told that U.S. authorities wished to talk to him "about the Manning-Julian connection." He also received a March 2018 letter repeating the request from then-U. S. attorney in the Eastern District, Dana Boente.
He said the German police told him the FBI was interested in "what possible contact - possible coordination'' occurred between Assange and Manning, he said. The Americans appeared to be interested in "possible solicitation" by Assange of Manning, he said.
Domscheit-Berg told the German police he was not interested in speaking to the FBI.

Texto completo: Wash. governor focusing 2020 bid on 'most urgent challenge of our time'
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Friday became the latest Democrat to launch a 2020 presidential bid, asserting that he is the only candidate who will make combating climate change the nation's top priority.
"Whether we shrink to this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time," Inslee said at an event staged at a solar installation company in Seattle. "We have one chance to defeat climate change, and it is right now. It is my belief when you have one chance in life, you take it."
As he did in a video released earlier in the day announcing his candidacy, Inslee made it clear that his bid would be built largely around a single issue that he called "the most urgent challenge of our time."
In his remarks, Inslee argued that fighting climate change is central to progress on an array of other fronts, including health care, national security and racial justice.
Minorities, he said, are disproportionately affected by climate change in part because they are more likely to live near pollution-spewing plants.
"I am running for president because, unlike the man in the White House, I believe in all the people who make up America," Inslee said in one of several barbs directed at President Trump.
Inslee, 68, is the first governor to enter the crowded Democratic contest and has the longest political résumé of anyone in the race.
In 1992, after two terms as a state legislator, he was elected to represent a largely rural, Republican-leaning congressional district in central Washington. In Congress, Inslee attracted national attention by voting for the 1994 assault-weapons ban, immediately making him a target for the GOP.
"People are fed up with crime and want something done to protect them and their children from violence," Inslee told reporters at the time, standing by his vote.
Inslee lost in that year's Republican wave, but he mounted a comeback, winning in a neighboring district four years later. One of the most potent attack ads run against him portrayed a fictional call from President Bill Clinton, thanking Inslee for being so loyal; in 1998, Inslee ran his own version of that ad, with a Newt Gingrich impersonator thanking the Republican incumbent for helping him impeach the president.
Back in Congress, Inslee was a reliable liberal vote and a member of the center-left New Democrats. He focused mostly on climate and environmental issues; in 2007 he published "Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy," a book about ways to transition the country from dependence on fossil fuels to renewable energy.
He also kept one eye on Washington, running for governor in 2012 and winning a narrow victory over a popular Republican attorney general. Inslee spent his first term presiding over a divided state government, cutting budget deals with a Republican state Senate and instating a moratorium on the state's death penalty.
Inslee was comfortably reelected in 2016 and joined the loud resistance to Trump, bringing the state into lawsuits to stop a ban on refugees and immigrants from some Muslim-majority countries. But Inslee's time in Olympia entered a new phase in 2018, after a special Senate election gave Democrats full control of the state government.
"It will be a bell in the night, showing hope for the country," Inslee told the New York Times on the eve of that election.
The governor made good on that bravado, reviving a number of ambitious bills that Republicans had blocked and capping it all with a push for a carbon tax.
During his remarks in Seattle on Friday, Inslee cited a number of his accomplishments and suggested they should be replicated on the national level, including raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, abolishing the death penalty and legalizing marijuana.
"It's about time we do it nationwide," he said of the latter measure.
Inslee will have to overcome a few major hurdles as he begins his run. Despite spending more than two decades in elected office in Washington state, he lacks the national name recognition of several of his would-be opponents.
And despite his calls for drastic action to combat climate change, Inslee's most ambitious climate initiative - the institution of a tax on carbon emissions - was voted down in the state's November elections amid massive opposition spending from oil companies.
In response, Inslee introduced a new batch of legislation, calling it "a clean energy smart deal," that he says would stop the state's utilities from relying on fossil-fuel power by 2045.
During his remarks Friday, Inslee decried the influence of fossil-fuel industries on politics and vowed that if he is elected president, "that gravy train is over."
To capture the nomination, Inslee would also have to overcome some tension within his party in one of the earliest-voting states.
Inslee was chairman of the Democratic Governors Association in 2018, and New Hampshire Democrats felt that he did not direct enough support to their gubernatorial candidate, Molly Kelly, who lost to incumbent Republican Chris Sununu.
In an interview with a local radio station, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said Inslee "abandoned" the state in the 2018 election.

Texto completo: Should we go to the Pinegrove show? There's no good answer at the end of this story, and there's no good answer at the end of this line, which stretches down the ashen concrete sidewalk outside the Black Cat on 14th Street NW on a recent Thursday night - hundreds of Pinegrove fans literally waiting around in a gray area.
It's been 15 months since the intrepid New Jersey indie troupe went silent, after Pinegrove bandleader Evan Stephens Hall posted on Facebook in November 2017 that he had been "accused of sexual coercion" by a woman he had been in a relationship with. Hall's statement was both murky and long-winded, but he accepted responsibility for his actions - even though it remains unclear what those actions were. In respect to his alleged victim's wishes, Hall put the band on hold for a year and started therapy. Then, in September, Pitchfork ran a deep and intimately reported profile of the band that aimed to account for the staggering complexity of Pinegrove's imminent return.
Illuminating as the story was, it still left fans stranded in a glowing fog - and with decisions to make. Stick with this band? Buy a concert ticket? Walk through that door and get your hand stamped? Buy a T-shirt? Sing along?
Talk to more than two dozen Pinegrove fans queued up outside of the Black Cat and you'll find them mulling these questions with great nuance. And yet, the same words keep popping up. Many say they were "confused" by Hall's original Facebook post, mainly because it was so "vague," but that the Pitchfork story was "clarifying," and that Hall's return might be the "right way" for public figures implicated in the #MeToo movement to try to rehabilitate themselves - " maybe ."
Before the club opens its doors, you can almost see the question marks floating over the sidewalk. "I'm very involved in sexual assault awareness at my school," says Rebekah Boggs, 20, a student at the University of Virginia. "So it's definitely an uncomfortable position to be in as a fan. . . . I don't really know how to feel. I'm still uncomfortable telling my friends, 'I'm going to the Pinegrove concert.' "
Some of those friends have "canceled" Pinegrove, exercising their right to excommunicate a public figure for unconscionable behavior - at least in digital space, where public opinion frequently obeys a tidy binary of "cancel" or "condone." But out here on 14th Street, where real fans are trying to establish a real sense of resolution in real time, it's much cloudier.
"I definitely feel that in a lot of situations, cancel culture doesn't help anyone, that it's a reductive and regressive way of addressing societal ills," says Nicholas Kohomban, 23, down from Brooklyn for the show. "Especially in Evan's situation, here's someone being very open, and honest, and vulnerable, and admitting that they probably did something wrong, and inviting criticism." (In the Pitchfork article, Hall said, "We don't want listeners who are like, 'We don't care about this sort of thing.' ") Kohomban adds, "So he's not Ryan Adams, right?"
As far as we can tell, Hall is not Ryan Adams. Ryan Adams, that famously petulant songwriter who was recently exposed in the New York Times for his alleged transgressions against women. Ryan Adams, who, according to the Times report, sent explicit texts to a teenage fan who thought the guy on the other end might help her achieve her own rock-and-roll dreams. Ryan Adams, a star who got away with all kinds of ugly behavior for nearly two decades, just because enough people still believe the old myth of rock genius - that is, an artist's temper and aggression are byproducts of their eccentricity and zeal (but only when that artist is a man).
In the days after the Times' report, distributors shelved Adams's forthcoming album, radio stations yanked his songs from the air, and the FBI launched an inquiry into his relationship with that young fan. But let's see how he's doing a year from now.
Meanwhile, as the world watched Adams squirm out of owning his alleged misdeeds on Twitter, Pinegrove's more devout fans say they've seen Hall "doing the right thing" over the past year. He didn't dismiss the accusation. He accepted responsibility, publicly and completely. He followed his alleged accuser's wishes while respecting her anonymity. He sought help. Now, Pinegrove fans want to feel like they're doing the right thing, too - which means showing up to the club with all of their skepticism and whatever's left of their enthusiasm.
"Cancel culture can be very toxic when the situation is hazy. So I didn't want to come to any assumptions, and it's been very difficult to come to terms with his [Facebook] statement," says Alyssa Dahle, 21, of Ellicott City. "In terms of what actually happened, nobody knows. And we won't know."
Dahle's co-worker, Jake Quimby, 28, of Baltimore seems almost painfully vexed. "I don't think it's forgiven by any means, or forgotten, and I don't think it'll get any clearer," he says. "But we're here."
And once we're all inside, Pinegrove takes the stage, almost cautiously, slowly setting that metaphorical gray-fog aglow with music. These songs feel as delicate as rock songs can, with old lyrics that now mean new things. For instance, on "Rings" - composed and recorded before Hall was accused - the frontman delivers a line about self-exposure that feels as if it had been written for the audience now assembled before him: "I trust you so much."
Between numbers, Hall thanks the crowd in a silence-filling kind of way, but he still radiates sincerity in the right amounts. He doesn't want to look needy or solicitous. He doesn't want to look overconfident or glib. He's trying to do everything right. He thanks the volunteers who hosted a bystander intervention harassment training before the show. He thanks his cousin, and his aunt and his mom, all of whom are in the audience. He says nothing about remorse, or loyalty, or contrition, or healing - but he does thank everyone in the building for "being so kind to us and so kind to each other."
Hall isn't trying to change your mind, but the music might be. A good Pinegrove song teases out the confessional commonalities between emo and country music to do something mysteriously empathetic. It's the kind of music that can make you feel like it hears you .
And when it's billowing off the stage like this, it becomes nearly impossible to drag your brain back out to the sidewalk, back to those hours leading up to the show where you were thinking about all of the unknowns, all of the missing pieces in this story, the anonymous accuser that we'll never know, all of the absences. But try to imagine the absent. Imagine everyone who made different decisions and stayed home. Now, imagine if they could hear everyone here singing along. Does it sound like anything other than forgiveness?

Texto completo: As more former aides shared stories of sometimes-abusive behavior, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar vowed Friday to improve relations with her staffers.
The Minnesota presidential candidate is trying to rise from a large field of competitors as stories about her treatment of employees long shared privately among Democratic operatives and insiders are spilling into the open. Former employees of her Senate office and previous political campaigns have anonymously described to BuzzFeed, the New York Times and now the Star Tribune, many examples of behavior by Klobuchar they considered abusive, bullying and demeaning.
"I'm incredibly proud of the work our staff has done and I would not be here without amazing staff," Klobuchar said in a statement to the Star Tribune. "I know I can be tough, I know I can push people too hard, and I also know I can do better -- and I will."
Klobuchar did not grant an
interview for this story.
Among veterans of Klobuchar's employ, even those who defend her acknowledge an intense work environment.
"A lot of what's been said about working for Amy is true," said Zach Rodvold, who worked on Klobuchar's first U.S. Senate campaign in 2006 and ran her Minnesota office from June 2007 to September 2009. "I just don't see it as something that's disqualifying for running for president."
Rodvold, now district chief of staff to Rep. Dean Phillips, said he saw Klobuchar lose her temper, remembers her once throwing a pen in frustration, and said her expectations were at times unreasonably high. But he said she could also be funny, charming and charismatic, and that in his estimation she worked harder than anyone on her staff. Last month, Rodvold brought his family to Klobuchar's presidential campaign kickoff in Minneapolis.
"The best way I can describe it is sort of like Navy SEALs training. It's not intended to be fun. It's hard. But what you get from it is you become very, very good at what you do," Rodvold said. Like a number of Klobuchar's defenders, Rodvold said he thinks views of Klobuchar's leadership style are influenced by different standards for male and female bosses.
The Star Tribune interviewed four former Klobuchar staffers who all said her treatment of subordinates regularly went beyond what they considered acceptable even for a tough, demanding boss. They described similar kinds of behavior: Frequent angry outbursts over minor issues, regular criticisms and admonitions in front of others, office supplies or papers thrown in anger, cutting remarks and insults on a nearly constant basis, waking up to long strings of e-mails from Klobuchar sent late at night or in the early morning.
All shared those observations on the condition they not be named in this story, for fear of reprisal.
"You'd wake up to a string of four, five, six, seven, eight e-mails of increasing anger, with everybody copied," said one. "It was, 'This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Naive. Stupid. Awful.' It was just this vitriol. You didn't wake up to it every single day, but it was enough that my stomach just clenched every morning the second I woke up."
Another former staffer also described frequent late-night or early-morning e-mails from Klobuchar when she was upset about something: "Very personal attacks day after day. How long can you be called an idiot before you believe it?"
One of the former staffers, a woman, was angered by defenses of Klobuchar on feminist grounds. The source said she didn't think feminism excused bullying.
Two of the former staffers described an office constantly on edge, with senior employees usually either containing or anticipating Klobuchar's anger. One said Klobuchar was hardest on her top staffers and usually nicer to junior staffers and interns. Turnover was rapid; the website LegiStorm, a Congress-focused research group, currently ranks Klobuchar's office turnover as third highest in the U.S. Senate.
Klobuchar has pointed out that a number of her closest aides have worked for her for long periods of time. Many went on to important jobs in the Obama administration, other congressional offices and political operations, top law firms and major corporations around the country. Top staffers in U.S. Senate offices can make into the low six figures, with less senior or high-ranking staffers earning in the upper five figures.
Many politicians at high levels, men and women both, are privately known to be very hard to work for. Horror stories about working for Klobuchar have long circulated in political and media circles in Washington and Minnesota. The reluctance of former staffers with firsthand experience to identify themselves kept the stories out of the public eye, but the glaring scrutiny of a presidential campaign changed that.
To date, all of Klobuchar's most critical former staffers in this and other stories have remained anonymous.
Published stories about Klobuchar's alleged mistreatment of employees both preceded and followed her entry into the contest for the Democratic nomination. It was an otherwise successful rollout: a snowy announcement along the Mississippi River garnered a wave of largely favorable national press, with Klobuchar winning praise from many early-state Democrats, pundits and even some Republicans for her pragmatic tone, results-driven approach, gregarious style with voters and track record of electability.
Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, who will weigh in first as the nominating contest gets going early next year, have been reading and circulating the coverage of Klobuchar's treatment of employees.
"If not for that cloud, I think she would have a really great shot at Iowa. She may yet," said Pat Rynard, a former Democratic campaign operative who now runs the Iowa Starting Line website, which covers the Iowa caucus.
Mike Lewis, an attorney in Concord, N.H., co-hosted a recent house party for Klobuchar. He said she's currently among his top choices, and he said he's wary of anonymous allegations about a Democratic contender in the approach to an election many see as vitally important to the country's future.
"In an era of disinformation, people are going to wait to hear more and assess," Lewis said.
Last weekend, 66 former Klobuchar staffers from her time in the Senate and her previous tenure as Hennepin County attorney signed a letter posted on the website Medium that said positive anecdotes about Klobuchar as a boss had been neglected in the recent coverage.
"I wouldn't say she was abusive at all. She generally is a nice, kind, caring woman who wants to do well," said Christi Mayer, who worked two jobs in Klobuchar's D.C. office in 2007-08, director of scheduling and director of administration. "She's tough. And I don't see anything wrong with that."
Before she worked for Klobuchar, Mayer worked several years for a four-star Army general, Gen. Barry McCaffrey. After she left Klobuchar's office, she worked for a time for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, another Democratic presidential candidate, whose office Mayer said was similarly rigorous.
"I worked for tougher people," Mayer said.
Deb Calvert worked as Klobuchar's state scheduler for four years. While it was "a very hard job," she said the expectations reflected the senator's own personal work ethic. She said Klobuchar was very loyal and dedicated to her staff, in her experience.
None of these sources denied that working for Klobuchar was often tough and draining, and they stressed they did not mean to discount the experiences of others.
Mychal Vlatkovich, who worked two stints as Klobuchar's Minnesota-based press secretary, said she taught him to function in an intense, high-pressure environment.
Vlatkovich is now communications director to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. Of his time with Klobuchar, he said: "I did feel gratitude -- you talk about accelerating your career, I couldn't have jump-started it any better than I did under her management."

DEMOCRATS WANT DETAILS OF TOP SECURITY CLEARANCES

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A powerful Democratic House committee chairman investigating possible abuses of the government's security clearance process stepped up demands on Friday to see key documents and interview potential witnesses from the White House in light of a report that President Donald Trump personally intervened to grant his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a top-secret clearance despite legal and national security concerns.
Mr. Kushner received the security clearance despite concerns from intelligence and White House officials about his contacts with foreign individuals and his failure to disclose them on his clearance application. Both of those factors ordinarily would all but guarantee that an applicant not be given access to government secrets.
News reports said that Mr. Trump's intervention so concerned senior administration officials that John F. Kelly, then the White House chief of staff, documented the action in a contemporaneous internal memo that said he had been "ordered" to grant Mr. Kushner a top-secret clearance.
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who leads the House Oversight and Reform Committee, accused the White House in a letter Friday of stonewalling his requests for information and implied that if it did not comply voluntarily, he would issue a subpoena.
He said the report, published by The New York Times, added new concerns that Mr. Trump was not honest to the public about his role in the clearance process and broader questions about irregularities surrounding who should have access to sensitive government secrets.
The Times also reported that Donald F. McGahn II, then the White House counsel, wrote a memo of his own documenting concerns raised by the CIA and other officials about Mr. Kushner. Mr. McGahn, the memo noted, had recommended against giving him such broad access to the government's secrets.
Mr. Trump told The Times in January that he had no role in Mr. Kushner's clearance.
Mr. Cummings has been pursuing reported irregularities since 2017, when Republicans were in control of the House. He started a broad inquiry last month after taking control of the panel, Congress's most muscular investigative body.
"If true, these new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation's most sensitive secrets," Mr. Cummings wrote in a letter to Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel. The letter went on to ask about "why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this Committee."
House investigators are demanding that the White House turn over documents related to security clearances of top officials by Monday.
Mr. Cummings has also asked for documents related to a review of the security clearance process that Mr. Kelly conducted in 2018 that concluded there were serious flaws in the system.

New York leaders ask Amazon to reconsider

Texto completo: Cuomo, de Blasio hope the effort will make other businesses feel welcome
Dozens of business and civic leaders are making a last-ditch effort to persuade Amazon and its founder and chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, to reconsider its decision to back out of its plans to bring 25,000 jobs to New York City.
More than 70 area leaders, led by the chief executives of Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, JetBlue and MasterCard, urged the online retailer to reconsider its decision in a letter published Friday in a full-page advertisement in the New York Times.
"We know that the public debate that followed the announcement of the Long Island City project was rough and not very welcoming," they wrote. "Opinions are strong in New York - sometimes strident. We consider it part of the New York charm! But when we commit to a project as important as this, we figure out how to get it done in a way that works for everyone."
The appeal aligns with efforts by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) to try to talk the company into returning to negotiations, including by placing a call to Bezos, according to the Times. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) As of Friday, though, the company has "given no indication" it would reconsider, the governor said.
The letter was meant to tell other businesses that New York's economic climate is beneficial for them, Cuomo said in a radio interview with WNYC's "The Brian Lehrer Show." "That was petty politics that governed the day," he said of the deal's collapse. "It was a mistake, it was a blunder. We want business, we're open for business."
The head of the Partnership For New York City, the business group that organized the joint letter, said the letter also was meant to assure the technology industry as a whole that the city was eager to attract investment.
"This isn't just about Amazon," said Kathryn Wylde, the partnership's president and CEO. "The treatment [of Amazon] is a black spot on our record in terms of our hope to continue to be a global commercial capital, specifically for the technology industry. We've gotten feedback from firms that have a presence on the West Coast. They've said the treatment that Amazon received, and their decision that it wasn't worth it, was pretty shocking and caused other firms and entrepreneurs to question whether it was worth it to take on New York."
Amazon representatives declined to comment.
Amazon canceled the project and its 25,000 jobs two weeks ago amid an uproar over the company's potential effect on the city and the $3 billion in state and local incentives promised to it by Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio (D). Amazon is moving ahead with plans to bring 25,000 to 37,000 jobs to the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington County, in Northern Virginia, and says it will spread jobs that had been planned for New York around other company hubs.
Besides dozens of tech, banking and real estate executives in New York, elected officials including Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (D), Carolyn B. Maloney (D) and Max Rose (D) and religious, education and nonprofit leaders signed the letter asking Amazon to reconsider.
But opponents of the deal, who succeeded in turning away Amazon in the first place, remain undeterred, as 77 leaders from labor unions, advocacy groups and nonprofit organizations quickly responded that they were not backing down. They still wanted to see economic growth in New York, the advocates argued, but not without first considering the effect on housing prices and racial and economic equality.
Like other big-city tech hubs, housing costs in New York have risen dramatically in recent years as Apple, Google and other Internet giants have expanded.
"Rather than pursuing economic development policies that lead to displacement, we demand policies that create housing stability and security. We call for Universal Rent Control that gives people, not the real estate industry, the power to determine where they live - no New Yorker should live in fear of a rapid rent increase or an eviction," they wrote.
Of Amazon, the group added: "We defeated them recently, and we will do it again."
The office of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D), who was sharply critical of the deal New York agreed to with Amazon, issued a statement to The Post saying: "If the elected officials spent half as much time talking to the community as they do Jeff Bezos, we might have come to an agreement."
A key critic of New York's Amazon deal said he saw no weakening of opposition that might encourage the company to come back.
"Nothing has changed in the last two weeks," said state Sen. Michael N. Gianaris (D-Queens). "It's the same people saying they support it who supported it before, and the same people saying they have concerns."

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - It was a rare sight, even after 18 years of progress in Afghanistan: more than 700 women from across the country, gathered to send an unequivocal message to the men now negotiating with the Taliban.
We want peace, the women said, but not at the cost of our rights.
The conference in Kabul, six months in the making, represented a watershed moment at a time when Afghans are struggling to comprehend what peace with the Taliban would bring, even as the war with the militant group is as deadly as ever. U.S. diplomats are holding talks with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, but the Afghan government is not involved.
Several women expressed fears that a peace deal could bring the Taliban back into the government, leaving women and girls vulnerable to a new wave of the sort of edicts that constrained their lives until the group's overthrow in 2001. Women were routinely beaten for violating Taliban codes.
One woman at the conference, held inside an enormous tentlike structure, spoke sharply to President Ashraf Ghani shortly before he delivered a speech emphasizing his support for women's rights.
"You should put killers in prison, not make peace with them," said the woman, Nargiss Qurbani, 48, who said the Taliban killed her husband in 1997 and later wounded her son, a soldier.
Ghani did not respond.
The hundreds of women who attended came mostly from urban areas in 34 provinces. Most wore makeup, a superfluous embellishment when the Taliban barred women from showing their face. Many covered their hair with scarves, but a few left theirs defiantly uncovered.
Exactly one wore a burqa - the all-encompassing garment that women were once required to wear by the Taliban.
Rula Ghani, Afghanistan's first lady, urged women to take advantage of the gathering to express their views publicly.
"Afghan women have their own voice, and now they're raising it," Rula Ghani said.
Her husband, in his speech, did not directly address the issue of women's rights under any new government that could arise from a peace agreement.
"You have been pushed aside, but today that has changed," Ashraf Ghani told the women. "You are not a victim any more. You are making the future."
The president's speech was warmly received, but several women said in interviews that they wanted ironclad guarantees that women's rights would be protected as part of any peace agreement.
"We want peace, but we don't want to lose our achievements," said Aqilla Mustafavi, 25. "We took a long road to reach here, and we don't want to go back. - (The New York Times)

READING FEST: Cat astronauts, 'Last Romantics' and more

Texto completo: Drew Brockington only recently blasted off into the wide world of reading festivals. But he's quickly learned that everyone wants to talk to him about the same thing.
Cats, of course.
And more specifically: Cats in space.
That's what happens when you create a graphic-novel series about an elite team of cat astronauts called the "CatStronauts." All the kids want to tell you about their own little Neil Armstrongs.
"Right away, they start telling me about their cats," Brockington says and laughs. "They're like, 'Oh, our cat could go into space like that.' And I'm like, 'OK...'"
Brockington, of course, is more than happy to talk about cats at Saturday's Southwest Florida Reading Festival. He'll be one of 19 authors attending the 20th annual event, including novelists Peter Swanson, Karen White and Lauren Willig; children's author Jackson Pearce; and audiobook narrator Johnny Heller.
Seattle novelist Tara Conklin will be there, too, hot off the success of her brand-new New York Times bestseller "The Last Romantics." It's Conklin's follow-up to her previous bestseller, "The House Girl," so she's starting to get used to attending reading festivals.
"They're great fun!" she says. "You get to meet other writers as well as readers."
Writing is mostly a solitary activity, Conklin explains. So it's good to get out of the house and interact with real people for a change.
"That once a month shower happens," she says and laughs. "And I put on clothes other than pajamas."
An estimated 10,000 readers attend the Southwest Florida Reading Festival every year, says fest coordinator Melissa Baker. And organizers want to give them something special for the downtown Fort Myers event's 20th anniversary.
Saturday's fest will feature 19 authors — four more than last year's 15. And this time, First Street will be blocked off in front of Fort Myers Regional Library to make room for food trucks and food vendors. That way, Baker says, people can grab some barbecue, Jamaican food, ice cream, cupcakes and other food — and then they can get back to the authors.
"We certainly want to make it special and significant," Baker says about the 20th anniversary fest. "And we'll have more of a festive atmosphere with the food trucks."
The free festival takes place 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and features book signings, meet-and-greets, author talks, readings, kids activities and more. This is the second year the event has taken place at the library instead of its usual Centennial Park and Harborside Event Center, due to construction and renovation at Harborside.
The Lee County Library System organizes the popular event every year to celebrate reading and shine a spotlight on the library's many services. "It's to share the joy of reading and just celebrate literacy," Baker says.
Conklin and Brockington are happy to celebrate along with their fans. And they're willing to answer questions people have about everything from their writing processes to the inspirations behind their popular books.
The idea for Conklin's "The Last Romantics," for example, originated with a tragedy in the Conklin family. She won't go into specifics about what happened, though — and for a good reason. "It's a total spoiler!" she says.
That family tragedy happened about 15 years ago.
"This event prompted a lot of questions in my head about love and family and obligation and success and betrayal and grief," she says. "And all of these questions planted themselves in the back of my brain and they percolated there for about a decade. And then I sat down to explore them with a fictional family that I called The Skinners."
Another inspiration: Growing up with two sisters and then, later, becoming the mother of three kids. "Watching their sibling dynamic is eternally fascinating to me," Conklin says.
Minneapolis author Brockington got the idea for his CatStronauts after drawing a cat astronaut in his sketch book. His graphic novels follow the adventures of space cats Major Meowser, Waffles, Blanket and Pom Pom.
"For me, it was just a fun, cute drawing in my sketchbook and a way I can use all these bad cat puns," Brockington says. "That's why I like it!
"It's a fun name to say and a fun idea. Cats are so graceful on the planet. So what would they look like in zero gravity?"
It wasn't until later, when he Googled the term "catstronaut," that he discovered cat astronauts were already a popular meme. "There's this whole subculture!" Brockington says.
His "CatStronaut" series taps into that subculture and offers even more, he says. "I always tell people, if you like space, adventure, bad jokes or cats, you might enjoy these books."
If you don't like cats, that's OK, too. There are 18 other authors to choose from Saturday.

Judge tosses defamation suit against NY Times

Texto completo: A University of Florida horticulture professor known for his scientific defense of genetically modified foods lost his defamation suit against journalist Eric Lipton and the New York Times for describing his close relationships with biotech giants including Monsanto.
Chief U.S. Judge Mark E. Walker of the Northern District of Florida in Tallahassee Wednesday granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Lipton and the Times and directed the clerk of courts to file it dismissed with prejudice. No hearing was held.
Summary judgment is appropriately granted when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law," Walker said.
In his ruling, Walker reaffirmed Florida's "fair report" privilege for journalists and the state's public records laws.
The professor, Kevin Folta, said he had no comment at this time.
"We are pleased with the Court's decision," said Mark Caramanica of the Thomas and LoCicero law firm that represented Lipton and the Times. "This is a case that should have never been brought, over an important story based on Dr. Folta's own communications that shed light on public academics' relationships with the food industry."
Barbara Petersen, President of the First Amendment Foundation, lauded the decision as a big win for open government.
"Ostensibly, it's a defamation case, but the court's language on the public records law is hugely important and reinforces the public's right of access and solidifies the importance of oversight and accountability," Petersen said. "The arguments raised by Professor Folta are are typical of agency arguments used too frequently to frustrate access to basic email records and the Court saw through those arguments."
In his lawsuit filed in October 2017, Folta claimed that Lipton and the Times "manipulated an interview" to advance their own "anti-GMO agenda" by making him appear to be a "covertly paid operative of one of the largest and controversial companies in America, Monsanto."
To further their "subjective agenda," Folta claimed, the defendants placed a lengthy article above the fold in the Sunday Sept. 6, 2015 New York Times, "the day after posting this scandalous article on the New York Times' website, with false and misleading headlines and bylines, to draw readers into the manifestly false and misleading content."
The defendants said the article purported to document how both biotech and organics companies cultivated relationships with public university professors. The article relied on interviews and public records, including emails between Folta and executives with Monsanto and other biotech companies.
The Times and Lipton said statements in the article were true, were not "of and concerning" Folta, were not susceptible to a defamatory meaning, protected under the fair report privilege or as pure opinion and barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
Lipton and The Times noted that all but one of the 32 statements cited in the defamation suit were protected by Florida's fair report privilege, which allows journalists "to report accurately on information received from government officials."
Folta argued his emails weren't public records, but Walker said they clearly are as defined by Florida's public records law. Walker elaborated in great detail his analysis of the statements as related to the fair report privilege, which is broad and only requires that statements be "substantially" correct in presentation of the information received.
"Protection of the privilege is not lost, for example, by colorful language or a failure to look beyond the government documents for verification," Walker wrote. "Editorial style is expected, and news media can phrase their coverage to 'catch . . . the readership's attention.'"
In his ruling, Walker expressed sympathy toward Folta in his attempt to protect his reputation as an independent, impartial scientist in seeking a narrow interpretation of the state's public record law and fair report doctrine.
"This case is not one cooked up by billionaire opponents of a free media. Plaintiff seeks only a remedy for the reputational damage he alleges he suffered because of Defendants' publication," Walker wrote.
"A cramped reading of the privilege would undercut its very purpose. It would open the door to far less meritorious suits by far less scrupulous plaintiffs, and it would contribute to the ongoing chipping-away of the rights and privileges necessary to the press's ability to play its intended role as government watchdog," the judge added. "This Court will not do so."

Texto completo: Ryan Adams' upcoming U. K. and Ireland tour has been canceled, Ticketmaster announced Friday, in the wake of a recent New York Times story alleging that the musician manipulated and harassed women sexually and emotionally.
Ticketmaster Ireland announced the news in a tweeted statement.
"The Ryan Adams UK & Ireland tour has been cancelled," the tweet reads. "Full refunds to ticket purchasers from authorised outlets will be processed by end of day on Monday. Please allow time for the repayment transaction to hit your account. "
The news of Adams' canceled tour follows Universal Music Group's decision to halt the release of his forthcoming album "Big Colors," which was scheduled to be released on April 19.
More: FBI reportedly looking into allegations Ryan Adams sexted with underage fan
On Feb. 14, the New York Times reported that the FBI's New York field office was investigating whether the 44-year-old musician committed a crime by having phone sex and exchanging graphic texts with an underage girl.
Seven women -- including Adams' ex-wife Mandy Moore and singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers -- and more than a dozen other associates accused Adams of championing aspiring female artists and then exploiting them and stifling their ambitions, often for his own sexual gain.
More: Mandy Moore on marriage to Ryan Adams: 'I felt like I was drowning'
“I was living my life for him. … I had no sense of self,” Moore recently told Marc Maron on an episode of his WTF podcast about her "unhealthy dynamic" with Adams. “I felt like I was drowning. It was so untenable and unsustainable, and it was so lonely. I was so sad. I was lonely with him. ”
Moore, who was married to Adams from 2009 to 2016, told The Times that her ex-husband used her own musical ambitions as a tool to control and hurt her.
“Music was a point of control for him,” she told the outlet. “His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time – my entire mid-to-late 20s. "
USA TODAY has reached out to the FBI for comment.

FEAST ON FEMALE FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Texto completo: Two food writers are giving the adage "a woman's place is in the kitchen" a feminist twist.
Co-authored by Life & Thyme's Stef Ferrari and Deepi Ahluwalia, "A Woman's Place: The Inventors, Rumrunners, Lawbreakers, Scientists, and Single Moms Who Changed the World with Food," out March 5, is an anthology on female culinary innovations, with profiles of women from various backgrounds and time periods.
amNewYork spoke to Ferrari, who lives in Cobble Hill, about six whose stories connect to NYC.
Pauline Morton Sabin (1887-1955), socialite involved in repealing Prohibition
"I think there's this notion that, across the board, all women supported and advocated for Prohibition. But Pauline's story is fascinating because she saw it as ineffective and ultimately argued that it caused greater problems by creating opportunities and motivation for criminal behavior. Pauline rallied more than a million women who shared that belief and worked toward Prohibition reform."
Esther Eng (1914-1970), film director and restaurateur
"She was a daughter of Chinese immigrants in San Francisco. She took up filmmaking and moved to New York and recognized that a lot of the Chinese actors that she had been working with were struggling financially. She opened a restaurant almost as a platform to give them a place to work and hone their English, so that when they went to acting gigs they could communicate better. She wound up opening several restaurants in New York. Esther lived openly as a lesbian as well. She faced quite a lot of adversity in her day, and her legacy is one of inclusivity, empathy and, of course, food!"
Edna Lewis (1916-2006), chef at Café Nicholson and Gage and Tollner
"Edna's influence simply can't be overstated. She showed people the scope of Southern cuisine beyond the stereotypical 'soul food' - though you could hardly imagine saying her food was without soul! She was far ahead of her time in demonstrating that restaurant meals could focus on fresh and seasonal cooking. Her work helped make Café Nicholson legendary. It was a hangout for Tennessee Williams, Capote, Brando, Garbo, Dietrich - you name it. They all came for her food."
Judith Jones (1924-2017), Alfred A. Knopf editor who oversaw cookbooks by the likes of Julia Child and Edna Lewis
"She was such a visionary when it came to identifying these powerful voices in food. She was such a champion, and as an editor, she helped find, support and propel these women to the culinary world's stage. It's because of Judith that we have some of the most important cookbooks of our time - not to mention a window into other worlds and cultures through their cuisine."
Dorothy Cann Hamilton (1949-2016), founder of the International Culinary Center
"Dorothy was a woman who knew the one thing all great entrepreneurs must know: how to identify and fill a need. After she traveled to France, she recognized that American culinary schools couldn't hold a candle to what she'd seen abroad. Because of her decision to come back and launch the French Culinary Institute in NYC (now the International Culinary Center), we have some of our most famous chefs - including New York icons like Christina Tosi and Bobby Flay."

"Ruth showed up at a time when food books and magazines were almost exclusively about recipes. She showed the humanity behind food, and really helped create modern food journalism, by demonstrating through her work at Gourmet as well as her time at The New York Times, that there were real stories and lessons to be learned about people and culture from the food world."

Texto completo: Should we go to the Pinegrove show? There's no good answer at the end of this story, and there's no good answer at the end of this line, which stretches down the ashen concrete sidewalk outside the Black Cat in Washington on a recent Thursday night - hundreds of Pinegrove fans literally waiting around in a gray area.
It's been 15 months since the intrepid New Jersey indie troupe went silent after Pinegrove bandleader Evan Stephens Hall posted on Facebook in November 2017 explaining that he had been "accused of sexual coercion" by a woman he had been in a relationship with. Hall's statement was both murky and long-winded, but he accepted responsibility for his actions - even though it remains unclear what those actions were. In respect to his alleged victim's wishes, Hall put the band on hold for a year and started therapy. Then, in September, Pitchfork ran a deep and intimately reported profile of the band that aimed to account for the staggering complexity of Pinegrove's imminent return.
Illuminating as the story was, it still left fans stranded in a glowing fog - and with decisions to make. Stick with this band? Forgive?
Talk to more than two dozen Pinegrove fans queued up outside of the Black Cat and you'll find them mulling these questions with great nuance. And yet, the same words keep popping up. Many say they were "confused" by Hall's original Facebook post, mainly because it was so "vague," but that the Pitchfork story was "clarifying," and that Hall's return might be the "right way" for public figures implicated in the #MeToo movement to try to rehabilitate themselves - "maybe."
Before the club opens its doors, you can almost see the question marks floating over the sidewalk. "I'm very involved in sexual assault awareness at my school," says Rebekah Boggs, 20, a student at the University of Virginia. "So it's definitely an uncomfortable position to be in as a fan. ... I don't really know how to feel. I'm still uncomfortable telling my friends, 'I'm going to the Pinegrove concert.' "
Some of those friends have "canceled" Pinegrove, exercising their right to excommunicate a public figure for unconscionable behavior - at least in digital space.
"I definitely feel that in a lot of situations, cancel culture doesn't help anyone, that it's a reductive and regressive way of addressing societal ills," says Nicholas Kohomban, 23, down from Brooklyn for the show. "Especially in Evan's situation, here's someone being very open, and honest, and vulnerable, and admitting that they probably did something wrong, and inviting criticism." Kohomban adds, "So he's not Ryan Adams, right?"
As far as we can tell, Hall is not Ryan Adams. Ryan Adams, that famously petulant songwriter who was recently exposed in The New York Times for his alleged transgressions against women. Ryan Adams, a star who got away with all kinds of ugly behavior for nearly two decades.
In the days following the Times report, distributors shelved Adams' forthcoming album, radio stations yanked his songs from the air, and the FBI launched an inquiry. But let's see how he's doing a year from now.
Meantime, as the world watched Adams squirm out of owning his alleged misdeeds on Twitter, Pinegrove's more devout fans say they've seen Hall "doing the right thing" over the past year. He didn't dismiss the accusation. He accepted responsibility, publicly and completely. He followed his alleged accuser's wishes while respecting her anonymity. He sought help. Now, Pinegrove fans want to feel that they're doing the right thing too - which means showing up to the club with all of their skepticism and whatever's left of their enthusiasm.
"Cancel culture can be very toxic when the situation is hazy. So I didn't want to come to any assumptions, and it's been very difficult to come to terms with his (Facebook) statement," says Alyssa Dahle, 21, of Ellicott City, Md. "In terms of what actually happened, nobody knows. And we won't know."
And once we're all inside, Pinegrove takes the stage, almost cautiously, slowly setting that metaphorical gray fog aglow with music. These songs feel as delicate as rock songs can, with old lyrics that now mean new things. For instance, on "Rings" - composed and recorded before Hall was accused - the frontman delivers a line about self-exposure that feels as if it had been written for the audience now assembled before him: "I trust you so much."
Between numbers, Hall thanks the crowd in a silence-filling kind of way, but he still radiates sincerity in the right amounts. He's trying to do everything right. He says nothing about remorse, or loyalty, or contrition, or healing - but he does thank everyone in the building for "being so kind to us and so kind to each other."
Hall isn't trying to change your mind, but the music might be. A good Pinegrove song teases out the confessional commonalities between emo and country music to do something mysteriously empathetic. It's the kind of music that can make you feel that it hears you.
It becomes nearly impossible to drag your brain back out to the sidewalk, back to those hours leading up to the show when you were thinking about all of the unknowns, all of the missing pieces in this story, the anonymous accuser we'll never know, all of the absences. But try to imagine the absent. Imagine everyone who made different decisions and stayed home. Now, imagine if they could hear everyone here singing along. Does it sound like anything other than forgiveness?

Texto completo: Ariana Grande at Capital One Arena, March 25 How do you even begin to describe the meteoric rise of Ariana Grande in the past calendar year? The 25-year-old had firmly asserted her spot among pop's premier talents, but then became the it girl of pop through sheer force of will. You could point to the breathless coverage of her relationship with comedian Pete Davidson or her ability to spin that coverage into content across song and social media. But let's stick with her music, which attracts devotion because of Grande's undeniably powerful vocals, slick production and ability to effortlessly churn out earworms. 8 p.m. Ticket prices vary. - Hau Chu
New African Film Festival at AFI Silver , March 7
This 15th annual showcase of contemporary African cinema features 37 films from 22 countries, including several U.S. premieres. One highlight of many is "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind" (March 16 at 7 p.m.), a Netflix film that marks the feature directorial debut of Oscar-nominated actor Chiwetel Ejiofor. Set in Malawi, the film tells the true story of William Kamkwamba, who, as a teenager, designed and built a makeshift wind turbine to power appliances in his village, using trees, bicycle parts and junkyard scraps. Through March 17. $13 general admission. - Michael O'Sullivan

D.C. Brewers' Guild Hopfest at DC Brau , March 9
The annual D.C. Brewers' Guild Hopfest is nirvana for hopheads, with a number of the area's coolest breweries bringing their most hop-forward beers to a festival at DC Brau. Just don't expect a parade of tongue-puckeringly bitter IPAs: Previous years have included zestily hopped lagers, pale ales packed with sweetly tropical hop flavors and boozy imperial IPAs. The laid-back gathering draws from beyond the District borders - Aslin, Dogfish Head, Ocelot and Adroit Theory are among this year's two dozen participants - and it's easy to mingle and chat with brewers while enjoying unlimited samples, snacks from food trucks and music spun by a DJ. 1 to 5 p.m. $40. - Fritz Hahn

Robyn at the Anthem , March 9
Swedish pop singer Robyn started out as a preteen voice actress before becoming a teen pop singer who worked with (then-emerging) Swedish hitmakers Max Martin and Denniz Pop. "Show Me Love" became her first big U.S. hit in 1997, and then she sort of disappeared from the American consciousness, emerging every so often with a minor song or collaboration. Her comeback arrived in 2010 in the form of "Dancing on My Own," a dance floor anthem that soundtracked a scene in HBO's "Girls" and turned Robyn into an indie rock-approved pop star. After that year's "Body Talk," Robyn mostly disappeared again but did make an EP with Royksopp before finally returning to her solo career last year with "Honey." Like "Body Talk," "Honey" is full of forward-thinking dance music and big pop hooks ("Missing U" and the title track in particular), but there's a softness and warmth to this album that reflects the current mood of its creator, who turns 40 this year. 7 p.m. Sold out. - Rudi Greenberg

U Street Music Hall 9-Year Anniversary Week , March 15
For the past nine years, U Street Music Hall has been an integral part of the U Street NW neighborhood and local music community at- arge. Initially a venue for electronic acts, it has evolved its schedule to include a much more robust variety of music, which is exemplified with its anniversary party. The 10-day celebration kicks off with a DJ set from Los Angeles duo Classixx, followed by U Street Music Hall co-owner Will Eastman's album release party and alt-country artist Maggie Rose on March 16. Through March 24. Times and prices vary. - Stephanie Williams

Direct Current at the Kennedy Center , March 24
Direct Current is a two-week festival helmed by the Kennedy Center celebrating progressive performance pieces from emerging and established artists across the globe. The schedule touts a diverse slate of dance, music and theater shows at the Kennedy Center and other smaller venues around town, including Bon Iver's collaborative effort, "Come Through" (March 25), which features new music from the indie-folk outfit and choreography from TU Dance. Through April 7. Times and prices vary. - Stephanie Williams

Baseball returns to Nationals Park , March 25, 28-31
The Nationals' new era begins with back-to-back games against teams from the Big Apple. The Nats' lone home exhibition game brings the Yankees to Nationals Park on March 25, while the real season gets underway against the division rival Mets a few days later. It's a mixed bag for fans who haven't visited the Navy Yard area since last fall: Justin's Cafe, a popular gathering place for Nats fans, closed suddenly in October, and Walter's Sports Bar, a transplant from Petworth that made a pop-up appearance during the All-Star Game festivities, is rushing to get its doors open by Opening Day. Two of the biggest ticket items - the game-filled Punch Bowl Social on Half Street and a new Dacha Beer Garden in the same building as All Purpose and Salt Line - aren't quite ready yet, but as with a World Series title, hope springs eternal. Times and ticket prices vary. - Fritz Hahn

Maggie Rogers at 9:30 Club , March 25-26
The recipe for an emerging pop star has been finely tuned in 2019: Mix a few dashes of tightly produced beats with a sprinkling of electrifying pipes tuned up for anthemic choruses and, voilà, you have Maggie Rogers. The Maryland-born singer appeared on "Saturday Night Live" and headlined D.C.'s All Things Go Festival before "Heard It In A Past Life" was released in January. The album contains a couple of the singles that vaulted her into the spotlight, as well as some new tracks that show some of the restraint and potential of the young songwriter. The 24-year-old will headline two sold-out shows at the 9:30 Club, and if you're lucky enough to snag a ticket, it might be the last time you can see Rogers on a stage this small for a long time. 7 p.m. (doors). Sold out. - Hau Chu

Earl Sweatshirt at the Fillmore , March 26
The mercurial rapper performed the most impressive musical balancing trick of 2018: The 25-year-old emcee, born Thebe Kgositsile, made his most personal album with "Some Rap Songs," which contemplatively meditates on past and current traumas, all while running the length of a TV sitcom. As a teenager, Kgositsile established himself as a teenager with the Los Angeles collective Odd Future but was sent by his mother to a school in American Samoa for his antics in the group. The rapper returned from the Pacific as a cult icon and released two albums, 2013's polished "Doris" and his defining 2015 opus, "I Don't Like S---, I Don't Go Outside." With "Some Rap Songs," Kgositsile merges his coastal influences of L.A.'s jazz wave with some offbeat, heady New York lyricism - the album was his last on a major label, and he has hinted at releasing music independently and under a new moniker. 8 p.m. $30-$79. - Hau Chu

'Empresses of China's Forbidden City, 1644-1912' at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery , March 30
When this exhibition on China's Qing dynasty empresses opened at Massachusetts's Peabody Essex Museum last year, the New York Times called the show "huge and opulent," but also "gratifyingly rigorous." Now coming to the District, the show includes a pair of pearl-bedecked platform boots that "would not have been out of place on 'Soul Train' " according to the Times. But beyond such eye-popping fashion items, "Empresses" also offers insight into changing female power dynamics. One of the show's subjects - the dowager empress Cixi (1835-1908) - rose much further than many other wives (who were, despite their high status, considered the emperor's property). After her husband's death in 1861, Cixi effectively ruled China as regent for 47 years. On opening day, museum festivities will include live performances, food to sample from imperial court recipes, kite-flying and art-making activities. Through June 23. Free. - Michael O'Sullivan

Texto completo: The first of what could be multiple lawsuits challenging the legitimacy of Toledo's newly passed Lake Erie Bill of Rights was filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court.

In a 28-page complaint, attorneys representing Drewes Farms Partnership of Custar, Ohio, are asking for the successful ballot initiative to be thrown out on the grounds it is unconstitutional and unlawful.

Courts have routinely invalidated similar governmental overreaches across the country, including many backed by some of the same groups behind LEBOR, the document states. Despite this, a member of the Toledo City Council and proponents of LEBOR have publicly stated that LEBOR was enacted to send a message.

The councilman was not identified by name in the complaint. But the document cites a New York Times article from earlier this month in which Councilman Nick Komives was quoted saying he initially went along with other councilmen in opposing the measure because it is probably unconstitutional.

But Mr. Komives also said in that same article that he is a strong proponent of Lake Erie and - as an activist - believes it is sometimes important to send a message.

The lawsuit claims that Drewes Farms Partnership, a fifth-generation business operated by Mark and Tyler Drewes, is being exposed to massive liability and financial risk because, even as a recognized leader for agricultural practices, it can never guarantee that all runoff will be prevented from entering the Lake Erie watershed.

If Drewes Farms cannot fertilize its fields, it will be unable to survive economically, the lawsuit states. Drewes Farms must soon begin fertilizing its fields in March or April for this growing season.

The suit names the city of Toledo as the defendant, in care of City Law Director Dale R. Emch.

We are still reviewing the lawsuit, so I'm not in a position to comment on it specifically, Mr. Emch said in a statement to The Blade. Everyone involved knew the charter amendment would be the subject of litigation eventually. We will defend the City as the legal process takes its course.

The suit was filed by the Columbus-based law firm of Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease.

The law firm said it was not making its two attorneys assigned to the case, Thomas Fusonie and Daniel Shuey, available for interviews on Wednesday.

But a statement issued by the firm's spokesman, Jennifer House, quoted Mr. Fusonie as saying he believes the Lake Erie Bill of Rights is unconstitutional and unlawful assault on the fundamental rights of family farms in the Lake Erie watershed.

The Lake Erie Bill of Rights was passed by a 61-39 percent margin in a special election on Tuesday night. It calls for Toledo's city charter to be amended in a way that it recognizes Lake Erie - as a natural resource used for drinking water by 12 million U.S. and Canadian citizens, including Toledo's - has a right to carry less of an environmental burden than it has for decades.

Legal experts are still unsure exactly how that new approach will be carried out.

Ken Kilbert, a University of Toledo law professor and UT's Legal Institute of the Great Lakes director, said he expects to see a flurry of lawsuits and counter-suits in response to the Lake Erie Bill of Rights because it doesn't clearly define its parameters.

Taken literally, the measure could force arguments over whether state and federal discharge permits should be invalidated -and about how far local government can go toward arguing Lake Erie and all of the watersheds flowing into it must be free of pollution well beyond the city of Toledo's jurisdiction.

This is turning it on its head, Mr. Kilbert said of conventional permit-issuing regulation. That certainly is a different way of doing things.

He said the lake's new bill of rights is meant to disrupt the system.

What this does is eliminate the reasonable balancing part, Mr. Kilbert said. This doesn't draw any lines. This is a blunt instrument. My view is this - while a well-intentioned document, is legally flawed.

The potentially far-reaching aspects of the Lake Erie Bill of Rights also have concerned Frank Merritt, a UT professor of law emeritus and longtime ecology director for Boy Scouts of America programs.

In a Feb. 23 Facebook post, three days before the election, Mr. Merritt said the bill is unusual in that it defies a longstanding norm for municipalities to limit their reach to their own borders.

It was recognized before the American Revolution that no one had right to poison his neighbor's waters or stream. It has also been long recognized that regulations and prohibitions have to be sufficiently definite so that reasonable persons can determine what is prohibited and how to conduct themselves, Mr. Merritt wrote. Voting for this provision will make you feel good, but it will do nothing to clean up Lake Erie. To the extent that that City has to spend money defending the law, it will simply be a waste of needed public funds.

Supporters disagree, contending the measure puts into effect a new way of looking at -and protecting -one of the world's greatest bodies of fresh water.

The bill was put before voters by a grass-roots group of activists called Toledoans for Safe Water. With help from another group, Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie, more than enough signatures were gathered for a citywide referendum on the November ballot.

But Toledo City Council and the Lucas County Board of Elections initially balked, citing concerns over enforcement. They eventually had a change of heart, with the Ohio Supreme Court upholding the right of the groups to put the ballot question before voters in Tuesday's special election.

Markie Miller, Toledoans for Safe Water organizer, said at her group's victory party Tuesday night it anticipates multiple legal challenges in the coming months -but is not going to be dissuaded.

We expect this effort to bring about discussions and challenges - but hopefully ones inspired by the desire to create positive and meaningful changes and not ones based on fear and misunderstanding, she added on Wednesday morning.

Sandy Bihn, Lake Erie Waterkeeper executive director, said in a Feb. 23 letter published by The Blade that the time has come for the agricultural industry to be held accountable for billions of dollars it has received to reduce the flow of manure and commercially made fertilizer from area farms when there is heavy rain.

On Wednesday, she said it would be a Lake Erie win for everyone if passage of the Lake Erie Bill of Rights inspires more people to come together on a comprehensive plan for combating algae, instead of resorting to more litigation.

Texto completo: Israeli Drama 'Shtisel' Lives up to Hype
TELEVISION
SHTISEL, AN ISRAELI drama Netflix picked up in December, can best be summarized by a quote from Marta Kauffman, the creator of Friends, who has said she is working on an American version of the show.
"Make sure those stories, and the universality of those stories, is what people take in," she told Variety in 2016. "The rest is just background."
Shtisel, which is available on Netflix with English subtitles, follows a Haredi family in the Geula neighborhood of Jerusalem. Since its Netflix release - it originally premiered in Israel in 2013 and ran for two seasons - word has spread. On social media, people are recommending the show to their friends, and reviews have lauded Shtisel for portraying the ultra-Orthodox as "ordinary" people.
What is certainly true about the show is that its storylines and the actors' performances are so engrossing, it's almost easy to forget about the characters' peyot and sheitals. This is probably because the stories aren't about how the characters' struggle with their religion, unlike other portrayals of the Orthodox in mainstream media, such as One of Us, Disobedience and 7he Chosen. Instead, they are about love or loss or other universal stories.
That certainly does not mean their ultra-Orthodoxy is merely incidental. It shapes the storylines, such as in one plotline where a main character searches for love during hotel lobby dates arranged by a matchmaker.
The way the show follows its characters and its subtle, slow drama is reminiscent of Amazon Prime Video's Transparent, another show about a Jewish family. Shtisel's primary focus is on the family's patriarch, Shulem Shtisel (Dov Glickman), and his youngest son, Akiva (Michael Aloni), the last of Shulem s children to still live at home.
Agrande esta imagen.

Shulem is an imposing man in his 60s with a dark gray beard, whose wife passed away about a year before the start of the show. He works as the teacher and later principal of a cheder and has a penchant for falling asleep in front of the Talmud as he studies late into the night. His rigid demeanor, sense of duty to tradition and attempts to control his offspring might spark some dry laughter in viewers. During the series, he spends time with a few widows and divorcees but is reluctant to settle down with any of them, seemingly more interested in their cholent.
Akiva, on the other hand, is a romantic and a dreamer. (Sometimes literally, such as when in the first episode, he starts a heater loan program after dreaming about being cold - in the early spring.) He's a young man in his mid-20s, fresh out of yeshiva and starting a job as a teacher at his father's cheder, while nursing aspirations of becoming an artist.
Outside of work and his time sketching animals at the zoo, he meets young women in hotel lobbies for dates. He's in pursuit of true love and has been disappointed by his dates so far. Then, he meets Elisheva (Ayelet Zurer), an older woman and twice-widowed mother of one of his students. He pursues her, while she struggles with guilt over the deaths of her husbands.
Aloni shines in this show. His performance exemplifies how the show almost makes you forget that its characters are Haredi. Akiva's status as both an insider and an outsider (he's accepted as one of the Haredi community, though considered somewhat peculiar) provides the secular audience with a relatable perspective and an entry point into the insular Haredi community.
The show also follows other members of the family, in particular Akiva's sister, Giti Weiss (Neta Riskin), a homemaker and mother of five. After her husband abandons their family and stops sending money from Argentina, where his work as a shochet takes him for months at a time, Giti struggles to make ends meet. She keeps her situation a secret from almost everybody so as to make it easier for her husband to return. The only one who knows is her teenage daughter, Ruchami (Shira Haas), who fills in as parent for her younger siblings.
Other important characters in the family at the start of the series include Shulem's octogenarian mother Malka (Hanna Rieber), who has taken to watching soap operas in her nursing home, and Zvi Arye (Harel Piterman), Akiva's older brother, whose lighthearted escapades are maybe intended to release tension from the show but which instead take time away from other more compelling storylines.
Shtisel's Netflix release has renewed interest in the show to such a degree that Dikla Bárkái, a producer for the production company behind the show, told The New York Times that the creators are thinking about creating a third season.
That popularity has been evident in Jews from across the religious spectrum.
One of the show's creators, Yehonatan Indursky, grew up in a Haredi family, which lends the show its needed authenticity.
"Shtisel gives secular Israelis, live-and-let-live Jewish Americans of all persuasions, and non-Jews alike a glimpse into the mysterious and cloistered world of the ultra-Orthodox," one Orthodox commentator, Ruchi Koval, wrote for the Cleveland Jewish News. "But when it draws back that curtain, here's what you find: your father, your sister, your neighbor. They are you, and you are they. That's what makes it so lovable, and that's what makes it so fun."

Economic policies or pipedreams?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - As Democrats swing left, it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine what their triumph in the next election would mean for America.
The presidential candidates endorse a variety of far-reaching proposals that, if adopted, would represent the largest expansion of government since Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The added spending, taxes or deficits could total hundreds of billions.
Are these sound economic policies or partisan pipedreams?
Let's review the main proposals. For context, remember the following: The U.S. economy (gross domestic product) is about $20 trillion, so a federal program costing $200 billion would be 1 percent of GDP. It would also be about 5 percent of the $4 trillion federal budget.
Here's the rundown:
- (BEG BOLD)Guaranteed job program(END BOLD): Several candidates have proposed creating an employer of last resort to hire anyone who wanted a job but couldn't find one. Economists at Bard College estimated that such a program would initially hire 15 million workers at $15 an hour; health insurance and retirement benefits would add another 20 percent. The initial cost would be around $300 billion annually.
- (BEG BOLD)Medicare-for-all(END BOLD): Bernie Sanders proposed this, and it has become a proxy for almost any proposal that attains universal health insurance coverage. Its cost is unclear (in 2017, there were an estimated 27 million uninsured), says a report from PolitiFact of the Poynter Institute. Sanders thinks replacing private insurance with Medicare could cut expenses. Other experts disagree. There would be pressures to sweeten benefits. In a recent New York Times column, economist Paul Krugman wrote that "we'd need a lot more [tax] revenue to implement for Medicare-for-all.
"The Green New Deal: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., propose putting the country on a war footing to purge U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions over a decade. The costs aren't known, because the "new deal manifesto contains no concrete proposals. However, it must be sweeping and expensive if the government is to subsidize "clean energy and suppress fossil fuels.
Everything else: There are smaller proposals that, in other years, would seem large. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., backs subsidies for child care at an annual cost of $70 billion. Sanders would provide free tuition at state colleges and universities for most students. That's perhaps another $50 billion. Then there's "infrastructure spending - more billions - and a proposal to raise Social Security benefits.
Counting plausible costs from programs without official estimates, the total could easily equal the existing budget deficit ($779 billion in 2018). The actual amount could be more - or less. No one really knows.
How would Democrats pay for this? Some spending would be offset by taxes on the wealthy. Krugman doubts these would suffice. Adopting any major health proposals would probably require sizable increases in "payroll taxes and/or a value-added tax that hit the middle class, he writes.
Of course, there is another choice: more deficit spending. Last week, I tried to educate myself on so-called "modern monetary theory. Embraced by some Democrats, its central thesis seems to be that deficits are not nearly as dangerous as we've been led to believe. Here's the case for that view, as best I can determine.
"The biggest mistake we make is thinking of the federal government as a household that has to repay its debt, says Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University and an adviser in 2016 to Sanders.
The United States won't default on its governmental debts, because it can always create more dollars - through the Federal Reserve - to honor U.S. Treasury bonds and bills, she says. She rejects the argument that the Fed might generate inflation by flooding the economy with too much money. To prevent that, inflationary pressures can be offset through higher taxes and interest rates, just as occurs today.
The obsession with controlling government deficits hinders us in stabilizing the economy and promoting maximum employment, she contends. This may or may not be good economics, but it's certainly expedient. No one likes to raise taxes and cut spending, and that may explain why benign neglect of deficits is now going mainstream.
Check out the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. "Washington should end its debt obsession, urge Lawrence Summers and Jason Furman, top economic officials in the Clinton and Obama administrations. Interest rates are low. It's better to borrow and spend on "education, health care and infrastructure.
What's missing from this picture is old-fashioned prudence. True, the government doesn't have to default on its debt in a legal sense. But if financial markets worry about the escalating debt, Treasury bonds will lose value. If the fall in confidence is great enough, it might trigger a panic, made worse by the reality that the dollar is the main international currency.
Our ever-ascending debt increases our vulnerability to a future crisis that we cannot see but, almost certainly, awaits us.

Texto completo: Hate crimes happen. I don't much like the term, but let's accept that it as modern shorthand for criminal acts, usually of violence, motivated by some form of prejudice, be it racial, religious, sexual, or otherwise.
Last Monday evening, my friend Maajid Nawaz — founder of the anti-extremist organization Quilliam and a host on London's LBC radio — was the victim of such a crime. As he stood outside the Soho Theatre on Dean Street, a white man called him a “Paki" and punched him in the face. The assault occurred after Maajid challenged the man for mocking an Asian family because “they weren't English." There were several witnesses.
I am sure more than one politician must have condemned this attack. However, the only quotation I have found was from the Shadow Home Secretary, Diane Abbott, who described it as “shocking."
At the end of last month, another hate crime was reported. The victim was the gay African-American actor Justin (“Jussie") Smollett, who claimed that he had been attacked in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood by two white men in ski masks who told him, “This is MAGA country." They then poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck. The actor told the police that he had fought them off.
This being America, politicians were ready to express their outrage at this abhorrent hate crime. Democratic senators and would-be presidential candidates Cory Booker and Kamala Harris denounced it as an “attempted modern day lynching." The only hitch is that this particular hate crime appears to have been staged by Smollett with the help of two brothers of Nigerian descent previously employed as extras in “Empire," the television series in which Smollett appears.
It is certainly tempting to ridicule Smollett and the politicians and media folk who too readily swallowed his story. The best line came from Titania McGrath — the spoof social justice warrior whose Twitter account mercilessly mocks “woke" culture: “It is absolutely *essential* that we believe Jussie Smollett," she tweeted. “If we don't, other people who haven't been attacked might not have the courage to come forward."
Yet there is something more serious going on here. Smollett's fraud on the public might have gone undetected had it not been for the tireless work of the Portland-based journalist Andy Ngo, who smelled a rat from the outset. In a mind-blowing Twitter thread, Ngo has now listed more than 30 fake hate crimes from the past two years.
What motivates someone to bear false witness in this way? As I said, there is no lack of real hate crime. According to the US Department of Justice, more than 7,000 hate crime incidents were reported in the United States in 2017. In England and Wales, you may be surprised to learn, 94,000 offenses were identified as hate crimes in the year after April 2017. This doesn't mean that there is 13 times more violent bigotry in Britain than in the United States, any more than the lower figures for 2016 mean that there has been a “surge" in hate crime. The statistics reflect the reclassification of perennial acts of violence or vandalism as hate crimes — and the ways the public and police are incentivized to report them as such.
The problem is that there is not enough of the right kind of hate crime to validate the narrative, so cherished by the left, that Trump's election unleashed a wave of white supremacist violence. Only half of the known offenders in US hate crimes in 2017 were in fact white. Anti-Semitic acts often turn out to be by nonwhite perpetrators, though you would need to read between the lines of The New York Times to work that out.
Under these awkward circumstances, there is clearly an immense demand for tales of murderous MAGA-hat-wearing rednecks roaming the streets of, er, Chicago and New York, conurbations famed for their large populations of such people. On Thursday, Kamala Harris said she was “sad, frustrated, and disappointed" by the news of Jussie Smollett's arrest. “Disappointed" says it all.
This is the same senator who refused even to address a question to my wife, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, when she testified about Islamic extremism before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in June 2017. Why? Because Islamic extremism is the wrong sort of extremism. Democrats like Harris only want to talk about white extremism — in the same way that the phony civil rights organization the Southern Poverty Law Center used to publish a list of “Anti-Muslim Extremists" but never a list of Muslim extremists. Ironically, Maajid Nawaz and my wife both appeared on that list — until Maajid sued them.
Like the case of the Covington Catholic schoolboys — who were falsely accused of having insulted a Native American activist during a visit to Washington —the case of Jussie Smollett only serves to validate President Trump's insistence that it is liberals who propagate fake news. This is going to matter in the 2020 presidential election.
But the more profound consequence of fake hate crimes is to impede us from facing the complex realities of hatred itself.

Texto completo: Four Delaware State University students were injured in a crash that closed Del. 1 near Smyrna for four hours Saturday night, a DSU spokesman confirmed Tuesday.
The family of one of those students has alleged the crash was related to hazing, Fox 29 reported.
Family members told the news station that 23-year-old Marlon Jackson fell asleep at the wheel because the fraternity he's pledging — Kappa Alpha Psi — has been keeping him up late at night.
The students were reportedly running an errand for the fraternity when the crash took place. The family told Fox 29 that Jackson is being kept alive by a breathing device and that doctors have said he is brain dead.
The family was not immediately available for comment.
Delaware State University said in a statement Tuesday that it would be investigating "allegations of hazing and improper conduct in the membership intake processes of at least one Greek-letter organization on campus."
The statement from University President Wilma Mishoe and Executive Vice President Tony Allen said more immediately, Kappa Alpha Psi would not be allowed to participate in activities on campus:
"While completing this investigation, we have placed a hold on all activities for this organization in particular, and are also issuing an unequivocal statement to the entire campus community:
We are wholly committed to creating a campus that is welcoming to all students and supporting them in their academic and student life throughout their college years. Any action to the contrary will not be tolerated. To be clear, the University does not condone hazing or abusive conduct in any fashion, at any time."
DSU said its thoughts and prayers are with the students and their families.
Delaware State Police said they could not yet confirm the cause of the crash or release the identities of those involved.
After the crash, two people, one of whom the family identified as Jackson, were in critical condition, state police said Sunday.
The crash was reported just before 5 p.m., New Castle County Paramedics said on Facebook.
A 2007 Chevy Impala was traveling south, approaching the Del. 6 overpass, when it went into the grassy center median, according to state police.
It spun into the north lanes, directly into the path of a 2019 Toyota Tacoma pickup truck, police said. The front end of the Toyota struck the passenger side of the Chevy, and both vehicles came to a stop in the center of the road.
There were four men — now known to be the DSU students — in the Chevy, police said. The only person in the Tacoma was the driver, a man from Pennsylvania.
An off-duty New Castle County Paramedics sergeant who had just started his commute to work was one of the first on the scene, the department said on Facebook. He found the four DSU students trapped in the Impala.
He couldn't get to two of the students due to the extensive damage the vehicle had sustained. Additional units were dispatched, including New Castle County Paramedics and a Delaware State Police helicopter, following his report to the Kent County 911 center.
Jackson and the front-seat passenger were taken to Christiana Hospital in critical condition, according to state police.
One of the back-seat passengers was also taken to Christiana Hospital, while the other was taken to Kent General Hospital. They were both in stable condition.
The driver of the Toyota was taken to Christiana Hospital in stable condition.
Kappa Alpha Psi It is unclear if hazing is truly to blame for the crash. Jackson's girlfriend told Fox 29 that he had also been hit with paddles and canes, along with other hazing.
The national Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity does not tolerate hazing, according to its website, and has abolished pledging as a process for membership.
But hazing still happens and can be dangerous, if not deadly.
In 1994, a Kappa Alpha Psi was beaten to death as part of a hazing ritual at Southeast Missouri State University, according to the New York Times.
More recently, in 2016, three men with apparent ties to Kappa Alpha Psi at the University of Central Florida were beaten with canes during another apparent hazing incident, reported the Orlando Sentinel.
In Delaware, Kappa Alpha Psi has been praised for its work in the community. In Wilmington, the national fraternity has sponsored mentorship programs for students, awarded scholarships and more.
There is no mention of dangerous hazing by DSU's branch of Kappa Alpha Psi in The News Journal archives.
In 2008, however, a New Castle Student attending the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore was allegedly beaten so severely with wooden paddles and canes during two months of Kappa Alpha Psi hazing that he had to be hospitalized.
His wounds ultimately resulted in gangrene and part of his buttocks needed to be surgically removed.
At the time, DSU said it hoped the incident would encourage its members to embrace new, less-harmful ways of inducting new members.
Deadly Del. 1 There have been several serious crashes on Del. 1 involving cars that crossed the median into the opposite lanes of traffic.
In one, five members of the Trinidad family of New Jersey, including four children, were killed near Townsend in July 2018.
The Delaware Department of Transportation decided to install cable guardrails on Del. 1 from Odessa to Smyrna three months before the fatal crash involving the New Jersey family, it said.
Last month, DelDOT told The News Journal that construction had begun in Smyrna, in the Duck Creek area. Installation of the new guardrails is expected to be completed by December, DelDOT said.
In pictures from Sunday night's crash, there is no visible barrier in place.
"Where we're working right now is just north of there," DelDOT spokesman C.R. McLeod said, confirming that the crash site is outside the scope of the current project.
DelDOT documents show the new guardrails starting about half a mile north of Del 6. An ensuing project is supposed to install guardrail from just north of Del. 6 to Del. 9, according to DelDOT documents.
McLeod said that second phase includes the area where Sunday's night crash happened.
Installation will likely start next year, he said, though there's no official date yet.

A victim is taken to a waiting Delaware State Police helicopter after an accident on Del. 1 Saturday. The family of one student hurt in the crash told a television station that he has been declared brain dead.

Texto completo: Kenny Anderson, a celebrated point guard from Queens who had a 14-year N.B.A. career, was hospitalized over the weekend after suffering a stroke.
Lina Catalfamo Plath, a family spokeswoman, said via email that Anderson was recovering. Plath also released a statement from Anderson's wife, Natasha.
"We would like to thank everyone for reaching out on behalf of Kenny," Natasha Anderson said in the statement. "Our family is extremely grateful for all the prayers and love that we have received over the last few days. We appreciate you continuing to respect our privacy as Kenny heals."
Anderson, 48, recently concluded his first season as the men's basketball coach at Fisk University, a historically black school in Nashville that plays at the N.A.I.A. level.
As a high school player at Archbishop Molloy, a powerhouse program in Queens, Anderson was one of the most prolific and high-profile players in the city's rich basketball history. A McDonald's All-American, Anderson set what was then a state scoring record with 2,621 points before enrolling at Georgia Tech, where he helped the team reach the Final Four in 1990.
After Anderson spent two seasons at Georgia Tech, the New Jersey Nets made him the second overall pick in the 1991 N.B.A. draft -- Larry Johnson went first to the Charlotte Hornets -- and Anderson enjoyed a productive career that never quite lived up to the hype that had followed him since he was a teenager. He averaged 12.6 points and 6.1 assists a game while playing for nine teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Portland Trail Blazers, and was an All-Star selection for the Nets in 1994.
A 2017 documentary on Anderson called "Mr. Chibbs" detailed many of his personal struggles, including bankruptcy and depression. In 2014, he traveled to North Korea as a member of the team that Dennis Rodman, the former Chicago Bulls forward, cobbled together at the invitation of Kim Jong-un, the country's leader.
"My mistakes weren't really mistakes," Anderson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2011. "It was being young and living and learning. Yes, I spent a lot of money; I went through a lot of money. I had some failed marriages -- if you want to criticize me for that. You can't cry about your mishaps. I count my blessings, I don't count my mishaps."

Texto completo: The Scripps Howard Foundation announced today that three projects from ProPublica and the ProPublica Local Reporting Network are finalists for the Scripps Howard National Journalism Awards. The work was honored in the categories of human interest storytelling, environmental reporting and broadcast - national, international coverage.
“Blood Will Tell,” a two-part investigation jointly published by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine, was nominated for human interest storytelling. ProPublica senior reporter Pamela Colloff, also a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine, told the story of Joe Bryan, a beloved high school principal whose wife, Mickey, was shot to death in their Texas home in 1985. While not initially considered a suspect, Bryan was arrested and charged with her murder. The prosecution’s case rested largely on the testimony of a “bloodstain-pattern analyst,” a police detective whose interpretation of the bloodied evidence made the state’s circumstantial case against Bryan seem plausible.
Colloff’s series exposed the failings of bloodstain-pattern analysis, leading to real-life repercussions. Days after the article’s publication, the Texas Forensic Science Commission retained an independent expert to re-examine the bloodstain-pattern analysis used to convict Bryan. The commission found that the expert whose testimony helped secure the conviction was “entirely wrong,” and that his claims were “not accurate or scientifically supported.” The state’s case unraveled further when the expert admitted that his conclusions were incorrect. Texas’ highest criminal court is now considering whether to recommend that Bryan’s conviction be overturned.
A project from the ProPublica Local Reporting Network, by the Charleston Gazette-Mail and ProPublica, was nominated for environmental reporting. Led by Gazette-Mail reporter Ken Ward Jr., “The New Power Brokers” illuminated how the natural gas industry is gaining power in West Virginia as a strong economic and political force — and the real-life effects of the industry on communities. The series showed how the relentless traffic and noise from heavy machinery has made life unbearable for residents, especially for those who live closest to gas-drilling operations, and how landowners have been unable to stop gas companies from drilling right on their private property. The reporting also explained how regulatory agencies are bending their rules and looking past blatant violations.
“Documenting Hate,” a collaboration between ProPublica reporter A.C. Thompson and Frontline, was nominated in the category of broadcast - national, international coverage. The two-part documentary outed some of the most violent figures within America’s resurgent white supremacist movement, as well as the movement’s links to the U.S. military and governmental failures to curb the criminal activities of dangerous white power groups. The investigation identified former and active-duty members of the military as members of Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi group. Within weeks of the report, the U.S. Marine Corps announced that it had opened a criminal investigation into the activities of Lance Cpl. Vasillios Pistolis, whom the documentary identified as a violent white supremacist who took part in the Charlottesville, Virginia, demonstration in August 2017. Pistolis was later convicted at a court-martial on charges of disobeying orders and making false statements, and he was dismissed from the Marines.
ProPublica and Frontline also reported on the violent white supremacist Rise Above Movement. As a result, Michael Miselis, an aerospace engineer with a government security clearance identified as a member of RAM, was out of his job at defense contractor Northrop Grumman. In addition, citing ProPublica and Frontline’s reporting, federal prosecutors announced they had arrested or charged four members or associates of RAM — Robert Rundo, Robert Boman, Tyler Laube and Aaron Eason — over their alleged role in the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville.

This is how Jacob Wohl created a sexual harassment accusation against Robert Mueller

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – It was arguably one of the more bizarre news stories of last year. And it was all fake.
Special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possibly collusion with President Trump, was the target of a scheme where women were offered money to make up claims of sexual harassment against him.
The plot, which was quickly uncovered by reporters just days before the midterm elections in November, was referred to the FBI for investigation. But now, one of the two men allegedly behind the scheme opened up to USA TODAY about the plot and all the other ways he uses his platform to spread lies to the American public.
Jacob Wohl, a 21-year-old self-professed "political and corporate intel consultant" and supporter of President Donald Trump, told USA TODAY in an interview that he's already plotting ways to discredit Democrats in the 2020 election with lies and other disinformation, using his large following on social media to cause disarray similar to what Russians did during the 2016 election.

More: Robert Mueller asks FBI to review alleged sexual harassment hoax, his spokesman says
Twitter announced that it is permanently suspending Wohl following the publication of a USA TODAY article in which he boasted of using the social media platform to spread lies and disinformation.
Wohl said he was eager to correct the record on the Mueller episode, in which his apparent efforts to disgrace Trump’s foremost adversary ended up unraveling into somewhat of a joke.
It started with emails received by several news outlets in which the sender claimed an intelligence company had tried to pay her to accuse Mueller of sexual misdeeds. A professor produced emails showing that she had also been approached for information by the company.
Reporters followed a bizarre online trail to reveal that Wohl was behind the intelligence company, which seemed to be staffed by an office full of imagined employees.
Wohl and his partner in the episode, Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist Jack Burkman, then announced a news conference devolving into farce when a woman who they said was going to make allegations against Mueller didn’t show up.
The result of the Elmore Leonard-esque plot was a media cycle of ridicule for Wohl.

But, Wohl claimed to USA TODAY, however, that a goal of his scheme had been to trick journalists into thinking that he had offered to pay for dirt on Mueller, so he made up a person and sent those allegations to media outlets. On his phone, he scrolled through emails from reporters at major outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and Buzzfeed who had tried to garner more information from a person who he says did not actually exist.
He described these emails-- of reporters doing their due diligence-- as trophies from a logic-stretching plan that had as the ultimate goal getting reporters to go to a news conference at a D. C. -area Holiday Inn.
"The real allegations against Mueller would have been ignored … had we not roped the media into attending the press conference," Wohl said.
But those "real allegations" appear to be even more problematic. At the news conference, Wohl distributed a document that was digitally signed, purportedly by the absent accuser Carolyne Cass, in which she said she had been sexually assaulted by Mueller in New York in 2010. In the interview this month, Wohl referred to Cass as a "real accuser" and called her allegations credible.
But when reached by USA TODAY, 34-year-old Carolyne Cass of Los Angeles said Wohl, whom she met on Craigslist, had tricked her by pretending to be an investigator named Matthew Cohen who was trained by Israeli intelligence forces and agreed to help her with "unscrupulous characters ripping me off. "
Cass said she paid the man she knew as Cohen $2,000, for which he did no work but instead offered her the prospect of employment at his intelligence agency and had her speak on the phone to people whose identities she now believes Wohl fabricated.
Cass said it ultimately became clear that Cohen and his associates, imaginary or otherwise, “needed a credible female to put on the line” for false allegations about Mueller. “They made it up,” Cass said of the document accusing Mueller, which was passed around at the news conference. “They wrote it and docu-signed it. ”
She claimed Cohen tried to get her to speak at the news conference but she “escaped” and learned only as the scheme exploded that Cohen was in fact Wohl. “He completely lied to me,” Cass said.
Wohl had as recently as this month referred to Cass while speaking in detail about the Mueller episode. But when asked about Cass’s version of events, Wohl said he could not speak further because he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with her and “can’t violate any confidences. ” Cass said no such agreement existed.
Burkman also refused to discuss his role in the Mueller scheme. Both Wohl and Cass say they have not been contacted by the FBI.
Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg said Wohl’s actions could be construed by a federal prosecutor as wire fraud, obstruction of justice or conspiracy – or as possibly violating various state statutes – but likely fell into a legal “gray zone. ”
“The whole thing smacks of illegality and nefariousness and deception, but it still needs to have an anchor in criminal statute,” Weisberg said.

Texto completo: When Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently announced that his state would scale back its failing high-speed rail project, President Trump demanded that California return the $2.5 billion in federal funds already provided.
The president also said the Transportation Department would terminate a $929 million federal grant supporting the project. Originally projected to cost $40 billion, the high-speed rail was more recently projected at $37 billion over budget, at least four years delayed in sections and had already cost taxpayers $4 billion. Whether the federal government will be able to recoup money it pledged for the project is unclear, but that question misses the broader point: I fear America is unable to do anything big.
What happened in California is just the latest example of our inability to complete big economic projects. Last year, a multiyear effort to build a nuclear power plant in South Carolina was abandoned, declaring an end to what The New York Times described as "a project that was once expected to showcase advanced nuclear technology but has since been plagued by delays and cost overruns." Construction on the plant was shut down with less than 40 percent built at a cost of roughly $9 billion, and overruns led to an eventual projected cost of up to $25 billion to complete the project, over twice the initial estimate.
In 2017, work on the Port of Savannah in Georgia came to a halt when it was discovered that deepening the port to accommodate newer, larger vessels coming through the Panama Canal would cost "38 percent more and take two years longer to complete than initially expected," the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Our politicians talk about imports and exports, but we can't even have our ports keep pace with the size of ships that are facilitating trade around the world.
And don't even get me started about the private sector's plight in trying to overcome all the nails that can be thrown in their path - mostly by Democratic politicians and activists. How do Democrats reconcile the Green New Deal's call for "guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security" while some opposed the 25,000 new jobs that Amazon would have brought to New York City? Exactly what kind of jobs and what kind of pay are Democrats guaranteeing for everyone? Where will everyone work? (Amazon's founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Washington Post.)
Just last week, former Vice President Al Gore suggested that Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam could atone for having worn blackface in the 1980s by fighting to oppose the $7.5 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Really? Somehow, Virginians will feel better about Northam or Northam will feel better about himself if this megaproject is disrupted? What will Northam's absolution cost the commonwealth? (Disclosure: My firm represents interests in the fossil-fuel industry.)
Democrats claim to support infrastructure, but they are responsible for crafting the regulations and encouraging nongovernmental organizations and activists that derail those investments, which lead to higher costs and the further erosion of the United States' economic potential. The result? We are spending more than ever, but we are not building assets. Natural gas shortages are plaguing New York. Significant vulnerabilities are emerging for New England's electric grid. We are creating self-induced chokepoints for our exports at U.S. ports.
Beyond a list of giveaways - including everything from free college to a growing call for reparations - Democrats do not have a serious economic message. Maybe they can start by defining what infrastructure they would, in fact, support.

Personal responsibility is not racist, and Barack Obama is no race traitor for endorsing it

Texto completo: Writing for the New York Times on Saturday, Harvard Law graduate Derecka Purnell derided former President Barack Obama as a race betrayer. Obama's challenging of young black men to take more responsibility for their own better lives, Purnell says, makes "clear Mr. Obama’s chains still bind him."

Purnell's implication: By speaking on race outside of a priority focus on victimhood, Obama is a slave to racism.

Sorry, but it's clear that Purnell is the only one making a racist argument here. We see this in her fallacious attempts to present Obama as a servant to white injustices.

"Black families were hit the hardest during the financial crisis," Purnell says, while ignoring the unprecedented economic benefits they have enjoyed under the Trump administration. Purnell laments that Obama condemned protesters in Ferguson and Baltimore who were "resisting police violence with rocks, not the police officers whom the protesters were rightly defending themselves against." Referencing one study, but ignoring other statistics which speak to the devastating effects of mass out of wedlock births in the black community, Purnell is aggravated that Obama "criticized absent fathers." Obama is apparently even immoral when it comes to professional deportment: "Rather than encouraging them to dismantle the systems that deepen wealth inequality, Mr. Obama tells black boys to tuck their chains."

This is a triumph of emotional, unfair analysis. Whatever one thinks of the police conduct at Baltimore and Ferguson, is there any doubt that innocents were harmed by some protesters, businesses burned, and police officers attacked? Is there seriously any doubt that too many black children don't see their fathers enough? Is there any doubt that it's better to wear a suit to an interview rather than chains or a backwards baseball cap? Of course there isn't.

But Purnell doesn't simply say it is immoral to articulate these realities; she says its racial treason . She presents Obama as a slave to the system. In doing so, Purnell does exactly that which she claims to oppose: she endorses a racist trope. She promotes the idea that challenging victimhood as the primary mechanism for social change is an act of racial treason — a choice by black Americans to "still bind" themselves to the chains.

Purnell is badly wrong. Whatever you think of Obama's politics or presidency, he is no slave to white orthodoxy. What's more, there is nothing "white" about personal responsibility. Purnell embraces racism when she claims as much.

Putin's Main Weapon: The 'Intelligence State'

Texto completo: According to this year's National Intelligence Worldwide Threat Assessment and Senate testimony by top-ranked intelligence officials, Americans can expect Vladimir Putin's Russia to continue its efforts to aggravate social, political and racial tensions in the United States and among its allies.
So, to best prepare for future Russian assaults, we should look to the past and study the mind-set of the Cold War K.G.B. -- the intelligence service in which President Putin spent his formative years. The history of the brutal Soviet security services lays bare the roots of Russia's current use of political arrests, subversion, disinformation, assassination, espionage and the weaponization of lies. None of those tactics is new to the Kremlin.
In fact, those tactics made Soviet Russia the world's first "intelligence state," and they also distinguished it from authoritarian states run by militaries. Today's Russia has become even more of an intelligence state after Mr. Putin's almost 20-year tenure as its strongman. In the U.S.S.R., the party ruled. It was only after the rise in the 1980s of Yuri Andropov -- Mr. Putin's role model and mentor -- that the K.G.B. became the state's most important institution. Then, a decade after the Soviet Union fell, Mr. Putin rose to power and recruited many of his former K.G.B. colleagues to help rebuild the state. The result is a regime with the policies and philosophy of a supercharged secret police service, a regime that relies on intelligence operations to deal with foreign policy challenges and maintain control at home.
Mr. Putin and his cronies had thrived in an empire where the K.G.B. was the sword and shield of the state, so they regularly return to their tried-and-true weapons when dealing with 21st-century problems. The intelligence services have even been used to covertly drug Russia's Olympic and Paralympic athletes -- the mark of an ultimate "intelligence state."
How did this start? After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, Vladimir Lenin established a secret police service called the Cheka to be his main weapon of repression and terror. Under Felix Dzerzhinsky, a ruthless revolutionary, the Cheka was tasked with keeping the leadership in power at all costs. It served as judge, jury and executioner for the state, using sabotage, censorship, repression and murder to keep the population in line and external enemies at bay.
As Dzerzhinsky remarked, "We stand for organized terror," and "the Cheka is obliged to defend the revolution and conquer the enemy even if its sword does by chance sometimes fall upon the heads of the innocent."
During Dzerzhinsky's time, monarchists, socialists, White Russians and outsiders all conspired to overthrow Lenin and the Bolshevik government. The main underground resistance bringing these forces together was the Monarchist Union of Central Russia, which operated secretly throughout Europe and inside the Soviet Union.
But unbeknown to those in that organization, it was a trap -- a full-fledged honey pot created by the Cheka to draw in enemies of the Soviet Union so they could be identified, neutralized and killed. This fledgling secret police service hoodwinked the established intelligence services of Europe, and in so doing showed its guile, patience and cruelty. Britain's "Ace of Spies," Sidney Reilly, who became Ian Fleming's model for James Bond, was just the most famous individual to be lured to the Soviet Union, interrogated and executed. Misplaced trust became a model for a century of Soviet and Russian subversive efforts, and the Cheka remained a source of pride for future Russian intelligence operatives. Indeed, Russian intelligence officers -- including Mr. Putin -- still celebrate Chekist Day every Dec. 20.
Over the decades, the Soviet and Russian secret services developed tools and habits based on their Chekist experience that set them apart from their counterparts in the West. Rather than focusing on collecting and analyzing intelligence, they developed expertise in propaganda, agitation, subversion, repression, deception and murder.
Indeed, the first senior defector from the new Bolshevik state, Boris Bajanov, fled to British India in 1928 with assassins on his tail. Bajanov, Stalin's personal secretary, reported that the Kremlin's primary foreign policy was to use covert means to weaken its enemies from within, so that if war came, it would be easier to win.
The Cheka and its successors sowed chaos abroad with propaganda, disinformation and sabotage while managing mass arrests and gulags at home. Bajanov added that Soviet cultural and diplomatic institutions were simply cover mechanisms meant to hoodwink Western intellectuals, foment commercial and political unrest and undermine democracies from within. In other words, their purpose was to throw dust in the eyes of educated people in the West. Over the years, defector after defector came to the West with the same story.
Indeed, the Kremlin deployed an army of spies and recruited informants around the world to steal secrets, spread disinformation and support terrorists and rogue regimes. The security services built their hybrid warfare on a form of deception called "reflexive control" -- an effort to manage the perceptions of adversaries so they would be fooled into acting against their own interests. The method included distracting, exhausting and confusing opponents in order to ultimately control their animating narrative. "Operation Infektion" was one such worldwide disinformation effort. Its goal was to spread the story that the virus that caused AIDS was a weapon the Pentagon had designed to destroy developing countries. The Russian operation to influence the 2016 American presidential election was a more recent example.
Assassination, too, is nothing new. When he arrived in the West, Bajanov explained that the Soviet leadership would send assassins to kill anyone who knew the true nature of the Kremlin's inner workings. This practice has continued. The unsuccessful 2018 Russian attempt to murder Sergei Skripal in Britain is almost indistinguishable from the Cold War K.G.B. assassination of the Ukrainian nationalist Stepan Bandera in 1959. Assassins covertly tracked Bandera to his Munich address and used a K.G.B.-manufactured gun that sprayed poison to make Bandera's death appear to have been a heart attack. It was only a K.G.B. assassin's eventual defection years later that revealed the truth.
As the United States seeks to engage Russia, it must realize that the Kremlin tiger will not change its stripes. Russia's efforts to forcefully defend itself stem from a profound sense of insecurity, bred from centuries of invasions and breakdowns of the state. Few countries have suffered more. So a central element of Russia's statecraft since the days of the czars has been deceiving and weakening its enemies from within. In that sense, Russia's well-sharpened tools of political tradecraft are explainable and logical, even though condemnable.
Western unity is our best defense. Mr. Putin seems to know he cannot compete with the West on a level playing field. He wields his Chekist fog machine to bewilder, confuse and paralyze his enemies because it is all he has. And as long as our politics are tribal, and Americans see domestic political opponents as the real enemy, the Kremlin's efforts to leverage and exploit our weaknesses will continue.
We should avoid threatening Russia's sovereignty and instead work with our allies to defend ourselves vigorously and in unison from cyber, physical and hybrid attacks, and push back when threatened.
This being the case, President Trump's anti-European sentiments are surely his greatest gift to President Putin.

'Dragon' Sits Atop The Box Office

Texto completo: Maybe the studios just needed a dragon this whole time.
After several lackluster weeks at the box office, many have wondered when things would pick up this year. A step in the right direction came this weekend: Audiences turned "How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World" into a bona fide hit.
The third installation of Universal's animated dragon series sold $55.5 million in tickets, exceeding most analysts' expectations and giving the franchise the best opening weekend of any of its three movies.
That figure is especially impressive given that the latest (and supposedly final) "Dragon" installment had a slightly lower budget than either of the previous movies -- about $129 million, against $165 million for the original (2010) and $145 for the second (2014), according to Box Office Mojo.
Also notable: The two best opening weekends this year have both been for the final installments of trilogies. Until this weekend, M. Night Shyamalan's "Glass" held the top spot. That superhero thriller opened last month to about $41 million in its first weekend.
The latest "Dragon" likely benefited from a lack of competition -- it was the only newcomer in the box office's top five this week -- and strong reviews (it currently holds a 91% "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes). Big-name voices probably helped, too: The series features Cate Blanchett and Gerard Butler as the parents of its protagonist, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel). Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig and the "Game of Thrones" star Kit Harington lent their pipes to lesser roles (though Ben Kenigsberg, in his review for The New York Times, wrote that you suspect some of the actors "stopped by the recording studio only briefly").
[Read our critic's review of "How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World."]
There's a gulf in sales between "Dragon" and this weekend's second-place movie: Fox's "Alita: Battle Angel" brought in just $12 million this weekend according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. That's not a great second-week showing for a film that cost roughly $170 million to make. Since opening, the Robert Rodriguez-directed movie has grossed an estimated $60.7 million domestically.
Landing in fourth place, after "The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part" grabbed third, was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Fighting With My Family," the comedic drama based on the life of the professional wrestler Saraya-Jade Bevis (known as Paige and played here by Florence Pugh). It opened in Los Angeles and New York earlier this month, but it got its first taste of nationwide ticket sales this weekend, bringing in about $8 million.
That's respectable for a movie that had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival just last month and, according to The Hollywood Reporter, was produced for only about $11 million. The fact that Dwayne Johnson was a producer probably didn't hurt.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: America’s major book publishers are based in New York and California, with some educational publishers in Boston and Christian publishers in Wheaton, Ill., Grand Rapids, Mich., and Nashville.
But for the past two decades, publishing executives from around the country have made regular pilgrimages to Colorado Springs to confer with literary agents at Alive, a powerhouse agency that helped transform how Christian books are acquired and created.
From the Left Behind novels co-written by Black Forest writer Jerry Jenkins (70 million combined U.S. sales), to Eugene Peterson’s Message Bible (which has sold 20 million copies for NavPress, the publishing arm of the Springs-based ministry The Navigators), authors represented by Alive have sold more than 250 million books and earned 15 coveted No. 1 rankings on The New York Times bestseller lists.
Alive’s founder, Rick Christian, graduated from Stanford, started writing for newspapers and magazines, and wrote books, including a bestselling youth devotional book called Alive, before he came to a conclusion.
“I realized I could either be a broke author or a broker of authors,” he said in a recent interview at his Black Forest home.
Now, after 30 years, Christian is passing the baton to new owner/agents Bryan Norman and Lisa Jackson, top editors he recruited from Nelson and Tyndale.
Christian, who turned 65 in December, began thinking about retirement eight years ago after a series of personal crises. He fell backward while climbing rocks in Grand Lake, breaking his back and pelvis. Then Lee Hough, the agent he hoped would succeed him in leading Alive, died from brain cancer. About the same time, he believed his wife, Debbie, was dying in his arms when she suffered a grand mal seizure — the first sign of a brain tumor that later was removed.
“It became more clear that there’s an expiration period on this life as we know it,” he said.
‘Righteous indignation’
Christian, who came to faith in Christ through a Campus Life club, founded Alive in 1989 in California and moved his family and agency to Colorado Springs in 1991.
“What a fabulous city,” he said. “This move was one of smarter things I’ve done, allowing us to raise our kids climbing trees, skiing, boating, fishing.”
His first major client was former San Francisco Giants pitcher Dave Dravecky, who followed Alive to the Springs, basing his Outreach of Hope ministry here before returning to California.
Christian soon found he could fight harder for other writers than he had for himself.
“I got hosed as an author because Christian publishers had a virtual monopoly over the intellectual property created by their authors, without pushback from agents,” he says. “But when I negotiated for another author, something got lit inside me, and I negotiated with righteous indignation.”
“Agents are a way for nice-guy writers to stay nice guys and have someone advocating for them,” said Jerry Jenkins, who worked with Alive for many years.
In time, publishers’ contracts with authors grew longer and more sophisticated, and writers began earning a bigger share of publishers’ profits. Alive changed the power balance in Christian publishing, helping writers but earning the enmity of publishers who claimed Christian prioritized money over ministry.
“Once I hung out my shingle, publishers didn’t respond well,” he said. Some accused him of trying to claim too many pieces of publishing’s revenue pie. One even told Christian not to have any contact with the house’s authors.
Passing the baton
Over the years, Christian has seen Christian ministry and business leaders fail to prepare their successors to succeed.
“Some of these guys are wired so tightly they just can’t let go of the reins,” he said.
He determined to take a different route. Three years ago, he hired a retirement adviser, began working on the transition with Norman and Jackson, stopped attending agent meetings, and placed a backpack and walking stick in his office to symbolize his upcoming departure. He will consult with Alive for the next few years.
There were times of tears as he went through three decades worth of documents and memorabilia, but he says he never questioned that “this was the right thing at the right time.”
“I am grateful I could spend the bulk of my working years doing what I love with people I adore, realize my dreams, and accomplish the tasks with which I was entrusted,” he said in a news release announcing his retirement.
He’s leaving the industry at a time of continuing upheaval, particularly in retailing. Amazon “came out of the blue like a devastating rogue wave,” he said, mowing down Christian stores as it did big retailers such as Borders and B. Dalton.
In 2017, Family Christian, the biggest Christian retail chain, closed its remaining 240 stores. This January, Southern Baptist publisher LifeWay announced it would begin closing some of its 174 brick-and-mortar stores. And digital publishing enables authors to self-publish books without Christian publishers.
The bloodletting is affecting CBA, the Colorado Springs-based trade association for Christian retail founded in 1950. CBA has cut staff and failed to meet some of its financial obligations, according to Publishers Weekly.
“Booksellers may disappear, but books will live as long as life exists, because storytelling is hard-wired into our DNA,” Christian says.
Now that he is freed from having to read and analyze several dozen manuscripts a month, he again is reading for pleasure, including C.S. Lewis’ Narnia chronicles and some of the dozen-plus titles he oversaw for the Rev. Eugene Peterson, a dear friend who died last year.
“Instead of constantly swimming upstream against deadlines, finances and other pressures, I need some time to sit on the bank and watch the river flow,” he said.
He has even started writing again, working on a long-delayed family memoir. He also has volunteered with Springs Rescue Mission and attends New Life Downtown, a congregation of New Life Church.
“I want a season to clean my heart and my head, let things bubble up from around me, and look for that next assignment,” he said.
Asked how he thinks God views his decades in publishing, he was reflective.
“I don’t think the numbers or the bigness of the industry matter to God,” Christian says, sitting in a home office decorated with plaques celebrating his 15 trips to the top of the Times’ bestseller list.
“Christ could be surrounded by crowds, but he would turn his attention from the thousands to Zacchaeus, one little guy up in a tree. That was his focus.
“I think the most important thing is what did you do with the things you are entrusted with. Alive was God’s gift. I worked really hard at it, but ultimately it was God’s gift to me.”

Resumen: About 15 middle- and high school students in the San Francisco Bay area met with Feinstein on Friday, asking the six-term senator whether she would vote for the ambitious climate change proposal introduced earlier this month by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts. An edited video of their meeting was shared on social media by the Sunrise Movement, a self-described "army of young people" striving to elect leadership who will address the urgent nature of climate change, according to their website. The children responded by pointing to military funding, and then argued for drastic action as some scientists estimate the world has just over 10 years to address climate change before its effects are irreversible.

Texto completo: An exchange between Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and a group of schoolchildren petitioning her to advocate for the "Green New Deal" went viral, drawing criticism and prompting a response from the senator.

About 15 middle- and high school students in the San Francisco Bay area met with Feinstein on Friday, asking the six-term senator whether she would vote for the ambitious climate change proposal introduced earlier this month by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts. An edited video of their meeting was shared on social media by the Sunrise Movement, a self-described "army of young people" striving to elect leadership who will address the urgent nature of climate change, according to their website. The group also posted an unedited version of the video on its Facebook page.

Feinstein told the gaggle of students that she doesn't support the deal, mainly because there is "no way to pay for it."

The Sunrise Movement, which The New York Times notes has held protests and rallies this week aimed at Democrats who have not voiced their support of the Green New Deal, later said they found Feinstein's tone toward the young children to be callous.

"But we have come to a point where our Earth is dying, and it is literally a pricey and ambitious plan that is needed to deal with the magnitude of that issue," a 16-year-old student replied. "So we're asking you to vote ‘yes' on the resolution for the Green New Deal because -"

The senator interrupted, "That resolution will not pass the Senate. And you can take that back to whoever sent you here." She added, "I've been in the Senate for a quarter of a century, and I know what can pass, and I know what can't pass."

Feinstein noted how the plan lacks support from Republicans, who control the Senate. She also discussed her own climate change legislation, which she claimed rivals the Green New Deal and has a "much better chance of passing." She offered to provide copies for each child and asked them to review it and let her know if they see issues.

The children responded by pointing to military funding, and then argued for drastic action as some scientists estimate the world has just over 10 years to address climate change before its effects are irreversible.

"Any plan that doesn't take bold, transformative action is not going to be what we need," one young woman said.

"Well you know better than I do, so I think one day you should run for the Senate." Feinstein responded. "Then you can do it your way."

The senator also touted her years of experience, at one point noting the children in the room were not old enough to vote for her.

"You know what's interesting about this group is I've been doing this for 30 years. I know what I'm doing," Feinstein said. "You come in here and say, it has to my way or the highway. I don't respond to that."

She did not say definitively which way she'd vote on the deal, telling one student she could support the measure. "I may do that, we'll see," she said. "I don't know."

Republicans have attacked the Green New Deal, asserting it reeks of socialism, as The Post's Salvador Rizzo notes. In a tweet earlier this month, President Donald Trump likened the proposal to permanently eliminating "all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil Gas & the Military." (The Post's Fact Checker said this is untrue.)

Some Democrats have also expressed skepticism of the deal, which calls for 100 percent clean electricity and projects to reduce carbon emissions across the United States. The Post's Dino Grandoni reported that "fault lines within the Democratic caucus were already visible" the day the bill was introduced, "with some members urging caution about setting vague and, at times, impossible-to-achieve goals to only fall short."

Several Democratic presidential candidates, however, have endorsed it, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The abridged version of the video posted to Twitter on Friday evening by the Sunrise Movement quickly went viral, amassing nearly 6 million views by Saturday morning. That video underscored some of the more fiery remarks Feinstein made and was posted with the caption, "This is how @SenFeinstein reacted to children asking her to support the #GreenNewDeal resolution - with smugness + disrespect."

"This is a fight for our generation's survival. Her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress," they wrote.

The two videos have given rise to many interpretations of Feinstein's interaction with the children. Some agreed with the Sunrise Movement's claim that was short and dismissive of the students. Others found the negative reaction to the her comments as unreasonable, especially after watching the full video.

Feinstein issued a response late Friday, writing in a tweet she and the group had a "spirited discussion" and that she'd listened to the young children who lobbied in her office. Toward the end of the longer video, the senator is seen speaking with one of the students about a potential internship opportunity.

"Unfortunately, it was a brief meeting, but I want to the children to know they were heard loud and clear," Feinstein wrote. "I have been and remain committed to doing everything I can to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation."

Women are living happy, longer lives

Texto completo: While recently reading the book review section of The New York Times, I came across a review by Emily Eakin of the nonfiction book "Women Rowing North: Navigating Life's Currents and Flourishing as We Age" by Mary Pipher. The line, "contrary to cultural scripts that say older women are old and useless when in reality they are the happiest demographic in the country," hit me squarely in the eye. Research cited from UCSD in California and census data from the United Kingdom suggest women 65 to 79 are the happiest people.
This deserves further thought. However, we need not look further than the number of high-profile women past the age of 70 who definitely are not useless.
Yes, women are living longer. We are healthier thanks to better medical facilities, which offer procedures for better mobility and medications to combat chronic conditions, thus giving us permission to participate in life's many offerings.
More women are part of the medical establishment and have worked tirelessly to enable women to enjoy their later years.
Better health produces better feelings and can cause us to want to be part of a growing society where older women are sought after for their institutional and historical knowledge, plus a maturity and desire to excel. As women age, the challenges of motherhood are erased.
The gift of solitude is a part of our lives. Noise is not needed to feel fulfilled. We are our own source of entertainment.
Perhaps after years of caregiving for her own children, grandchildren, husband and/or parents, a woman can peer outside the window and into her psyche and discover she can fulfill earlier pursuits or begin new ones.
We are resourceful and resilient. We are also nurturers, which, when caregiving ends, can lead to feelings of loss. We can and should acknowledge the loss knowing we listened to the call and did our best.
The past several years have seen many versions of exercise geared toward women.
Yoga classes have been designed for women of all physical and mental capabilities. As we all know, meditation is paramount to any yoga class. Through this discipline, women can, in a quiet atmosphere, meet themselves and others. Walking, running, aerobics or anything physical brings a natural smile, which helps us to look happy.
Unable to complete higher education after high school? Well, post-retirement is ideal. Perhaps you want to pursue the dream of achieving a degree. Or perhaps you just want an opportunity to enjoy a course in a field of interest. An online curriculum can satisfy one's appetite for that degree. Many colleges and universities have adult education classes - the offerings are many and affordable. Keeping the mind active is crucial for smiles and satisfaction, two ingredients of contentment.
Besides the new possibilities and challenges available by the time we are in our mid-60s, we have suffered the loss of at least one loved one. We know the sting. Grief has walked with us. We've learned and embraced our own coping methods.
We recognize that grief and healing are inseparable and universal. The feelings are never conquered. But whenever a loved one dies, we have memories to help us. In her novel, Pipher counsels, "Grief isn't something to endure. It also is a reflection of our capacity to love."
How 65 to 79 became the happiest demographic for women is fodder for further study.

Three hundred years ago, a group of sixteen Scots-Irish families established a settlement in Nutfield (later Londonderry). They were part of a wave of Scots-Irish immigration to New England that would bring thousands of people to the New World. In New Hampshire, the Londonderry settlement became a jumping-off point for what was essentially a Scots-Irish invasion in the eighteenth century. Scots-Irish settlers would become the largest minority group in the colony and would introduce the potato to America. Join us for a day-long program with special guest speakers from the Ulster Historical Foundation from Belfast, Ireland, to learn more about the history of the Scots-Irish and conducting genealogical research on Scots-Irish families. Time will also be set aside for Q&A and for some tips on overcoming brick walls in your research. In addition, the Society will present for viewing, for one day only, the Shute Petition, which initiated the Scots-Irish exodus to New England. Space is limited, and registration is required. Make your discoveries on March 9 from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the New Hampshire Historical Society, 30 Park St. Tickets are $75 to $139.

There will also be a chance to win prizes and raise money for Families in Transition-New Horizons. Tickets are $50.
Amid the discouraging headlines, societal troubles, and global turmoil, one local organization is making a difference by promoting and doing acts of kindness. The nonprofit organization's mission is to promote community and hope through community-driven acts of kindness and financial assistance to local community members in need. When there is a need for a family or an organization, Hearts for Kindness posts a “community call to action” to collect the items needed. Families or individuals who are faced with unexpected circumstances can request through a third party for financial assistance up to $500 to help with emergency expenses that can throw off a household budget for months. Hearts for Kindness wants to encourage kindness for everyone. The most recent Kindness Hero recipient was Jessica Livingston, owner of JLiv Inspirations and director of the Concord Multicultural Festival. She was named a Kindness Hero for her “diligent and selfless work of promoting diversity and inclusion, and giving voice to the under-represented members of the community.”

Not on the Vatican Agenda, but on Participants' Minds: Homosexuality

Texto completo: Called to the Vatican this week by Pope Francis to grapple with the crisis of child sexual abuse by clergy, nearly 200 leaders of the Roman Catholic Church sat for lectures on responsibility, accountability and transparency.
But privately, they kept raising one issue not on the agenda: homosexuality.
"We spoke of this," Bishop Ricardo Ernesto Centellas Guzmán, the president of the Bolivian Bishops Conference, acknowledged on Thursday, the start of the extraordinary four-day meeting of bishops and other church leaders.
Yet homosexuality is exactly the topic the conference organizers had hoped to avoid, pointing to ample research finding no connection between homosexuality and pedophilia.
"The main issue is power," said the Rev. Hans Zollner, a member of the Vatican's child-protection commission and president of the Center for Child Protection of the Pontifical Gregorian University.
Abuse "can be heterosexual or homosexual," he added in an interview.
Still, some Catholic bishops and conservative church media outlets have continued to blame the clerical child sexual abuse crisis on homosexuality.
At the meeting, even as organizers and attendees pushed time and again to focus the discussions on pedophilia, the conflicting views about homosexuality within the church emerged as a distraction.
Jean-Claude Hollerich, the archbishop of Luxembourg and Bishops' Conferences of the European Union, moderated one of the meeting's French-speaking discussion groups, which included leaders from some Francophone African nations.
He said on Saturday that some bishops kept returning to homosexuality as a cause for abuse because "some people have some models in their head and they will always keep to it."
He said he and other bishops had sought to change their minds.
"I tell them the prime minister of my country is homosexual," he said. "And he would never abuse children."
Bishop Rochus Josef Tatamai, of Kavieng, president of the Bishops' Conference of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, said on Saturday that in his English-language group, homosexuality was "alluded to" during discussions about the training of new priests.
He suggested that "a desperate need for priests" in Europe and the United States had led seminaries to be lax in screening for candidates, some of whom turned out to be gay and abusers.
Pope Francis has clearly shifted the discussion, if not church doctrine, to a more inclusive position on homosexuality.
In 2013, he responded to questions about a supposed "gay lobby" in the Vatican by saying, "Who am I to judge?" -- a remark that liberals celebrated and conservatives lamented.
But while Catholic Church teachings state that people with homosexual tendencies "must be accepted with respect," it also calls deep-seated homosexual inclinations and acts "intrinsically disordered."
Some conservative American prelates have sought to bring down Francis, seeing him as a protector of a gay subculture that is corrupting the clergy. Some have said his positions are eroding the church's traditional values and planting the seeds of sexual abuse.
Bishops from Africa, Asia and Latin America say that in failing to connect homosexuality to sexual abuse, the Vatican is ignoring that a vast majority of abuse is perpetrated by priests on male victims.
This view has been echoed by Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the church's chief doctrinal watchdog until Pope Francis forced him out in 2017.
The cardinal told the German magazine Der Spiegel this month that "far more than 80 percent of the victims of sexual abuse under 18 years of age were young men in puberty or post-puberty."
And he argued that homosexuality should have been a central topic at the Vatican meeting this week.
Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago, a favorite of Pope Francis and an organizer of the conference, said on Monday that it was not the case that "homosexual people are more prone to abuse children than straight people."
Asked about Cardinal Müller's remarks, Cardinal Cupich told reporters "it's important to admit the fact" that the predominance of underage victims are male. But he pointed to landmark studies in the United States and Australia showing that homosexuality in itself is not a cause of child sex abuse, and that access to children is a major factor.
Each day at the meeting, reporters from conservative Catholic news outlets peppered the meeting's organizers with questions about why they are dodging the topic of homosexuality.
Their short answer: because it is irrelevant.
Homosexuality has "nothing to do with the sexual abuse of minors," Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, the Vatican's leading sex crimes investigator, said on Friday.
Still, leading conservatives and traditionalists persisted in their arguments.
Cardinal Raymond Burke of the United States and Cardinal Walter Brandmüller of Germany published an open letter to the presidents of bishops' conferences representing various countries at the meeting, urging them to end their "conspiracy of silence" about the "plague of the homosexual agenda."
And Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, a former papal ambassador to the United States who accused the pope in August of protecting abusive gay clerics and called for his resignation, argued on Thursday that it was fitting that the meeting's opening that day coincided with the feast of St. Peter Damian, an 11th-century monk who fought against "sins of sodomy" in the church.
(Some church historians cautioned the archbishop that the saint was perhaps not the best model, as he had also denounced as immoral a Byzantine princess for introducing the practice of eating with a fork.)
The conference coincided with what appeared to be the strategically timed release of "In the Closet of the Vatican," a gossipy book by the French author Frédéric Martel, who characterized the Vatican as "one of the biggest gay communities in the world."
Those who attack Pope Francis "are very homophobic and for the large part live a double homosexual life," Mr. Martel said Wednesday at a news conference in Rome, adding that as a gay man, he was able to determine who in the Vatican was gay.
The book's release was criticized by advocates for abuse victims.
"Let's be clear," said Peter Saunders, a Briton who was forced off the Vatican's child protection panel for criticizing it as toothless. "There is no link between people who are gay and people who abuse children. And I think that that is a lie that has to be hammered into the ground."
Estimates of how many priests are gay vary widely, but at a minimum, it is considered to be a significant percentage. One priest in Florida recently told The New York Times that a third of Catholic clergy members were gay, a third were straight, and a third remained a mystery -- even to themselves.
Some advocates for gay equality in the church said their message seemed to have gotten through to church leaders.
Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry in Maryland, a Catholic organization that supports gay men and lesbians, said in Rome that he was pleasantly surprised at the conference to find homosexuality "debunked as a cause" of abuse. He was hoping the Vatican "would give a more definitive, official statement from the pope to that effect."
But among the bishops in the room with Francis, the issue was not exactly settled.
Entering the conference, Bishop Gonzalo de Villa y Vásquez of Guatemala said, "I think it can be a legitimate question whether or not there is a link between homosexuality and abuses."
Pope Francis, asked in 2013 about a "gay lobby" at the Vatican, responded, "Who am I to judge?" (PHOTOGRAPH BY VINCENZO PINTO/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS)

Pot legalization not the answer

Texto completo: Pantagraph readers wouldnt know this based on a recent editorial, but cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses, and among regular users it is likely to increase the risk for developing social anxiety disorder, according to a 2017 review from the National Academy of Medicine.
According to a 2018 paper published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, people who used cannabis in 2001 were almost three times as likely to use opiates three years later. Another study, released in Australia, cited that patients with chronic pain who used cannabis experienced even greater pain over time.
Alex Berenson, a former New York Times reporter, recently released a book that has exposed the marijuana lobby and its decades-long march toward marijuana legalization.
Berensons book, Tell Your Children: The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence, crushes the narrative that pot is an innocuous drug and a virtual panacea for all that ails you.
Berensons reporting offers a thoroughly researched counterpoint to the growing chorus of legalization advocates. We need not look further than Colorado to see a cautionary tale of the unintended consequences of legalization: meager tax revenues, increased rates in marijuana-related emergency room visits, traffic deaths, and violent crime.
Devastatingly, more than a fourth of Colorados middle and high school students use pot more than once daily. Legalization is not the answer for Illinois, unless the goal is to compromise the future of our youth and the safety of our citizenry.

Trump comparte un viejo video de reparación de cercas como su nuevo “muro” en la frontera

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump está fingiendo que el video de una cerca que se reparó hace 5 meses prueba que su “muro” se está construyendo en este momento, reporta Task and Purpose.
La mentira es la última humillación de Trump, a quien se le ha negado repetidamente la posibilidad de gastar miles de millones de dólares del presupuesto en el proyecto del muro en la frontera sur de Estados Unidos.
Trump primero compartió el video el miércoles en su cuenta de Twitter. “Acabamos de construir este poderoso Muro en Nuevo México”, escribió el presidente. “Completado el 30 de enero de 2019, ¡47 días antes de lo previsto! ¡Muchas millas más ahora en construcción!
Y usó la etiqueta #FinishTheWall (#TerminenElMuro)
We have just built this powerful Wall in New Mexico. Completed on January 30, 2019 – 47 days ahead of schedule! Many miles more now under construction! #FinishTheWall pic.twitter.com/TYkj3KRdOC
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2019
Y luego el jueves:
THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW! https://t.co/exUJCiITsz
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2019
El gran problema es que las imágenes que está transmitiendo como nuevas, son en realidad trabajos de reparación a estructuras existentes realizados hace cinco meses.
Nuevamente, a pesar de la sugerencia del presidente, esta no es una nueva sección del muro.
Es un trabajo de restauración y parte del Proyecto de Reemplazo del Muro Fronterizo del Proyecto Santa Teresa de $73.3 millones de dólares.
El trabajo está siendo emprendido por el Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército de Estados Unidos (USACE). Trump lo aprobó él mismo, cuando asumió el cargo por primera vez en enero de 2017.
“El segmento de la cerca fue construido y financiado por las autoridades de DHS / CBP con el Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército de Estados Unidos que proporciona la contratación / supervisión de la construcción a través de nuestra misión de apoyo interinstitucional”, d ijo a Task & Purpose la vocera del Cuartel General de USACE, Raini Brunson. “El video, que se filmó en septiembre de 2018, tiene el logotipo de USACE porque fue producido por USACE”.
El Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército no pudo confirmar de inmediato dónde se originó la solicitud de las imágenes y cómo acabó en la cuenta de Twitter del presidente.
El New York Times informó el mes pasado que no se habían construido nuevas millas de barreras fronterizas bajo la administración de Trump.
Algo que Trump hizo bien, es que el reemplazo en las 20 millas de barreras que se muestran en el clip sí se terminó a fines de enero.
No es la primera vez que el presidente ha intentado este truco, para pasar el trabajo de reparación como el progreso en su promesa de campaña. Usó fotos de partes reconstruidas del muro existente de la misma manera en marzo de 2018, según
Entonces, como ahora, el presidente fue llamado por los verificadores de los hechos y la oposición, mientras que muchos de sus partidarios continuaron retuiteando sus falsas noticias sin críticas.

Texto completo: WAUSAU - Pianist Don Shirley, the subject of the Academy Award-nominated movie "Green Book", confronted racist Jim Crow laws when he performed in the South in the 1960s.
But when Shirley came to Wausau to perform in The Grand theater, he had to deal with another problem altogether: A guy dressed as a gorilla stepped on his birthday cake.
That's the way Barbara Lattimer of Wausau, a voice instructor at the Wausau Conservatory of Music, remembers it.
Barbara's husband of 50 years, businessman and music lover Tom Lattimer, arranged to have Shirley perform in central Wisconsin. She doesn't remember the exact year — she thinks it likely was in the early 1970s, after the era the movie portrays. But portions of that evening stuck with her for nearly 50 years, and the memories came flooding back when she went to see "Green Book."
Barbara enjoyed the movie, especially because it revived the time she met Shirley. It also brought back sweeping memories of Tom, who died in 2012 at age 75. It almost felt, Lattimer said, as if Tom were with her in the theater, or that he might show up as a character in the film.
"Seeing the film was so bittersweet for me," she said.
Tom Lattimer had a long career in business, but his passion was music. He especially loved classical and jazz piano.
A 1954 graduate of Wausau High School, Tom Lattimer was a freshman at the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia when he began to follow the career of Don Shirley. Shirley was a stand-out musician, not only because of his world-class skills as pianist, but also because of the color of his skin.
Born in Pensacola, Florida, Shirley was the son of Jamaican immigrants and was a musical prodigy, playing standard concert classical pieces at age 10 and performing with the Boston Pops at age 18, according to his 2013 obituary in The New York Times.
Shirley, who is played by Oscar winner Mahershala Ali in "Green Book," initially yearned for a career as a classical pianist. But when he was in his 20s, he was counseled that American audiences were not ready for a black classical pianist. So instead he made his name performing pop music and jazz.
Shirley started playing gigs at nightclubs and, according to the Times, "invented what amounted to his own musical genre," a blending of pop, jazz, R&B and classical styles. Tom Lattimer likely first saw Shirley perform in Philadelphia, and the pianist's style enthralled him, Barbara said: "He began to follow the career of Don Shirley and heard him play frequently in East Coast clubs."
Following the career of Shirley also meant getting to know him as a person. Tom was the type of person who could easily insert himself into conversation and widely varying situations. He just had the ability to connect with people. So he would talk with Shirley after performances, likely peppering him with questions, and gradually become a casual acquaintance of the pianist, someone Shirley would recognize and chat with.
Tom Lattimer returned home to Wausau to become a successful agent for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. and a community leader who is remembered for his support of the performing arts.
And he continued to follow Shirley's career. He collected all of his albums and whenever possible, went to see live performances. By this time he and Barbara had married, and she would sometimes go with him.
Tom also had an interest in bolstering the art scene in Wausau. He helped develop the Wausau Conservatory of Music, was a chairman for the Festival of Arts and was a leader in the effort to renovate The Grand theater and create downtown Wausau's ArtsBlock.
A costume party at The Wausau Club was truly smashing. It was natural for Tom to help arrange for Shirley to perform in Wausau.
And it was entirely in character for Tom to invite Shirley to a private party held at The Wausau Club later that evening.
Barbara remembers that it was a costume party, and Tom, after Shirley performed, went to change into a gorilla suit. "I remember Tom meeting Don, holding the head of the suit in his hand," Barbara said. "And Don was upset that he wasn't told it was a costume party. I don't know what he would have done for a costume."
Then Tom and Barbara were taken to the club via Shirley's limousine, and when he got in, Tom put his foot in a birthday cake Shirley had in the car.
But all was forgiven when Shirley got to the party. The pianist was the center of attention, with people buying him drinks and talking with him. He asked Barbara, at one point, how he ever got connected with Tom, and all Barbara could do was explain that was just how Tom was. She couldn't bring herself to tell the musician that her husband had been essentially stalking him for years.
The movie portrays Shirley as a serious, regal and sometimes difficult man who insisted on pushing racial boundaries, Barbara said. The Shirley she remembers was jovial, smiling and laid back.
But, she said, at one point in the evening Shirley did share with Tom that he had a higher purpose to his performing tours.
"He told Tom that 'what I do is not about the music. It's about civil rights,' " Barbara said. "And the movie shows that. He puts himself in danger, trying to cross these (racial) barriers."

NBA lets players mix in politics

Texto completo: The Suns have made several political statements against racism and police brutality over the past five years, more than just wearing customized footwear for Black History Month.
In December, former NBA player, activist and author Etan Thomas came to Talking Stick Resort Arena with Emerald Garner to speak at a Suns players-only meeting.
The nine-year NBA veteran also handed out copies of his third published book, "We Matter: Athletes and Activism."
Thomas' book focuses on the intersection of race and politics in sports.
It features interviews with several Basketball Hall of Famers including Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson, countless NBA all-stars and the Suns' Jamal Crawford.
Beyond basketball, the book also addresses the NFL's collusion case of embattled players Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid, as well as discussions with family members of police brutality casualties including Eric Garner, Philando Castile and Terence Crutcher.
"I would encourage everybody to read it," Crawford said. "It's so informative. It's something that's timeless to be honest with you."
Emerald Garner is the daughter of Eric Garner, who was killed by a New York City police officer in July 2014 while he was arrested for illegally selling cigarettes in his convenience store. Several witnesses of the incident reported that Garner repeatedly yelled "I can't breathe" as he was choked to death.
"Phoenix is one of the teams when after Eric Garner was killed they wore the 'I Can't Breathe' shirts," Thomas said.
"That statement just kind of rang through America, of seeing an entire team speak out after something like that happened, for how powerful it was."
Many NBA teams including the Suns donned "I Can't Breathe" shirts to honor the life of Garner and raise awareness about police brutality in several pre-game warmups during the 2014-15 season.
None of the teams were reprimanded or fined by the NBA. It was a sign of the NBA's pivot from Commissioner David Stern to his successor, Adam Silver in 2014, in allowing players to voice their political views.
"It's a special time athletes are speaking out on different causes and they're using their voices and they're not afraid to," Thomas said. "The NBA is not a league that is trying to silence their voice."
That wasn't always the case. Long before Kaepernick and Reid, two of the NBA's all-time best shooters, Craig Hodges and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, were frozen out by the NBA for their activism in the 1990s.
"I played in the Stern era," Thomas said. "Adam Silver is not against it, not moving backwards. It's completely different.
"Remember that Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Craig Hodges happened during the Stern era."
During the 1995-96 season, Abdul-Rauf, then with the Denver Nuggets, refused to stand during the pre-game playing of the "Star-Spangled Banner." He claimed the American flag as a symbol of oppression and tyranny, and standing for it would deviate from his Muslim faith.
On March 12, 1996, the NBA suspended him for one game, citing a rule that players are required to line up in a "dignified posture" for the anthem.
Two days after his suspension, Abdul-Rauf compromised with the NBA that he would stand during the anthem, but would close his eyes, look downward, and recite an Islamic prayer for people of all races and ethnic backgrounds suffering across the world.
That same year, Hodges filed a $40 million dollar lawsuit against the league to claim that he was being blackballed by the NBA.
According the New York Times, Hodges' lawsuit stated that his association with outspoken Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and criticism of "African-American professional athletes who failed to use their considerable wealth and influence to assist the poor and disenfranchised" made him a pariah by the league.
The lawsuit came four years after Hodges went to the White House with the 1991-92 NBA champion Chicago Bulls and gave a hand-written letter addressed to then-President George H. W. Bush.
The letter explained his discontent for the Bush administration's neglect of the poor and minorities.
As the league's three-time defending 3-point shooting champion, Hodges was waived the Bulls before the 1992-93 season, and was never offered another NBA team tryout.
"I interviewed Adam Silver and asked him if he would punish anybody speaking out," Thomas said. "He said no and that he values athletes using their voices and values athletes using their platforms, and talked about the history of athletes using their platforms like Bill Russell, Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar), Oscar Robertson."
"There was people going through stuff 100 times worse back in the day even though we're still fighting our own fight now," Crawford said about African-American athletes who were activists decades years ago.
"Without those guys to draw from to give courage and inspiration that you can make a difference, especially to come together ... and looking at things from a different perspective and trying to get everybody to view from that viewpoint."
Crawford is all-too familiar with racism in the NBA and using his platform to make statements against it.
In April 2014, an audio clip of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling revealed his disdain for his then-girlfriend's association with African-Americans, including Magic Johnson. Sterling warned her not invite them to the Clippers' home games.
The reported private conversation caused a media firestorm, and then-President Barack Obama, Magic Johnson and Clippers head coach Doc Rivers decried Sterling's incendiary commentary.
"The way we saw it, we weren't playing for Donald Sterling. It was about us, the brotherhood," Crawford said in the book. "Doc was very open and very supportive. He just kept emphasizing that whatever we do, we are going to do this as a unit... He told us that he was just as affected by this just as we were affected by this."
The Clippers team, who Crawford was a member of at the time, threatened a boycott of Game 4 in their first round playoff matchup against the Golden State Warriors on April 27, 2014.
Crawford said the team's boycott threat received much vitriol from NBA fans.
"'You guys didn't stand for anything, you should have done it like this; the athletes of the sixties would've done this or that; this is your moment,'" Crawford said of the backlash to their proposed boycott.
"Sometimes you will be criticized either way."
The Warriors were willing to take a stand with the Clippers in the proposed boycott, but ultimately decided to play the game.
Silver spearheaded the push to force former Clippers owner Donald Sterling to sell the franchise thereafter.
Thomas said that this generation of NBA players have the power of social media that transcends sports to heavily influence their audiences.
"It's like imagine if Muhammad Ali had a Twitter account. That's where LeBron James is right now. He can say whatever he wants to and millions of people will hear it."

Texto completo: Four books by the widely celebrated artist and writer Tomi Ungerer, who died this month, will be rereleased this fall, in a revival of his oeuvre for adults.
Fantagraphics Books, a Seattle-based publishing house that specializes in comics and graphic novels, will republish Ungerer's "The Underground Sketchbook," "The Party," "Babylon" and "Adam and Eve," beginning in the fall.
Ungerer was perhaps best known, especially in the United States, for his children's books. He created the "Mellops" series, about a family of pigs and their misadventures, which included spelunking, striking oil and diving for treasure. He also wrote and illustrated the classic children's book, "Crictor," about a boa constrictor who manages to become a local hero.
[Read his New York Times obituary here.]
But Ungerer also worked in decidedly adult realms: he made antiwar posters during the Vietnam War, and in 1969 published "Fornicon," a series of comical but erotic drawings that shocked the public and generated controversy when it was released. Some of his books were subsequently banned or removed from libraries. In 2015, some of this work was displayed at the Drawing Center in a survey, but much of it is out of print in the United States.
Gary Groth, the publisher of Fantagraphics Books, interviewed Ungerer last year for an issue of "Comics Journal" and was surprised by how difficult it was to find Ungerer's books. "Most of his books weren't available in the States anymore, which was a terrible shame," Groth said in an interview on Tuesday. "I wanted to reintroduce the American public to his work, especially his satirical works."
The four books will be released over the course of about 18 months, beginning with "The Underground Sketchbook" in October. That book, first published in 1964, is an exploration of Mr. Ungerer's subconscious and worldview. When it was first published, The New York Times described it as "modishly macabre." Groth said that its dark humor and visual puns "really did influence a generation of comics."
Groth said that he is in awe not only of Ungerer's drawing skill, but to his "conceptual skill, which was clever and ingenious and wildly outrageous." Groth described his worldview as "nihilistic with a leavening degree of humor and pathos."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: If you Google the definition of a library (or consult an actual dictionary), you'll find a definition similar to "a building or room containing collections of books, periodicals, and sometimes films and recorded music for people to read, borrow, or refer to." While this is more or less true, you'll find that today's libraries are much more than just collections of materials. They are also places where communities gather, people learn and create, and children of all ages explore the world around them. If you don't believe me, visit a library branch near you and check out all of the awesome programs happening, meeting rooms available for public use, and of course, the amazing library collections.
How people access libraries has also changed. While the definition I quoted above mentions a "building or room," you don't necessarily have to visit a building or a room to visit the library. While Shreve Memorial Library does have 21 branch locations (or buildings) housing our collections, you can also access the library on the go through your smartphones, tablets or computers using our e-Branch or have the library come to you through the Mobile Library (also known as the bookmobile).
Using the e-Branch, you can download e-books, audiobooks, movies and music through services such as Hoopla, Overdrive, and Libby. You can also complete research projects by accessing the Louisiana State Library Database page which houses numerous reference collections and services such as HomeworkLouisiana, ReferenceUSA, and World Book Online Encyclopedia. All you need is your Shreve Memorial Library card number to access these great resources on the go.
Not able to make it to a library branch? We understand that everyone may not be able to physically travel to one of our library branches. That is why the Mobile Library is such a great service. The Mobile Library serves area nursing homes, assisted living facilities, day cares, and homes of individuals in Caddo Parish who are not able to visit a library. Services and materials included on the Mobile Library include books, audiobooks and DVDs. You are also able to request materials, and the mobile library can provide storytimes and programs upon request. Organizations, facilities, individuals and neighborhoods can request a stop from the Mobile Library by calling (318) 213-4987.

What's New at the Library
The Name of the Game by Nora Roberts (fiction)
TV producer Johanna Patterson has worked long and hard to make a name for herself in a man's world. She's tough, self-sufficient and isn't about to be impressed by a man like Sam Weaver, whose tough good looks have propelled him to movie stardom. Johanna can't be won over by a pretty face. Sam has a reputation, and Johanna is determined to protect herself at all costs. The problem is that Sam is not quite the man Johanna thought he was. He's better. And for a woman who forgot what it means to be surprised, Sam has an uncanny way of making her lose her self-control...
Liar, Liar by James Patterson (fiction)
Instant New York Times Bestseller. Detective Harriet Blue is a very good cop ... gone very bad. In the space of a week, she has committed theft and fraud, resisted arrest, assaulted a police officer, and is considered a dangerous fugitive from the law. It's all because of one man, Regan Banks. He viciously killed the only person in the world who matters to Harriet – and he plans to kill her next. As she recklessly speeds toward the dark side – and finally crosses it – Harriet won't stop until Regan pays for the many lives he has taken.
The Source of Self-Regard: Selected Essays, Speeches, and Meditations by Toni Morrison (non-fiction)
Arguably the most celebrated and revered writer of our time now gives us a new non-fiction collection – a rich gathering of essays, speeches, and meditations on society, culture, and art, spanning four decades. The Source of Self-Regard is brimming with all the elegance of mind and style, the literary prowess and moral compass that are Toni Morrison's inimitable hallmark. It is divided into three parts: the first is introduced by a powerful prayer for the dead of 9/11; the second by a searching meditation on Martin Luther King, Jr., and the last by a heart-wrenching eulogy for James Baldwin. In the writings and speeches included here, Morrison takes on social issues: the foreigner, female empowerment, the press, money, "black matter(s)," and human rights.
Samanth Bonnette is Marketing & Development Manager at Shreve Memorial Library.

Texto completo: In light of the sexual harassment news just from the past week, you’d be excused for wondering if taking down Harvey Weinstein and his counterparts had done any good at all. Now, hundreds of Southern Baptist leaders have been accused of sexual abuse, and Mandy Moore’s ex-husband Ryan Adams has been revealed to be a narcissistic, libidinous creep.

But the trajectory of exposes on sexual harassment and assault reveals an important side of abuse that’s not often discussed. If the biggest charge against the #MeToo movement is that it has crippled itself by conflating serious crimes with unfounded allegations, its next great flaw is overemphasizing abusers and neglecting the friends, colleagues, and admirers that make their guilt possible.

Last week, an investigation by the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News revealed that Southern Baptist leaders and volunteers have sexually abused more 700 victims over the past 20 years. Nearly 400 leaders face sexual abuse allegations but only some 250 have been charged.

Some allegations of misconduct were neither reported to law enforcement nor shared with other congregations. Multiple registered sex offenders continued to lead.

Just a few days after the Southern Baptist story broke, the New York Times published an expose on rock singer Ryan Adams. The prolific singer-songwriter has a history of emotional abuse and sexual harassment toward women, one of his victims was just 14 years old. He even admitted his communications with her were inappropriate, texting: “If people knew they would say I was like R Kelley lol.”

The 44-year-old sent explicit text messages to the underage musician, Ava, and pressured other female artists to turn their professional relationship physical. When he felt a relationship slipping, he turned to emotional abuse.

The singer-songwriter has released 16 albums, has a tour planned for this spring, though many are calling for a boycott, and the FBI has opened an investigation into his behavior.

How do hundreds of leaders in a religious body get away with sexual abuse, and how, simultaneously, does a narcissistic degenerate continue to find new women to harass? The halo effect.

Abusers in the Southern Baptist church and men such as Adams get away with their actions because they seem so good that they can do no wrong, and the people in their networks say nothing, becoming complicit in their corruption.

Church leaders are meant to be pious, musicians to be artistically pure. If Adams is an artist, a visionary, a poet, he cannot also be a manipulator, a liar, an abuser.

Phoebe Bridgers, one of Adams’ ex-girlfriends, said her friends, family, and fellow musicians helped her out of the relationship. His helped him hide it.

“Ryan had a network too,” she wrote. “Friends, bands, people he worked with. None of them held him accountable. They told him, by what they said or by what they didn’t, that what he was doing was okay. They validated him. He couldn’t have done this without him.”

If we wonder why sexual abuse scandals continue to break, even while the issue is getting more publicity, we must remember that whole communities are complacent, and therefore complicit. We cannot eliminate sexual abuse without addressing the accomplices who watch and do nothing.

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said an Alabama woman who joined the Islamic State will not be allowed to return to the U.S. because she is not a citizen.

“Ms. Hoda Muthana is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States. She does not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States,” Pompeo said in a statement Wednesday.

Muthana told the New York Times in a story published Tuesday that she wanted to return home to the U.S. after surrendering to American troops last month.

According to the New York Times, Muthana had an American passport when she left the U.S. Pompeo’s statement did not make clear whether her citizenship had been revoked or if she was ever a U.S. citizen.

More than four years ago, she bought a plane ticket to Turkey with her college tuition money and was smuggled into Syria. The 24-year-old has been married to three ISIS fighters, two who died and a third she divorced.

After joining ISIS, she witnessed executions and urged others to join the group in social media posts that were critical of the U.S.

She told the Times she began having doubts about her decision to join the terrorist group during her second year in Syria, when she was married to her second husband and pregnant with her son.

“I ruined my life. I ruined my future,” she said.

“I realized how I didn’t appreciate or maybe even really understand how important the freedoms that we have in America are. I do now,” she wrote to a lawyer trying to help her return to the United States. “To say that I regret my past words, any pain that I caused my family and any concerns I would cause my country would be hard for me to really express properly.”

Pompeo’s statement also did not address a second woman in the New York Times story who holds dual citizenship in Canada and the U.S. and is seeking to return home after joining ISIS. Kimberly Gwen Polman lived in Canada before joining ISIS.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been pressuring Europe to take back foreign ISIS fighters captured in Syria as the U.S. prepares to withdraw its troops from the country. Europe has so far been reluctant to take back their citizens over potential legal challenges.

The U.K. refused to allow a London teenager back into the country after she said last week she wants to “come home” after joining ISIS four years ago.

Shamima Begum, 19, told the Times of London she did not regret running away to Syria, but fears for her newborn’s life. Begum gave birth over the weekend and has had two other children die in Syria.

The U.K. said it plans on revoking her British citizenship to prevent her from returning.

Chanel's global icon Lagerfeld dies in Paris

Texto completo: PARIS - Karl Lagerfeld, the iconic couturier whose designs at Chanel and Fendi had an unprecedented impact on the entire fashion industry, died Tuesday in Paris, prompting an outpouring of love and admiration for the man whose career spanned six decades.
Although he spent virtually his entire career at luxury labels catering to the very wealthy - including 20 years at Chloe - Lagerfeld's designs quickly trickled down to low-end retailers, giving him global influence.
Former supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who credits Lagerfeld as her mentor, called him her "magic dust.
"What [Andy] Warhol was to art, he was to fashion; he is irreplaceable, she said.
The German-born designer may have spent much of his life in the public eye - his trademark white ponytail, high starched collar and dark glasses are instantly recognizable - but he remained a largely elusive figure.
Such was the enigma surrounding the octogenarian Lagerfeld that even his age was a point of mystery for decades, with reports he had two birth certificates, one dated 1933 and the other 1938.
In 2013, Lagerfeld told the French magazine "Paris Match he was born in September 1935 - which would make him 83 today - but in 2019, his assistant still didn't know the truth - telling The Associated Press he liked "to scramble the tracks on his year of birth - that's part of the character.
Chanel confirmed that Lagerfeld, who had looked increasingly frail in recent seasons, died early Tuesday in Paris. Last month, he did not come out to take a bow at the house's couture show in Paris - a rare absence that the company attributed to him being "tired.
"An extraordinary creative individual, Lagerfeld reinvented the brand's codes created by Gabrielle Chanel: the Chanel jacket and suit, the little black dress, the precious tweeds, the two-tone shoes, the quilted handbags, the pearls and costume jewelry, Chanel said.
The brand's CEO Alain Wertheimer praised Lagerfeld for an "exceptional intuition that was ahead of his time and contributed to Chanel's global success.
"Today, not only have I lost a friend, but we have all lost an extraordinary creative mind to whom I gave carte blanche in the early 1980s to reinvent the brand, he said.
Chanel said Virginie Viard, his longtime head of studio, will create the house's upcoming collections, but did not say whether her appointment was permanent.
Tributes from fellow designers, Hollywood celebrities, models and politicians quickly poured in. Donatella Versace thanked Lagerfeld for the way he inspired her and her late brother, Gianni Versace.
Lagerfeld was one of the most hardworking figures in the fashion world, joining luxury Italian fashion house Fendi in 1965 and later becoming its longtime womens- wear design chief in 1977, as well as leading designs at Paris' family owned powerhouse Chanel since 1983.
While at Fendi, Lagerfeld helped create the notion of fun fur, lending an ease to a formal wardrobe topper by adding stylized touches.
At Chanel, he served up youthful designs that were always of the moment and sent out almost infinite variations on the house's classic skirt suit, ratcheting up the hemlines or smothering it in golden chains, strings of pearls or pricey accessories.
Wit was never far behind any collection.
"Each season, they tell me [the Chanel designs] look younger. One day, we'll all turn up like babies, he once told The Associated Press.
His outspoken and often stinging remarks on topics as diverse as French politics and celebrity waistlines won him the nickname "Kaiser Karl in the fashion media. Among the most acid comments included calling former French President Francois Hollande an "imbecile who would be "disastrous for France in Marie-Claire, and telling The Sun British tabloid that he didn't like the face of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister.
"She should only show her back, he advised.
Lagerfeld was also heavily criticized for sending out a negative message to women when he told France's Metro newspaper that British singer Adele was "a little too fat.
Despite this, he was very kind to his staff at Chanel, generous with his time with journalists and shared his Parisian mansion with a Siamese cat called Choupette.
"She is spoilt, much more than a child could be, he told the AP in 2013.
Lagerfeld had little use for nostalgia and kept his gaze firmly on the future. Well into his 70s, he was quick to embrace new technology: He famously had a collection of hundreds of iPods. A photographer who shot ad campaigns for Chanel and his own eponymous label, Lagerfeld also collected art books and had a massive library and a bookstore as well as his own publishing house.
He was also an impressive linguist, switching between perfect French, English, Italian and his native German during interviews at fashion shows.
Even as he courted the spotlight, he made a deliberate effort to hide what was going on behind his trademark dark shades.
"I am like a caricature of myself, and I like that, British Vogue quoted Lagerfeld as saying. "It is like a mask. And for me, the Carnival of Venice lasts all year long.
After cutting his teeth at Paris-based label Chloe, Lagerfeld helped revive the flagging fortunes of the storied Paris haute couture label Chanel in the '80s. There, he helped launch the careers of supermodels including Schiffer, Ines de la Fressange and Stella Tennant.
In a move that helped make him a household name, Lagerfeld designed a capsule collection for Swedish fast-fashion company H&M in 2004 and released a CD of his favorite music shortly after.
A weight-loss book he published in 2005 - "The Karl Lagerfeld Diet - consolidated his status as a pop culture icon. In the book, Lagerfeld said it was his desire to fit into slim-cut Dior suits that had motivated his dramatic transformation.
The son of an industrialist who made a fortune in condensed milk and his violinist wife, Lagerfeld was born into an affluent family in Hamburg, Germany. He had artistic ambitions early on. In interviews, he variously said he wanted to become a cartoonist, a portraitist, an illustrator or a musician.
"My mother tried to instruct me on the piano. One day, she slammed the piano cover closed on my fingers and said, draw, it makes less noise, he was quoted as saying in the book "The World According to Karl.
At 14, Lagerfeld came to Paris with his parents and went to school in the City of Light. His fashion career got off to a precocious start when, in 1954, a coat he designed won a contest by the International Wool Secretariat. His rival, Yves Saint Laurent, won that year's contest in the dress category.
Lagerfeld apprenticed at Balmain and in 1959 was hired at another Paris-based house, Patou, where he spent four years as artistic director. After a series of jobs with labels including Rome-based Fendi, Lagerfeld took over the reins at Chloe, known for its romantic Parisian style.
Lagerfeld also started his own label, Karl Lagerfeld, which though less commercially successful than his other ventures, was widely seen as a sketchpad where the designer worked through his ideas.
In 1983, he took over at Chanel, which had been dormant since the death of its founder, Coco Chanel, more than a decade earlier.
"When I took on Chanel, it was a sleeping beauty - not even a beautiful one, he said in the 2007 documentary "Lagerfeld Confidential. "She snored.
For his debut collection for the house, Lagerfeld injected a dose of raciness, sending out a translucent navy chiffon number that prompted scandalized headlines.
He never ceased to shake up the storied house, sending out a logo-emblazoned bikini so small the top looked like pasties on a string and another collection that dispensed entirely with bottoms, with the models wearing little jackets over opaque tights instead.
Lagerfeld was open about his homosexuality - he once said he announced it to his parents at 13 - but kept his private life under wraps. Following his relationship with a French aristocrat who died of AIDS in 1989, Lagerfeld insisted he prized his solitude above all.
"I hate when people say I'm solitaire' [or solitary.] Yes, I'm solitaire in the sense of a stone from Cartier, a big solitaire, Lagerfeld told The New York Times. "I have to be alone to do what I do. I like to be alone. I'm happy to be with people, but I'm sorry to say I like to be alone, because there's so much to do, to read, to think.
As much as he loved the spotlight, Lagerfeld was careful to obscure his real self.
"It's not that I lie, it's that I don't owe the truth to anyone, he told French Vogue.

Kaiser Permanente to open medical school in Pasadena, offer free tuition for first classes in 2020

Texto completo: Kaiser Permanente is opening a hospital-run school of medicine in Pasadena, announcing Tuesday, Feb. 19 it would waive tuition for its first five graduating classes in an attempt to jump-start medical careers minus the typical crushing student debt.
The Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine said it has received preliminary accreditation and will begin accepting applications from prospective students in June for admission in the summer of 2020.
This will be a unique learning institution for Kaiser, which plans to waive all tuition for the full four years of school at its campus at 98 S. Los Robles Ave. Those classes — with 48 students each — will run from 2020 through 2024.
Tuition would typically cost $55,000 a year, saving each student $275,000.
“This is primarily about making sure all students, regardless of backgrounds, aren’t deterred from pursuing a career in medicine due to the prospect of going into massive debt,” said Kaiser spokesman Vincent Staupe. “This is also about wanting students to be able to choose a medical specialty that they are truly passionate about, rather than choosing one based solely off financial need.”
Kaiser hopes the strategy will prompt more students to pursue lower-paying specialties in the primary care field, or work in under-served areas since they wouldn’t be burdened with overwhelming debt.
The school will use a “small-group, case-based medical curriculum” that are designed to prepare future physicians to become collaborative leaders committed to prevention, fluent in data-driven care and adept at addressing the needs of under-served patients and communities.
Dr. Mark A. Schuster, the school’s founding dean and CEO, said the health care giant is developing a school committed to providing “outstanding patient care in our nation’s complex and evolving health care system.”
The school said it has recruited a diverse group of leaders with vast health care experience who, in turn, created a curriculum that includes three academic pillars — foundational science, clinical science and health systems science.
The school’s clinical education will take place primarily in Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in the greater Los Angeles area and in partnered community health centers.
Other medical schools at universities have taken steps recently to decrease their students’ financial burden. Columbia University, for example, is using a $250 million gift for a new endowment that will fund a range of scholarships and grants meant to ensure none of its medical students incur debt.
About three-quarters of medical school students graduate with debt, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges; members of the 2017 graduating class who had debt reported a median amount of $192,000.
Kaiser’s medical school has received preliminary accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, a different process than usual because, unlike the universities that open medical schools, it is not already a degree-granting institution.
The New York Times contributed to this report.

Texto completo: The producers of the Academy Awards are conceding that despite hopes otherwise, this Sunday's telecast will run more than three hours. Meanwhile, the Motion Picture Academy separately announced that Bette Midler and Queen will perform and recent Grammy winner Kacey Musgraves will present at the ceremony.
"We were hired to deliver a shortened show," said Donna Gigliotti, co-producer with Massapequa Park native Glenn Weiss, in a New York Times story published Sunday. "How do we do that so you're not seeing award, award, commercial, award, commercial, award? So boring."
Yet after the Academy reversed course on Friday and said four categories consigned to commercial breaks would return to the live show, the organization asked her if the telecast could still be contained with three hours. "The answer was no," Gigliotti said.
She had hoped the Academy's decision to forego a host -- after Kevin Hart resigned following past homophobic tweets and jokes for which he has apologized -- would have presented a way to end the show by 11 p.m., when viewership drops off significantly. She said the show at least would begin presenting awards sooner than usual without the need to allot time to a host's opening monologue or sketch.
Eight people from outside the movie industry are being brought in to lead presentations about certain films, the Times said. Tennis champion Serena Williams will address last year's remake of "A Star Is Born," one of eight films vying for best picture. No other outsiders were named.
Meanwhile, the British band Queen, now fronted by the late Freddie Mercury's stand-in, Adam Lambert, will perform on the show. The biopic of Mercury is a best-picture nominee.
On Saturday, Midler tweeted. "So, (drum roll) Ladies and Gentlemen, I will be chanteusing (that's singing) on the Oscars on Feb 24...the nominated song from 'Mary Poppins ' ... 'The Place Where Lost Things Go' ...so excited!!" The singer-actress has won Tony, Grammy and Emmy Awards and been nominated twice for an Oscar.
The same day, country singer Kacey Musgraves, who won four Grammy Awards this year, including album of the year, tweeted a link to a news story reporting that she will present an award.
"The 91st Academy Awards" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on ABC.

Texto completo: The city's Commission on Human Rights issued legal guidelines Monday on discrimination on the basis of hair.
The commission's report said racism against black people can often include discrimination against "natural hair or hairstyles that are closely associated with their racial, ethnic, or cultural identities."
The report said the city's laws protect people who want to wear their hair any way, including "treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed state."
The new guidelines follow complaints from workers at a city medical facility as well as a nonprofit in the Bronx, an Upper East Side hair salon, and a restaurant in Howard Beach, The New York Times reported.
The city report said that while an employer, can require employees to dress appropriately for work, they cannot enforce any policy in a "discriminatory manner and/or target specific hair textures or hairstyles."
"Therefore, a grooming policy to maintain a 'neat and orderly' appearance that prohibits locs or cornrows is discriminatory against Black people because it presumes that these hairstyles, which are commonly associated with Black people, are inherently messy or disorderly," the report continues.
"This type of policy is also rooted in racially discriminatory stereotypes about Black people, and racial stereotyping is unlawful discrimination under the [New York City Human Rights Law]."
Carmelyn P. Malalis, the commissioner and chairwoman of the New York City Commission on Human Rights,Malalis said in a tweet on Monday that "Hair is a part of you. Race discrimination based on hair is illegal in NYC." The tweet included a photo of former President Barack Obama allowing a small boy to touch his hair in the Oval Office.

Texto completo: On the back cover of his new book, "The Threat: How the F.B.I. Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump," Andrew G. McCabe looks preposterously fit (he competes in triathlons). His hands are at his hips, gunslinger style. It's as if he were a kind High Plains sheriff who had stumbled upon an intolerable rodeo of villainy.
McCabe's prose is lean, too. (Not that he wrote this book. In his acknowledgments, he thanks "a great writing and editing team.") The first sentence demands to be read in the voice of Jack Webb from "Dragnet": "Between the world of chaos and the world of order stands the rule of law."
McCabe is, of course, the former deputy director of the F.B.I. who was fired last March, just 26 hours before his scheduled retirement. He was briefly the F.B.I.'s acting director, after the dismissal of James B. Comey. The president hooted on Twitter: "Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the F.B.I. -- A great day for Democracy."
This lawman, a registered Republican for the entirety of his adult life, may have been driven out of Dodge. But he has dusted off his white hat and returned with a memoir that's better than any book typed this quickly has a right to be.
"The Threat" is a concise yet substantive account of how the F.B.I. works, at a moment when its procedures and impartiality are under attack. It's an unambiguous indictment of Trump's moral behavior. "Let me state the proposition openly," McCabe writes. "The work of the F.B.I. is being undermined by the current president."
It's a rapid-fire G-man memoir, moving from the author's training in Quantico (shades of "The Silence of the Lambs") through his experiences chasing the Russian mob, the Boston Marathon bombers and others. The book is patriotic and oddly stirring. It has moments of opacity, where you feel he is holding back at crucial moments, but it is filled with disturbingly piquant details.
McCabe made headlines after a recent "60 Minutes" interview, during which he reported that top Justice Department officials, disquieted by Trump's firing of Comey, discussed trying to encourage cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. He also confirmed a New York Times report that the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, offered to wear a wire during his meetings with Trump.
These stories, frustratingly, were in the TV interview but are not in this book. But there are many other gleanings.
McCabe's accounts of his baffled interactions with Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, would be high comedy if they were not so dire. They are a highlight, or a lowlight, of this book. We see a Sessions who is openly racist. "Back in the old days," he says to the author about the F.B.I., "you all only hired Irishmen. They were drunks, but they could be trusted."
Sessions seemed not to read his daily briefings. He had "trouble focusing" and "seemed to lack basic knowledge about the jurisdictions of various arms of federal law enforcement."
Sessions concentrated almost solely on the immigration aspect of any issue, McCabe writes, even when there was no immigration aspect. Similarly, "Sessions spent a lot of time yelling at us about the death penalty, despite the fact that the F.B.I. plays no role of any kind in whether to seek the death penalty."
The portrait of Sessions is of a man for whom merely ordering lunch seems to be above the timberline of his intellect and curiosity.
A recent cartoon in The New Yorker depicted a person feverishly covering two walls with a link chart, with names and Scotch tape and Magic Marker, of the Trump administration's alleged misdeeds. Another person stands watching from a doorway. The caption is: "Hon, Mueller's got this. Come to bed."
It turns out that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has strong opinions about charts. McCabe worked under him at the bureau. "He detested diagonal lines," McCabe writes. "Some colors he liked. Some he didn't." McCabe explains the reasons for these preferences.
He writes about Mueller: "Sometimes he would take out the chart and suddenly you would see his face fall, as if to say the kind of thing that he would rarely say: Who made this piece of crap?"
Mueller is, in this book, the Mueller we have come to know: punctual, determined, the antithesis of casual, with a special loathing for people who speak when they don't know what they are talking about.
"Ball-busting is his way of expressing affection," McCabe writes. "If he said, Where does a person even find a tie like that? I knew things were fine: He never went out of his way to insult anyone he didn't actually like."
McCabe's memoir joins a roster of recent and alarming books by high-ranking members of the United States' justice and intelligence communities, each pushing back sharply against the president's war on facts and competence.
These books include Comey's "A Higher Loyalty" as well as "The Assault on Intelligence," by Michael V. Hayden, the former director of the National Security Agency, and "Facts and Fears," by James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, written with Trey Brown.
Each is its own Paul Revere ride of warning. Each is a reminder that we will be reading about Trump and his administration for the rest of our lives, for the exact opposite reason that we will also be reading about Lincoln and his for the rest of our lives.
There's much more in McCabe's book. He's good on things like what it's like to take a polygraph test, and the fastest way to take off a seatbelt.
He wades back through the big muddy of the Benghazi hearings. He writes of his fears about the increasing use of encryption.
He spends a good deal of time talking about Hillary Clinton and her email server. He argues that Comey, whom he admires, made crucial mistakes in how he handled the matter. "As a matter of policy, the F.B.I. does everything possible not to influence elections. In 2016, it seems we did."
He recounts the attacks on his credibility, by Trump and others, after his wife, Jill, ran for Virginia's State Senate as a Democrat in 2015. He hurt his own credibility, according to the F.B.I. inspector general, by making false statements about his contacts with the media.
The Trump-bashing texts between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, his F.B.I. subordinates, did something worse: They cast doubts about the impartiality of the agency. McCabe rushes past this material too swiftly. Yet if McCabe has made mistakes, his basic decency shines through in this memoir.
He adds to our understanding of how deeply Trump remains under Vladimir Putin's sway. After a North Korean ballistic missile test, Trump told an F.B.I. briefer that reports of the test were a hoax. McCabe writes, incredulously: "He said he knew this because Vladimir Putin had told him so."
About Trump, the author asks, "What more could a person do to erode the credibility of the presidency?" He watches this moral limbo dancer go lower and lower. Yet he sees the president as a symptom as much as a disease.
"When is the right time," he asks, "to give up on people's general ability to understand any slightly complicated statement that they don't agree with?"

A chance to fix history, by editing Wikipedia

Texto completo: Nearly everything I know about Martha Mendoza, I learned from her Wikipedia page, which, as of a few weeks ago, did not exist. Mendoza is a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. Her series about forced labor in the seafood industry led to the freeing of 2,000 enslaved Southeast Asian fisherman; because of her articles, Congress passed legislation requiring more transparency from food suppliers.
Her work is important and forceful. The absurd lack of recognition for her contributions on a Wikipedia page could have been for a lot of reasons, but it might have been related to one in particular: Only about 18 percent of Wikipedia's biographical articles are about women. That's up 3 percent from a few years ago, according to the Wikimedia Foundation. But it's still a reflection of the fact that "contributors are majority Western and mostly male, and these gatekeepers apply their own judgment and prejudices," the foundation wrote.
So, grass-roots organizations have set about trying to change the ratio. Groups such as Art + Feminism sponsor regular "hackathons" to train more diverse groups of Wikipedia editors and to publish a broader range of articles.
Mendoza's article was created by Mintaro Oba, a Washington-based speechwriter whose colleagues at West Wing Writers recently decided to launch a side project: making more Wikipedia articles about women. As writers themselves, they opted to focus on authors, journalists and poets. "Most male journalists who have two Pulitzers have Wikipedia pages," Oba notes. So when he learned about Mendoza, he wanted to make sure his submission was approved. He backed up the article with an "epic onslaught of credible sources" to craft an airtight argument for her inclusion.
Coming up on Women's History Month - and in the middle of Black History Month - I've been thinking a lot about the phrase "rewriting history" and how it's almost always presented as a negative or an impossible. You can't rewrite history , proponents of the Confederate flag say to those who want to take it down.
And yet so much of progress requires doing exactly that: rewriting history. Digging out new sources. Making our collective encyclopedia bigger.
Last year, the New York Times launched a project titled "Overlooked," which retroactively writes obituaries for forgotten people - women and people of color whose deaths were not considered historic enough for obituaries when they happened. This month, among others: a children's welfare advocate who helped more than 500 mixed-race orphans find homes after World War II and a clothing designer who outfitted Ella Fitzgerald and Eartha Kitt.
Half of progress is about recognizing women whose accomplishments were, as the Times puts it, "overlooked." But I think the other half of progress is something we consider even less: reframing our understanding of accomplishments. Asking ourselves to determine what events are important and questioning what counts as history at all.
One of Oba's colleagues, Ilana Ross, who spearheaded the company's Wikipedia project, told me the group had tried to submit a Wikipedia article on the New Zealand writer Alison Waley, but it was rejected. She showed me a screenshot of the rejection. Perhaps , it posited, Waley could just be part of her husband's Wikipedia article instead?
It was complicated, Ross said, because Waley's most famous work was, in fact, a memoir about life with her husband. He was a noted translator whom Waley had known for years, though they only married shortly before his death. While Arthur was receiving public accolades for public work, Alison was cataloguing the private, quotidian parts of life: portraits of time, place, parties and people.
But wasn't that also valuable? Ross asked. Weren't those things also important contributions to history - a way of understanding how people lived and what the world looked like?
History can be rewritten . History can be rewritten because it doesn't have to be contained in pages anymore, and the potential for expansion is unlimited. And because doing it better the second time around shows that we've learned from our incomplete job the first time.
I emailed Martha Mendoza a few days ago. She didn't know she had a Wikipedia page until I told her. And while she was pleased with it - it's a good, factual article, she said - her reasons didn't have anything to do with honor or recognition. She simply thought having one would make her job easier. Now, when she approached a source for a story and asked for an interview, she could direct them to her page to prove she was a real journalist and to help them understand the kind of reporting she did.
For that reason, she'd wanted a page for a while. "I thought about asking someone to do it for me," she said. "But it's a little like asking someone to enter you in a contest."
It seemed unseemly and self-aggrandizing to her; she couldn't imagine actually suggesting it. She was glad she hadn't needed to and that someone else had seen her.

Russian fertilizer king’s Palm Beach buy doesn’t look so ‘fantastic’ now

Texto completo: In 2008, Donald Trump sold a Palm Beach mansion to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev for the record price of $95 million.
“I believe the buyer made an absolutely fantastic deal,” Trump told the Palm Beach Post in 2008, “and time will prove this right."
Did time prove Trump right? More than a decade later, the answer looks like nyet .
A Palm Beach Post analysis found Rybolovlev has paid millions to carry the property during the past 11 years, including $12.5 million in property taxes, plus an estimated $1 million per year in upkeep, such as lawn maintenance, utilities and security, for carrying costs believed to
total at least $20 million.
This puts the Russian oligarch’s investment in the Palm Beach property at $115 million, at least, Palm Beach real estate agents said.
A 2016 subdivision led to the tearing down of the 66,000-square-foot mansion and its outbuildings, formerly owned by the late health care magnate Abe Gosman.
Three parcels were carved out of the 6.3-acre property, which has 475 feet of beach. The two outer parcels sold for $37 million and $34 million each, for a total of $71 million.
But the third, middle lot remains for sale at $42 million, a higher price than the other lots fetched.
That $42 million figure still is less than the amount Rybolovlev would need to break even on the deal.
"There is no money that was made here. This was not a great investment,” said Burt Minkoff, a real estate agent with Douglas Elliman on Palm Beach.
Not only are there carrying costs associated with owning the property for so many years, but also the cost of tearing down the buildings and re-platting the property into three parcels is expensive, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, Minkoff said.
Susan Polan, director of luxury sales for Douglas Elliman on Palm Beach, knows the property well.
She said the demolition of the former Gosman mansion would have been costly because the property was unusual in its construction. For one, it had a basement. The upper floor had massive rooms meant mostly for entertaining, including a ballroom. There were some unusual elements, too, including a pizza parlor and a beauty salon, she said.
When the property was subdivided and the three lots put up for sale, the lots didn’t sell for more money because they are too narrow, she said. This is despite the fact that the site “is the best location in all of Palm Beach,” she said, on the north side of the island but near several restaurants and shops.
As for that remaining middle, $42 million parcel, "I don't see that trading for full asking price,” Minkoff said. “Things usually sell within 10 percent of asking price."
Through a spokesman, Rybolovlev would not comment on whether the Palm Beach transaction has turned out to be a fantastic deal, as Trump had described it. In fact, the spokesman said Rybolovlev would not comment on any aspect of the property, including the status of the remaining $42 million plot.
Rybolovev might not feeling like talking about the Palm Beach property, but lawmakers in Washington have not taken their eyes off it.
With the Democratic Party now in control of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Trump-Rybolovlev sale is getting added scrutiny, given it is one of the few financial links to Russia that Trump has acknowledged.
On May 15, 2008, the day the Palm Beach Post revealed the property was under contract for $100 million, Trump bragged about the deal on CNBC's "Squawk Box." This prompted a CNBC commentator to ask whether Trump would make the Russian buyer put up an American flag, alluding to Trump's past tangles with the town of Palm Beach over the size of the flag flown at Mar-a-Lago.
"I think what I'll do is I will demand that he puts up the American flag," Trump replied. "And the Russian flag can fly right under it."
Then in 2016, Trump told reporters assembled at a press conference in Miami: "What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach ... for $40 million, and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million."
Russian interference in the 2016 elections, plus the number of contacts the Trump campaign had with Russian officials, have cast new light on this old purchase.
The House Intelligence Committee already has signaled its interest in further probing this deal, according to a January report in the New York Times. Earlier this month, the committee chairman said House investigators planned to probe Trump’s relationship with Deutsche Bank. The sale to Rybolovlev came at a time when Trump owed millions to Deutsche Bank.
Special counsel Robert Mueller also has been looking at Trump’s sale of the Palm Beach property to Rybolovlev, Bloomberg News has reported.
Both Trump and Rybolovlev say they’ve never met each other.
Dmitri Rybolovlev is ranked 242th on the Forbes list of billionaires, with an estimated fortune of $6.8 billion. He made his money through his former ownership of a large stake in Uralkali, a fertilizer company.
Rybolovlev never lived in the Palm Beach property and, according to his ex-wife’s lawyer, never even had it inspected before he bought it for $95 million cash in July 2008, closing $5 million below Trump’s asking price of $100 million.
At the time, Rybolovlev said through a spokesman that the Palm Beach property was acquired for "investment purposes" and that he did not plan to live in the United States.
Trump, who bought the 6.3-acre property for $41.35 million four years before, made a profit of about $54 million.
After the transaction closed, the mansion became part of a fight between Rybolovlev and his now ex-wife, Elena. She claimed he was trying to hide assets; he claimed the property was an investment for their children.
Their messy Swiss divorce and money battle in landed on the shores of Palm Beach and washed into Palm Beach County Circuit Court, with Rybolvlev acknowledging in court documents he had paid for the property's upkeep. According to the Palm Beach County tax collector's office, taxes for the entire parcel averaged $1 million to $1.4 million from 2008 until 2016, when the mansion was demolished and the property subdivided.
But Rybolovlev continued to pay taxes on the individual lots until two were sold off, tax records show.
The northernmost lot is owned by homebuilder Mark Pulte of Boca Raton-based Mark Timothy Inc. The southernmost lot’s ownership is a mystery, shrouded in a trust.
Sources said there’s talk that the final lot might be developed into a $100 million home by its listing agent, Lawrence Moens of Lawrence A. Moens Associates Inc., and an unnamed investor.
Moens, who represented Trump in the sale of the property to Rybolovlev, did not return a phone call seeking comment.
But unless and until something big happens on that middle, third parcel, the Russian’s investment sits there, still waiting for a possible score.

Texto completo: Are you among the millions missing out on one of health care's best financial fixes?
Health savings accounts (HSAs) let folks save tax-free for medical needs. If you have a high-deductible health insurance plan (more than $1,350 for individuals or $2,700 for families), you're eligible. Harness HSAs to help fast-track your retirement.
They have three great features: Contributions are tax-deferred, and you can invest the money; their growth isn't taxed; and withdrawals used for qualified medical expenses aren't taxed either. A triple tax break! Huge.
Some confuse HSAs with flexible spending accounts (FSAs), which are also tax-free and cover costs including copayments and prescription drugs. But FSAs are more restricted. The most crucial limitation is FSA contributions are typically "use it or lose it": If you don't use them within the plan year (plus a short grace period, perhaps), they expire.
HSAs are simpler and more flexible. And, critically important, they aren't use-it-or-lose-it. That means growth can compound over time.
"Longer-term advantages, after the age of 65, may include the payment of Medicare premiums and other long-term care expenses," says David Musto, president of Ascensus, a financial services firm. "The HSA becomes an important aspect of both solving near-term medical expenses but also for larger expenses well into retirement with those accumulated earnings.
"HSAs are under your control," Musto says. "You decide when and how the dollars are taken from the HSA. In 2017, 87 percent of HSA distributions were completed using the associated debit card versus needing any sort of employer administrative approval."
By determining when to use the money, or not, you allow them to grow tax-free. That's what spikes HSAs' value to you later on in life. Even if you have big 401(k) savings, withdrawals are taxable unless you have a Roth plan. Paying Medicare premiums and other expenses with tax-free HSA money gives you much more flexibility.
Even before retirement, HSAs are super-handy. Unexpected medical needs can happen any time. Many folks aren't ready. One survey found 46 percent of consumers wouldn't be able to pay an unexpected $1,000 medical bill within 30 days. The average bill for an emergency room visit is nearly double that: $1,917. That can quickly derail your budget, especially if you have a high-deductible plan. Tax-free savings won't heal you if you lop off your fingertip with a power saw (which I did 50 years ago), but they will make it easier to endure.
HSAs make retirement easier – and cheaper – too. Health care expenses dominate many retirees' budgets. Having an HSA means a tax-free lifeline to cover nursing home stays, prescription drugs, medical supplies and much more. That's a key reason many employers offer them: to complement retirement plans, including 401(k)s. Even if you have an easy time paying for medical needs today and have a comfortable buffer for unexpected expenses, saving in an HSA for the future is important.
While 81 percent of eligible employees have enrolled in an HSA, about 61 percent of Americans aren't yet eligible. If that includes you, ask your employer to consider offering one during their next benefits review. The added savings power gives you greater confidence during health emergencies while helping you save for later retirement medical needs.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe hinted at an "inappropriate relationship" between President Donald Trump and Russia during a wide-ranging interview on CBS' "60 Minutes" that has already sparked calls for a congressional investigation.
Speaking to "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley, McCabe said the FBI had reasonable cause to open a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's connection with the Russian government, a potential national security threat, following the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017.
He also said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was "not joking" when he offered to wear a wire into the White House to "collect evidence" into Trump's motivation for firing Comey.
"And the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia's malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator, you have to ask yourself, 'Why would a president of the United States do that?'" McCabe said on "60 Minutes. "
"So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder if there is an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?"
Asked by Pelley if Trump is "in league with the Russians," McCabe said, "I'm saying that the FBI had reason to investigate that. Right – to investigate the existence of an investigation doesn't mean someone is guilty. I would say, Scott, if we failed to open an investigation under those circumstances, we wouldn't be doing our jobs. "
Prior to the airing of McCabe's interview, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Sunday he planned to conduct a Senate investigation into what he characterized as "an attempted bureaucratic coup. "
"We're going to find out what happened here and the only way I know to find out is to call the people in under oath and find out, through questioning, who's telling the truth because the underlying accusation is beyond stunning," Graham said on CBS' "Face the Nation. "
Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, added that he would subpoena McCabe and Rosenstein if they did not agree to testify voluntarily.
Via Twitter, Trump responded Thursday to the news of McCabe's interview by calling him a "disgrace to the FBI and to our Country" who was trying to pretend to be a "poor little Angel. " He also repeated many of his past criticisms of McCabe, who he says helped start the "Russia hoax" and was biased in favor of Hillary Clinton.
During the "60 Minutes" interview, McCabe said Rosenstein resisted Trump's insistence of referencing Russia in a memo to justify Comey's firing — "And the president responded, 'I understand that, I am asking you to put Russia in the memo anyway,'" he said — and later raised the idea of wearing a wire to the White House.
"He said, “I never get searched when I go into the White House. I could easily wear a recording device. They wouldn’t know it was there,” McCabe said. "Now, he was not joking. He was absolutely serious. And, in fact, he brought it up in the next meeting we had. "
He added, "I never actually considered taking him up on the offer. "
The Justice Department last September, responding to a New York Times report that first revealed the conversation, issued a statement from another official who was in the room and interpreted Rosenstein's offer as sarcastic.
Asked during Sunday's interview if Rosenstein supported obstruction and counterintelligence investigations against Trump, McCabe answered, "Absolutely. "
McCabe was fired from the Justice Department last March by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for "an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions. " In the "60 Minutes" interview, McCabe described his firing as politically motivated, telling Pelley he was authorized to release information to the media.
"When is someone going to finally investigate the investa(g)tors?" tweeted the president's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr. , on Friday. "If this isn’t an attempted coup I don’t know what is. Regardless of party if you’re not troubled by this, you’re part of the problem. "
In the "60 Minutes" interview, McCabe recalled meeting with Trump after the president had just fired Comey.
"I was speaking to the man who had just run for the presidency," McCabe said. "And won the election for the presidency and who might have done so with the aid of the government of Russia, our most formidable adversary on the world stage. "
"And that was something that troubled me greatly," he added.
When Pelley asked how long after Comey's firing he decided to begin an investigation into possible obstruction of justice by the president, McCabe replied, "I think the next day, I met with the team investigating the Russia cases and I asked the team to go back and conduct an assessment to determine 'Where are we with these efforts and what steps do we need to take going forward?'"
McCabe said he was "very concerned" and wanted to make sure that he had "the Russia case on absolutely solid ground, in an indelible fashion. " He said wanted to make sure that if he was "removed quickly, or reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish without a trace in the night. "
His book, “The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump," hit bookshelves on Tuesday.

Trump Organization shelves Delta hotel projects

Texto completo: The Trump Organization, citing the political climate, has shelved its prospects for two hotels in Mississippi, The New York Times reported Thursday.
The proposed four-star Scion hotel in Cleveland was expected to open by the end of the year. The hotel was originally slated to open in the fall of 2018.
A second line of hotels, called American Idea, were also expected to open later this year in Greenville, Cleveland and Clarksdale.
"Plans for the two hotel chains, Scion and American Idea, are to be shelved indefinitely, most likely for the remainder of the presidency," the New York Times reported.
Mississippi was the only state in the country where a Trump Organization hotel project was expected to come to completion, the Washington Post recently reported.
The hotels are a collaboration between the Trump Organization, now run by Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and Mississippi businessmen Dinesh and Suresh Chawla. The Chawlas, who own 18 hotels in Mississippi, planned to develop the hotels while the Trumps would brand and manage them.
In a statement about parting ways with the Chawlas, the Trump Organization left open the possibility of reviving the Scion and American Idea brands. Donald Jr. and Eric Trump praised the Chawlas and the would-be Scion property, predicting it would still be "an absolutely spectacular project," according to reporting by the Times.
Dinesh Chawla said his company plans to move forward on the hotels without the Trumps. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, and it is unclear whether the Trumps were required to compensate the Chawlas in some way for pulling out. In the joint statement, the Chawlas said, "We understand their position completely," according to the Times.
On his Facebook page, Chawla heaped praise on the Trump Organization and said the collaboration "never had any political discussions," adding "I never understood the media representation of these folks."
Since the Trumps were handed the company in 2016, it has become the target of federal court cases and lost deals in some markets after partners complained about the brand, the Washington Post reported.
Gov. Phil Bryant has shown public support for Trump and in February the state — through the Mississippi Development Authority — awarded a tax break worth up to $6 million for the Scion hotel project. The tax break would cover almost a third of the hotel development costs, according to building permits.
Several residents of Cleveland supported the Scion hotel development, believing it will lead to additional jobs and revenue for the town, but others said they wouldn't be able to afford to stay at the four-star hotel.

The hallmark of a 4 1/2-star meal? Not wanting it to end

Información de publicación: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]. 17 Feb 2019: F.6.

Texto completo: I am not generally a fan of surprises.
More of a planner, I'm someone who likes to know what his June looks like while the calendar still ticks down the last days of January - the sort of person who is rumored to have been so overwhelmed by the unexpected that he almost turned tail and fled from a surprise party in celebration of his 22nd birthday. I'm not proud of this.
So you'll understand why I'm still baffled that the charismatic, soft-spoken house manager at Hugo's talked me into the chef's choice tasting menu ($90), where each of several courses would present a new mystery.
I did try to learn a bit about what was to come, about overlap between the concise, Ã -la-carte menu and the tasting. "Is the lamb tartare with pickled shallot and lavash ($13) there?" I wondered aloud.
She smiled, placed her index finger across her lips and stage-whispered, "No spoilers."
By that point, my curiosity was piqued. And because the differential in price between selecting a dessert and two of the smaller-format dishes (all are appetizer-sized) along with two larger-format ones was small (around $10), I really had no choice.
It turned out to be the best decision I made all weekend.
From the single baby scallop quick-cured in lime juice, fish sauce and chili oil, served as a tiny amuse-bouche; to the gumdrop-like mango pte de fruits sparking with heat from Korean gochugaru chili flakes, the dozen small plates I tasted gave me a newfound respect for surprise.
Two days later, when I called to interview Mike Wiley (who along with Andrew Taylor, is co-executive chef of Hugo's, The Honey Paw and Eventide), he tossed another curveball in my direction. Unbeknownst to me, my meal had been part of only the second service under the leadership of new chef de cuisine, Ben Christie.
To be fair, Christie is no newcomer. Since coming to Portland five years ago, he has worked every station on the cold- and hot-lines at both Eventide and Hugo's, and has, in his words, "been putting my own dishes on the menu for quite a while now." And in a kitchen focused on precision and fine detail across every aspect of the Asian-influenced, New American menu, it would be hard to imagine anything other than a slow-moving debut for the Colorado-trained chef.
While Christie has not taken Hugo's in a wholly new direction, he has recalibrated its compasses and GPS with his perspective on acid-umami balance. In one dish, he pairs golden, pan-seared monkfish tail with sweet-funky Peekytoe crab salad and sunny, delicate matchsticks of kohlrabi macerated in olive oil and lemon juice so long that they take on the texture of capellini. In another, he grills pinwheels of hash-marked squid marinated in brawny nuoc cham, sticky tamarind paste and lime juice (available Ã  la carte for $13).
When he confits Laughing Stock Farm new potatoes ($12), he skips past unadulterated fats and heads right for a Sichuan-style oil infused with star anise, chili, clove and cinnamon, then tosses the tender potatoes in a meaty-yet-shimmeringly bright vinaigrette made with 'nduja and honey. But don't get too comfortable: In the background, pickled banana peppers preserved from this summer's harvest bristle with both heat and tang.
Nowhere does Christie contrast the barbs and prickles of acid with nose-twitching amino acids more than in a dish of brown-butter-poached, faux-tournÃ©d carrots plated with squidgy, mineral "tongues" of uni. When drizzled with an emulsion of bonito, fish sauce and rice vinegar, its accompanying shreds of house-pickled ginger seem to exhale microscopic puffs of secret floral breath that I didn't know they possessed. It's a hypnotic dish.
And if the menu sounds like nuance over substance, just wait. Lamb loin papered in lamb bacon and served with barely charred, local baby cabbage and a miso-and-butter-layered millefeuille of potato and celery root is a substantial, hearty course. So too, the (unfortunately lukewarm) duck breast with barley, braised onion, chromatic droplets of purÃ©ed whole orange and a crunchy crumble of XO-style duck crackling.
There's even a phenomenal pork consommÃ© the kitchen ladles over scallion microgreens and house-made tortellini stuffed with smoky, marble-sized meatballs fashioned from ground charcuterie scraps. Imagine a black-and-white sketch of a bowl of wonton soup painted lustily with bacon-flavored watercolors.
Finding a wine to go with such a wide-ranging tasting menu can be tricky. I found what I thought was a good candidate among the admittedly pricey list, but had questions, so a server called over another front-of-house staffer she referred to as "our wine guy."
My guest and I were already aware of him; he was the server who had a habit of depositing dishes at our table, quickly reciting a litany of ingredients, then turning on his heels as he spoke the last ones over his shoulder. There would be no clarifying questions.
When I asked him for more details about the Owen Roe "Sinister Hand" ($48), listed by name only under "Featured Producers," I wasn't sure if the bottle I was eyeing was white, red or rosÃ©.
"It's a GSM blend. High brix. Little hot for my taste," was his staccato response.
My brain half-expected a pop-up box to appear, asking if I wanted Google Chrome to translate this conversation from jargon to English.
Luckily, I speak enough Insecure Wine Dude to muddle through, so after requesting some time to discuss our choice, I interpreted for my dinner guest as the server walked away: "He's saying it's not just one grape; it's made from Grenache, Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre, and it's both sweet and pretty alcoholic. It might be overpowering."
A few minutes later, we heard him again, this time leaning on his elbows, chatting familiarly with another couple at two of the 20-odd bar seats that open onto the fully exposed kitchen.
"Of course you've heard of Screaming Eagle, right? I mean, who hasn't?" he inquired rhetorically.
"That, right there is why people are afraid to ask questions about wine," my guest said to me, shaking his head. "When he was standing here, I actually felt like I knew less about the wine than I did before."
Fortunately, the front-of-house manager nominated a Sean Thackrey, Pleiades CuvÃ©e XXIII from California ($60) as a better option, describing it as an ever-changing "field blend" hodgepodge of "Sangiovese, Viognier, whatever else is great that season." And it was, matching well with nearly every savory course, save for an exceptionally light, citrus-zest-cured fluke served with Thai basil, plumped basil seeds, and fermented umeboshi paste made with preserved local plums that the kitchen had been stockpiling for more than a year.
Indeed, wine is one of Hugo's strengths, as it was five years ago, when our then-reviewer praised the breadth of the restaurant's options in his five-star review. Equally impressive is the concise list of specialty cocktails, from the Manhattan-esque Grin and Pear It, made with rye, pear juice and aromatized wine ($12) to the warm Tender's Toddy ($12), a dealer's-choice drink that, on my visit, featured a blend of cognac, lemon juice and mellow, bittersweet Amaro Montenegro.
It wasn't designed to pair with dessert, but the Tender's Toddy would hold up nicely to the sweet, frozen treats that executive pastry chef Kim Rodgers prepares. Chief among these, the tart mango sorbet she serves with an Indian-inspired curried peanut financier, miniature popadums and a flamboyant curd made from entire Meyer lemons, pith and all.
Like nearly everything else I tasted that evening, it kept me guessing, probing with my spoon to reach underneath components for another taste of something I didn't anticipate. Such little twists and intelligent pacing are what keep a two- or three-hour meal dynamic, so that when a tray of gooey Meyer lemon caramels and blood-orange-filled chocolates arrive at your table along with your check, you are (no spoilers here) a little disappointed to see the end of the meal come so soon - no matter how you may have previously felt about surprises.

Texto completo: Just as New Yorkers were absorbing Amazon.com Inc.'s decision to abandon a new office hub after tangling over $3 billion in tax breaks, General Electric Co. was beating a retreat in Boston, canceling plans to build an office tower and promising to return $87 million in government incentives. In Wisconsin, Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn was backing away from promises it made in exchange for billions in incentives.
Stoked by Amazon's decision to turn its search for a new office hub into a nationwide reality show, a long-simmering backlash to corporate subsidies is coming to a boil. State legislators in Connecticut, Florida, Illinois and New York are targeting subsidies to individual companies. At the federal level, Sen. Bernie Sanders last year introduced a bill that would tax Amazon, Walmart Inc. and other big employers whose workers collect public assistance.
Good government advocates have long complained that giving tax breaks and other incentives to lure corporations to states and municipalities was a wasteful practice. (Just how wasteful was hard to calculate, but a New York Times investigation in 2012 reported that states, cities, and counties are giving up more than $80 billion a year.)

Despite the costs, the political logic behind such deals was simple. Though companies might move to get closer to talented workers or important customers, incentives allow government officials to claim credit for attracting jobs, said Nate Jensen, a professor at University of Texas-Austin. Lawmakers in locations with little chance of landing a corporate target have a more perverse incentive to make rich offers.
For the most part, deals were done quietly. Amazon's pageant changed that, as did the election of Donald Trump, who turned the recruitment of industrial companies such as Foxconn into key examples of his pro-manufacturing policies.
The attention may have helped corporate locators win richer incentives, but it meant more people were watching to make sure the companies held up their ends of the deal. That hasn't always been the case.
Foxconn, which won a $4.5-billion incentive package from the state of Wisconsin, indicated last month it was reconsidering whether it is economically feasible to develop liquid-crystal displays there. The state economic development agency said the company deserves "flexibility" after it changed the fundamental terms of its contract and missed its first-year hiring target.
In Buffalo, N.Y., where Elon Musk once promised to build the largest solar panel factory in the Western Hemisphere, state dealmakers acceded to a series of amendments lowering the number of factory jobs Tesla needed to create under its $750-million incentive contract, with no penalty to the company.
Mary Donegan, an urban and community studies professor at the University of Connecticut, said the local resistance to Amazon's headquarters search gives other communities a blueprint for fighting big tax break deals, and may persuade states to avoid high-profile mega deals.
Seen another way, Amazon just proves that the economic development game is gaining steam. The company received 238 bids from state and local agencies. Absent a federal ban on similar deals, there's no reason to expect that the whole thing will go away.

KIDS, TEACH YOUR TEACHERS AND OTHERS WELL ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS

Texto completo: Kylan Bjornson of Scenery Hill, Washington County, has a thing or two to say about fracking.
"There are regulations that allow conventional [gas] wells to be close to homes. That's unnecessary," he said. "We have the technology to be able to drill farther away, but we choose not to."
And while he's on the subject of improving the quality of life, how about reducing truck traffic and improving the quality of the air and water?
Kylan, a 14-year-old student at Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School in Beaver County, was among a group of young people who spoke at a unique teacher workshop series designed to get kids thinking about the world beyond their homes, schools and digital devices. The workshops aim to teach teachers how to effectively present those ideas to their students.
The program, Young Voices for the Planet (www.youngvoicesfortheplanet.com), was founded and directed by Lynne Cherry, an author and illustrator of 30 nature-oriented children's books. The program includes a film series and teacher workshops in which kids are encouraged to challenge decision-makers, create solutions and kick-start the changes that Ms. Cherry believes will ultimately solve the world's biggest problems.
"A lot of students watched the Parkland [High School] kids on TV. They're asking about the shooting, asking teachers if there's anything they can do," said Ms. Cherry. "Teachers are asking, 'How can I help young people to be empowered and believe in their ability to change things?' "
Her books include "Flute's Journey: The Life of a Wood Thrush" (1997), "A River Ran Wild: An Environmental History" (2002), and her New York Times best-seller, "The Great Kapok Tree: A Tale of the Amazon Rainforest," released in 2000.
Grants from the Heinz Endowments and the Garden Club of Allegheny County have funded workshops at First Unitarian Church of Pittsburgh and La Roche College. More workshops are scheduled March 9 at Lutherlyn Camp in Butler, March 10 at Phipps Conservatory in Oakland, May 11 at Fern Hollow Nature Center in Sewickley, and June 26 at Pittsburgh Botanic Garden at Settler's Cabin Park.
On April 20, Ms. Cherry is to present her Young Voices for the Planet film series at the Botany Hall auditorium of Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens in Schenley Park, Oakland.
"What makes it compelling for students is looking at issues that are relevant in their lives locally," said Ms. Cherry. "It's empowering young people so they realize they can change minds, laws and the world through civic engagement and democracy."
On March 28, Ms. Cherry will lead about 300 students and teachers to Washington, D.C., where they will hand-deliver climate action resolutions to each of the 535 U.S. House and Senate offices. Kylan is going, as well as his sister Odessa, 9, and brother Gunnar, 12, who also participated in the La Roche workshop. He's excited about the trip.
"We need to instill the spark into people so they are more aware of things around them and things happening in their communities," Kylan said. "The biggest change we can make is within the families of America. No legislation can change things more than families."
For more information, contact outreach director Kimberly Gutzler at 202-479-9141 or youngvoicesforplanet@gmail.com.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe said in a Thursday televised interview that he ordered an investigation into President Donald Trump's ties to Russia, and acknowledged that high-level Justice Department officials discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.
McCabe's revelations - outlined in a piece he published in "The Atlantic" magazine and in a sit-down interview with CBS News' Scott Pelley - sparked condemnation from Trump on Twitter, who called the former career law enforcement officer a "disgrace to the FBI."
McCabe told Pelley that he grew increasingly concerned that Trump would put an end to the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election after the president abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017.
A day after Comey's ouster, McCabe directed top department officials to examine Trump's ties to Russia, telling Pelley he believed Trump "might have won the White House with the aid of the government of Russia."
"I wanted to make sure that our case was on solid ground and if somebody came in behind me and closed it and tried to walk away from it, they would not be able to do that without creating a record of why they made that decision," McCabe said in an interview on CBS' "60 Minutes" that will fully air on Sunday.
Pelley, previewing the interview on CBS "This Morning," said McCabe confirmed a September 2018 New York Times report that stated Justice Department officials had discussed the possibility of recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office on the ground that he was allegedly acting against America's interests with regard to Russia.
"There were meetings at the Justice Department in which it was discussed whether the vice president and a majority of the cabinet could be brought together to remove the president of the United States under the 25th Amendment," Pelley said. "These were the eight days from Comey's firing to the point that Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel. And the highest levels of American law enforcement were trying to figure out what to do with the president."
Pelley also said McCabe confirmed a Times report that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein suggested wearing a wire in meeting with the president.
The Justice Department pushed back on both of McCabe's claims in a statement, saying "based on [McCabe's] personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment."
"As to the specific portions of this interview provided to the Department of Justice by 60 Minutes in advance, the Deputy Attorney General again rejects Mr. McCabe's recitation of events as inaccurate and factually incorrect," the department said in a statement. "The Deputy Attorney General never authorized any recording that Mr. McCabe references."
McCabe, whom the president has long targeted on Twitter, was fired by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions last March, a day before his retirement. Sessions cited McCabe's "lack of candor" for the removal, pointing to a Justice Department Inspector General report that concluded McCabe misled investigators about his disclosure of information to reporters. McCabe has denied the investigation's findings.
Trump took aim at McCabe in a series of Thursday tweets, saying "Disgraced FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe pretends to be a 'poor little Angel,'" while accusing him of being "a puppet for Leakin' James Comey."
"McCabe is a disgrace to the FBI and a disgrace to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!," Trump wrote.
McCabe's statements come as he prepares to release a book this month titled "The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump."

Texto completo: In Detroit, it's as much a part of Valentine's Day as roses, chocolates and mushy greeting cards. The slightly naughty and always entertaining DIRTY SHOW is back for a second weekend starting Thursday at the Russell Industrial Complex. The annual display of erotic art, now in its 20th year, draws artist-provocateurs from around the world as well as metro Detroit. This year's special guest artist is native Detroiter Glenn L. Barr, whose paintings typically depict surreal creatures and tragic characters in seedy, urban settings. In addition to art, Dirty Show guests get to partake of burlesque and go-go dancers, erotic art films, bars and food vendors. However, it's the people watching that keeps many of them returning to the event year after year. Let the freak flags fly!
7 p.m.-2 a.m. Thursday-Saturday (ages 18 and older Thursday, 21 and older Friday-Saturday), Russell Exhibition Center at the Russell Industrial Complex, Detroit. 800-838-3006. dirtyshow.org. $40, $100 VIP.
Ice skating, hockey games and s'mores melting on an open fire. There are no better ways to spend a chilly February afternoon, and they'll all be awaiting revelers Saturday at the WINTER CARNIVAL AND HOCKEY CLASSIC in Clark Park. The annual southwest Detroit event will also include a petting zoo, horse-drawn carriage rides and a traveling exhibit from the Detroit Institute of Arts. The day concludes with fund-raising hockey games, including the traditional men's game and, for the first time, a women's game. Players make donations to be part of the games, and proceeds go to Clark Park and its youth programs. All the day's activities are free.
The carnival runs noon-4 p.m., and the hockey games start at 6 p.m. Clark Park, southwest Detroit. clarkparkdetroit.com. Free.
Break a leg? No problem. Props fall off walls, lines are forgotten, cues are missed and an actress is knocked unconscious in 2017 Broadway hit "THE PLAY THAT GOES WRONG," which has just landed at the Fisher for a run that continues through Feb. 24. The madcap British comedy centers on a theater company — the Cornley University Drama Society — that's attempting to stage a 1920s murder mystery with a group of accident-prone thespians who are magnets for misery. The Broadway version of the play closed just last month after 745 regular performances and 27 previews, and the North American tour launched last September. U.S. reviews of the show, which has been tickling funny bones in Britain since 2012, have been fair to good, with the New York Times' Ben Brantley opining: "My reactions ranged between thinking this play was exhaustingly funny to finding it just plain exhausting."
8 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday, 7 p.m. Sunday, 2 p.m. matinees on Saturday-Sunday through Feb. 24, Fisher Theatre, Detroit. 800-982-2787. broadwayindetroit.com. $44 and up.
Actor, comic and occasional rapper MIKE EPPS takes the stage at the Fox on Friday for an evening of laughs with fellow comics Don (DC) Curry and Karlous Miller. The Indianapolis-born, New York-raised Epps is best known for his movie work in "Next Friday," "Friday After Next" and the "Hangover" franchise. A few years back, he was tapped for the starring role in a much-buzzed-about Richard Pryor biopic, which eventually stalled out. Fans can next see him in Amazon comedy "Troop Zero," which premiered earlier this month at the Sundance Film Festival; Netflix biographical comedy "Dolemite Is My Name," which is based on the life of raunchy comic Rudy Ray Moore (played by Eddie Murphy); and "The Trap," produced by Epps and co-starring T.I. and Queen Latifah.
7 & 10:30 p.m. Friday, Fox Theatre, Detroit. 800-745-3000. 313presents.com. $57 and up.
A big and bold American classic will unfold starting Friday on the tiny stage at Ferndale's Ringwald Theatre. The ambitious Ringwald company, which has previously produced "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "Glengarry Glen Ross," is tackling Arthur Miller's "DEATH OF A SALESMAN" for the next four weekends. The Pulitzer-winning 1949 tragedy follows insecure and self-deluded salesman Willy Loman, who struggles near the end of his life to understand how success and happiness have eluded him and frets that his two sons seem destined to lead lives no more fulfilling than his. Lee J. Cobb originated the iconic role of Willy Loman on Broadway, and it has been assumed in the decades since by everyone from George C. Scott and Dustin Hoffman to Brian Dennehy and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Metro Detroit theater vet Joel Mitchell stars in the Ringwald staging.
8 p.m. Friday-Saturday & Monday (continues through March 11), Ringwald Theatre, Ferndale. 248-545-5545. theringwald.com. $20, $10 Mondays.
Now that the North American International Auto Show has taken its final bow at Cobo Center, the downtown venue is gearing up for another rite of winter: the DETROIT BOAT SHOW. Exhibitors will be showing off 2019 watercraft designed for everything from fishing to cruising to skiing plus marine supplies and accessories at the 61st edition of the popular Michigan event. Other highlights include shows featuring live sharks in a tank, a simulator that allows guests of all ages to test their boating skills, fishing seminars, a free boater safety course, a tiki bar and the return of Twiggy the Water-Skiing Squirrel.

A stage musical based on a mostly forgotten movie from the 1990s is the midwinter offering from Meadow Brook Theatre. "THE SPITFIRE GRILL," inspired by the 1996 film starring Ellen Burstyn, arrived off Broadway just days before the events of Sept. 11, 2001, and warmed the hearts of New York critics and audiences alike during that unsettling autumn. The story line follows a young woman just out of prison who decides to begin life anew in a small Wisconsin town via employment at a ramshackle diner called the Spitfire Grill. Over the course of two acts and 20 or so musical numbers, she leads the town on a path toward a tenuous awakening. "The music is very moving," says Meadow Brook's Travis W. Walter, who directs with the help musical director Jeffrey Campos. Heads up to those who remember the movie: The musical's ending is entirely different.
Wednesdays-Sundays through March 10, Meadow Brook Theatre on the campus of Oakland University, Auburn Hills. 248-377-3300. mbtheatre.com. $30-$45.
Three artists who experiment with perspective, form and color to create a sometimes off-balance version of the world around us are the stars of "FRACTURED BEAUTY," opening Saturday at the David Klein Gallery in Detroit. Michigan State University professor Alisa Henriquez uses images gathered from contemporary media to create collage-like works that explore ideas of self, femininity and beauty. Detroiter Andrew Krieger employs carved wood panels and cast clay as a base for his realist paintings, which he refers to as time machines that trigger sense memories of moments from our pasts. L.A.-based sculptor Brad Howe is known for large chameleon-like pieces that change in looks when viewed from various perspectives. The three-artist exhibit continues through March 23. An opening reception takes place 6-8 p.m. Saturday.
David Klein Gallery, downtown Detroit. 313-818-3416. dkgallery.com. Regular hours: noon-6 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.

Texto completo: A senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High shared a heartbreaking photo Thursday taken just before a gunman opened fire killing 17 people at her high school in Parkland, Florida, last year.
Natasha Martinez shared a photo on Twitter taken on Valentine’s Day 2018 "about an hour before all our lives changed for the worst. "
Martinez, recalled the moment when the photograph was taken by Rain Valladares, the school's yearbook editor, in an interview with the New York Times last year.
“I remembered how I felt that morning,” Martinez, a yearbook photographer, told the Times. “I was on my way to fourth period, Spanish, and I was like, ‘Rain!’ It made me really emotional. ”
Valladares shared the image last year along with a photo of Emma Gonzalez, another survivor who has become a vocal gun-control advocate in the wake of the shooting.
Thursday marks one year since a gunman walked into the freshman building at the sprawling high school with a bag containing, among other things, a semiautomatic rifle. In six minutes of shooting, more than 100 rounds were fired, 17 students and staff were killed and 17 were wounded.
On Thursday, students returned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School with flowers for the memorial garden in front of the school.

Gadsden Arts Center shows off its 'Roots'

Texto completo: "Roots," a new exhibition of work from the Gadsden Arts Center & Museum Permanent Collection, brings to the public great works of art by artists from the Big Bend Region, many of which are on public view for the first time.
North Florida is home to a great many visual artists, and promoting their work is a founding principle of the Gadsden Arts. The museum's work to preserve their work through the permanent collection protects our region's cultural history for present and future generations.
"Roots" features work by many artists from the region, notably including Dean Mitchell, Beth Appleton, William Thursby, and Joe McFadden.
Mitchell's oil painting, "Laid Back" depicts a local man from Mitchell's home town of Quincy, Florida who worked at Willie Ward's Body Shop. The painting was featured in the "Black Romantic" exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 2002, from which New York Times art critic Michael Kimmelman dubbed Mitchell a "virtual modern-day Vermeer." The painting was then purchased by a private collector in Hilton Head, SC who in 2018 gave the painting to the Gadsden Arts Center & Museum.
Beth Appleton's "Back to the Garden" is a tribute to the special relationship Appleton has with Quincy and its residents, and was shown in the first exhibition in the Gadsden Arts Bell & Bates Building in 2000. A "Back to the Garden" Challenge was sent out to Gadsden Arts members asking them to contribute money to help buy the piece, a successful effort that made this the first piece acquired for the Permanent Collection.
"East Winds" is a meticulous drawing created by William "Bill" Thursby as a wedding gift. It was later donated to the Gadsden Art Center & Museum by the groom's parents. Thursby's art is closely associated with the early days of Gadsden Arts — his artwork was selected for the 1993 Art in Gadsden poster, and he was given a solo exhibition of his work at Gadsden Arts in its original location on Adams Street in 1997.
"Prospero" by Joe McFadden was commissioned by Janet Hinkle for the Tallahassee Shakespeare Festival in 2000, and depicts the main character from The Tempest delivering one of the most memorable speeches in Shakespearean literature. It was painted just before the festival closed its doors. After arriving in Tallahassee in the 1960s, McFadden went on to win more than 100 awards from his paintings and watercolors in juried exhibitions across the United States.
Roots opened Feb. 2, and will remain on view in the Bates Permanent Collection Gallery through the end of this year. Roots will give visitors to the museum a chance to view a diverse sampling of regional artists whose work is included in the Gadsden Arts Center & Museum Permanent Collection.
The Gadsden Arts Center & Museum is located at 13 N. Madison Street, Quincy, just 25 minutes from Tallahassee. Galleries and museum shop are open Tuesday–Saturday 10am to 5pm. The ArtZone is open for drop-in fun Fridays and Saturdays 10am-5pm, admission-free. Exhibition admission is $5-$10 for adult nonmembers, with a variety of special admission programs. Group visits and guided group tours are available by appointment, 850-627-5023. Information www.gadsdenarts.org.

XPO Logistics to close controversial Tennessee facility

Texto completo: GREENWICH — Transportation-and-logistics specialist XPO Logistics confirmed Thursday that it will close a facility in Memphis, Tenn., where some employees have made allegations of pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment — but conflicting accounts have emerged about the reasons for the shutdown.
The warehouse was investigated last October by The New York Times, with two women reporting that they had miscarriages last year while working at the plant, which processes boxes of iPhones and other devices for Verizon . In a letter distributed Wednesday to workers, XPO said it would start layoffs on April 15 because of an “overall business model change” by Verizon. The Teamsters union — which does not represent the facility’s 400 workers, but is an outspoken critic of XPO’s labor practices — described the shutdown as retaliation.
“My co-workers and I stood up and exposed the terrible conditions at the XPO-Verizon facility in Memphis, including sexual harassment, dangerous heat, pregnancy discrimination and worker abuses,” Lakeisha Nelson, a worker at the facility, said in a statement sent Wednesday night by Teamsters. “In return, XPO and Verizon are shutting down our facility and cutting our jobs. I will not be intimidated by these corporate bullies.”
XPO responded Thursday in a statement that the company has a “strict no-retaliation policy in place that applies to the company, as well as individuals. We encourage employees to voice concerns — including anonymously — without any fear of reprisal.”
Most of the workers will be able to get new jobs at 11 other XPO facilities in the Memphis area, the statement added. In addition, the firm plans to hire about 80 for a new plant scheduled to open later this year. It would be across the street from the closing warehouse, which has operated at 4895 Citation Drive, in the city’s southeast section, since 2003.
Through the acquisition of the Citation Drive plant’s previous owner, XPO took over the property in late 2014.
Congressional scrutiny
One of the women interviewed by The Times, 19-year-old Ceeadria Walker, said she gave her supervisor a doctor’s note that recommended fewer hours on her feet to avoid injury or pregnancy complications. Walker was allowed to focus on paperwork on some days, but she told The Times she spent most of last July on a conveyor-belt line lifting 45-pound boxes. Last August, she miscarried.
The Times also reported that a 58-year-old worker at the Citation Drive plant died in October 2017 of cardiac arrest on the warehouse floor after complaining to co-workers about feeling sick.
XPO initially disputed the accuracy of The Times article, but then said in early December that it would investigate the reported violations.
Also in early December, the company announced a new policy for the care and support of pregnant workers that includes paid family leave, pregnancy and postpartum benefits, and flexible working arrangements. Eligible workers would receive their regular base wages while they used their accommodations and would still qualify for pay increases during that time.
XPO has faced increasing Congressional attention since The Times’ report came out, as well as others on purported worker mistreatment that were published last fall by the Los Angeles Times and PBS’ “NewsHour.”
Last November, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., joined eight other senators to launch an investigation of XPO.
Two weeks later, nearly 100 Democratic U.S. representatives — including Connecticut’s Joe Courtney, Rosa DeLauro, Elizabeth Esty and John Larson — signed a letter seeking a similar probe.
On Wednesday, XPO announced a new program for U.S. employees and their families that gives them mobile-app access to a network of more than 1,400 health practitioners across 20 specialties, including fertility, lactation, infant sleep, nutrition and mental health. Employees can also sign up with a “personal care coordinator” to support them during and after pregnancy.
In a statement Wednesday, Blumenthal expressed doubts about the impact of the new program, although he said he wanted to keep working with XPO to ensure workers and their families receive the support they need during and after pregnancies.
“Although I appreciate XPO’s stated intent to improve benefits and workplace policies for women and families, this new program still leaves many questions unanswered,” he said. “How many workers will actually benefit? Will access to this app make a meaningful difference if underlying workplace policies remain?”
XPO is headquartered at 5 American Lane, in the northwest corner of Greenwich. It operates in 32 countries, and employs about 98,000. It ranked No. 186 on last year’s Fortune 500 list.

Socialism is not an answer

Texto completo: President Donald Trump was principled and politically astute to address, in his State of the Union, the horrors taking place now in Venezuela, and then to declare:
"Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."
Venezuela is indeed a poster child for what happens when a nation's economic machinery falls under political control.
Over the last five years, per The Wall Street Journal, Venezuela's economy shrank by 35 percent and poverty almost doubled, from 48 percent to 87 percent.
According to Gallup, 71 percent of Venezuelans say they can't afford food, 47 percent say they can't afford shelter, just 15 percent say they are satisfied with the availability of quality health care and 35 percent say they are satisfied with their standard of living.
Thirty-six percent of Venezuelans, 51 percent of those between 15 and 29, say they would leave the country permanently if they could.
But if it is so clear that socialism is a formula for economic disaster, why does the idea still garner support?
In a Gallup poll of last year, 57 percent of Democrats, compared to 16 percent of Republicans, say they have a "positive view of socialism."
Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman says it's semantics.
Krugman mocks Trump, saying that "there is essentially no one in American political life who advocates such things" as government control of industry, as is the case in Venezuela.
When Democrats say "socialism," says Krugman, they really mean "social democracy" - a market economy with a social safety net and use of the tax system as an equalizer.
The issue really isn't how we technically define socialism. The issue is really the extent to which we are free.
What difference is it really if a firm is privately owned, but the government has vast latitude to regulate it? Or if a private firm pays me but government taxes away a large chunk of my pay?
Venezuela is the extreme case: total collapse as a result of political despots taking over everything.
But socialism is not like good wine, which, in moderation, might not hurt and might even be beneficial.
Every step in which economic freedom is cut back bears costs.
We see what is happening now, as the U.S. economy surges back to life as a result of cutting back regulations and taxes.
But America has entire communities in distress for the same reasons that Venezuela has fallen apart. Life in our poor communities is in the grip of socialism.
Government housing, government health care, government schools, government welfare programs.
There are 31 million people living in areas of high economic distress, now designated as "opportunity zones." The average poverty rate in these zones is 28.7 percent. The average household income is 40 percent below the national average, and 36.5 percent of prime-age adults are not working. Fifty-six percent of these 31 million are nonwhite minorities.
The president's new opportunity zone initiative, providing tax incentives to direct investment capital into these neighborhoods, aims to change realities with the same passion that the president spoke against socialism.
How do countries wind up going in the wrong direction?
British playwright George Bernard Shaw captured it when he said, "A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul."
Political demagogues tap into the frustrations of those who are struggling, or tap into the ambitions of those who long for power, and sell them Hollywood dreams - and lies - of a better life. Once they convince them to turn over power, the nightmare begins.

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Melissa Eddy, a Berlin correspondent for The Times, discussed the tech she's using.
What are the most important tech tools for doing your job, and how do you use them?
My iPhone X has become my multipurpose portable notebook, camera, recorder and connection device. I have typed breaking stories into the Notes app and sent them to editors, or jotted down key points from an event, when I found myself without pen and paper.
I've used the camera to record Facebook Live video, but also to take still photos of anything that catches my imagination when I am out reporting, or signs that I don't have time to stop and translate. When I sit down to write, I go back through my photos to jog my memory, although I sometimes worry that it would be better to pause and capture the thought in the moment.
I use the VoiceMemos app to record news conferences and in-person interviews. For phone interviews, I rely on TapeACall Pro, which is easy to use and has been a great addition.
Because many Germans use Android phones, I installed WhatsApp initially to keep in touch with my friends and kids. But increasingly, it is a popular way to communicate with sources. When we were reporting on the more than one million migrants who made their way to Germany in 2015 and 2016, most of them still had cellphones from their home countries, and the only way to reach them was via WhatsApp messages, or "Whatsies."
Google Maps, a German railway app and a local car-sharing app make up my essential travel tech trio. As a nation obsessed with keeping a paper trail, Germans were very cautious about using apps to make everyday transactions easier -- Apple Pay arrived only at the end of last year -- but the apps are catching on. It has been several years since I used a paper ticket on the train, and where car-sharing services like DriveNow initially required an extra card to unlock the car, now all I need is my phone.
Is there any tech that you've stopped using lately or use less, and why?
I have turned off Apple's FaceTime after the latest scandal over privacy, but I only ever used that to reach my 80-year-old father, who isn't on WhatsApp.
For years, I have been a lurker on Facebook and would like to quit it altogether, but I find it too useful for reporting. About 32 million of Germany's 82 million people are active on the platform. Some members of Germany's far-right and nationalist circles, including some members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, use Facebook almost exclusively to communicate with their base, so it has become increasingly useful for tracking their activities.
Germany has a reputation for being very privacy-conscious online. How have you seen that manifest itself?
Many public records are protected in Germany by strict privacy laws, which means that access in general is difficult and that records are not at all available online. The country still demands that applications for most official documents take place via paper or fax. Digital databases of information on individuals do not exist.
Searching for places in Germany on Google Street View returns a patchwork of images and blurred blotches. That's because in 2010, data privacy activists succeeded in forcing Google to allow them to render their residences unrecognizable. The irony is that Germans, who like to head into vacations hyper-prepared, love to look up their hotels or the cities they will visit on Google Street View.
Nothing in the Berlin public school system is digitized, and parents have to sign special waivers for their kids to have access to Wi-Fi in the schools that offer it. At the start of every school year, parents have to give permission for their email addresses to be shared on a class list, and those who don't will be left out.
That being said, Germans in their 20s and younger are as active on Instagram or Facebook as their counterparts in the United States. Yet despite being raised in a privacy-obsessed country, they seem to struggle with the idea that whatever they publish on Facebook can be seen publicly, unless they take special action to keep their entries private.
After the 2017 terror attack on a disco in Istanbul, I reached out to a group of friends of one of the victims from southern Germany. They had posted homages to him, and I wanted to use them and perhaps talk to them about their friend. But my attempts to reach out were met with hostility that I would be invading their privacy and "preying" on their mourning -- which they had made publicly available on Facebook.
What apps and gadgets do Germans love to use?
Germany's highly mechanized society seems to extend even to the act of cleaning teeth: Germans love electric toothbrushes. Young kids are started on smaller, battery-powered brushes, which become larger and more sophisticated as they grow. I have had to argue with my dentist that I am capable of keeping my teeth clean with good old-fashioned brushing and flossing.
Uber basically doesn't exist in Germany after they were largely forced to retreat from the market in 2015 for violating local transport laws. To be on the safe side, the taxi companies quickly realized they needed to create an app or eventually be left behind, so MyTaxi was born. It works the way Uber does elsewhere, but by connecting riders with taxis wherever they are in Germany -- even in tiny towns where the local taxi driver has to be pulled off his sofa in front of the TV to come pick you up at the station at some odd hour. To this day, I have never used Uber.
Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love to use and why?
Other than trying to keep up with the latest Netflix series and doing The Times's crossword puzzle, we are largely an analogue family. Monopoly and Scrabble will come out on the rare nights we are all together for a game.
My 17-year-old son is a YouTube junkie and is surviving his exams and studies by exchanging tips and notes with his peers around the world via Discord, the communication app. He recently wondered how anyone could have passed exams in the days before online resources were available.
Despite teaching herself to read via Starfall, an online program, my 14-year-old daughter prefers paper books to her Kindle. Germany still has a strong network of bookstores, and I try to support their continued existence by ordering books through them, but more often than not we turn to Amazon for easy access to English-language books.
People have always envied my having a bookworm for a child. But the frustrating part is that while I've never had any qualms removing an electronic device from someone, I have a much harder time pulling a book out of my daughter's hands, even when homework and chores need to be done.
In Tech We're Using, Times journalists give us a peek into the technology they love and use for work and life.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump likes to say that he hires only the best people and that his White House operates like a well-oiled machine.
But a steady stream of insider accounts flowing out of the West Wing suggests there's more madness than method to the president and his administration.
The most recent entries are two books that just hit best-seller lists, one by former White House aide Cliff Sims, the other by ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a onetime Trump adviser.
OPPOSING VIEW: Donald Trump wasn’t elected to just be conventional
Sims dishes about Oval Office back-stabbing in his explicitly titled "Team of Vipers. " Christie's "Let Me Finish" laments Trump's choice of "amateurs, grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons . . . hustled into jobs they were never suited for. "
The authors join a pantheon of disgruntled leakers or tattling ex-staffers telling tales of incompetence at the highest executive levels. Last week, someone handed Axios three months of Trump's daily schedule, revealing in mortifying detail how the president spends more than half of his workday in "executive time" activities such as watching TV, tweeting and making calls.
The consistent and growing evidence of internal dysfunction is growing increasingly difficult to ignore or explain away. Remember, these accounts aren't coming from Democrats or anti-Trump pundits. They're from people who have worked inside the administration and seen White House operations up close and personal:
►A senior Trump administration official, writing an anonymous column in The New York Times, characterized the president as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," with decisions that are "half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless. "
►Journalist Bob Woodward, in his best-selling book "Fear," diagnosed a White House suffering a "nervous breakdown," with aides stealing papers off Trump's desk to deter bad policy. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly was quoted as saying: "We're in Crazytown. "
►"Fire and Fury" by writer Michael Wolff and "Unhinged" by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the ex-White House aide and former television reality star, questioned the president's mental well-being.
Sprinkled throughout these tell-all tomes are unflattering assessments of the president by some of his top-drawer executives. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to Woodward, said Trump comprehends like a "fifth- or sixth-grader. " And former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has never denied multiple reports that he labeled Trump a "moron. "
Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
With more books in the pipeline, the Trump campaign is eager to try to enforce nondisclosure agreements signed by ex-staffers. What doesn't the White House want the public to know?
People who've served inside the Trump administration keep trying to warn the world that something is terribly awry. Americans ignore them at their peril.

Texto completo: Last month, I put my name to an agreement between NYCHA and the federal government that will make life better for the 400,000 of our neighbors who call public housing home.
I didn't do it lightly. And today I want to make clear to our residents why I signed it.
Given the tremendous respect and admiration I have for Stan Brezenoff, NYCHA's current interim chair, a legend in New York City, I find it extremely difficult to publicly disagree with him. Stan has made his opinion clear, as demonstrated in a recent New York Times interview. "The city and NYCHA have all the responsibility, limited authority and all of the financial burden," he said.
I feel the need to make my position equally clear, and to explain why I'm confident this deal will benefit all our residents in the months and years to come.
First, the agreement avoided what would have been a disastrous federal takeover of our public housing through receivership. Make no mistake: The risk was real.
I speak with residents every single day. They knew the risk of a federal takeover and the consequences it would carry for their families. And they made very clear to me that we had to fight for local control of NYCHA, and be willing to compromise to keep it.
Local control is vital to turning NYCHA around. While I wholeheartedly agree more changes are necessary to improve the lives of our residents, we've made progress over the past year. Fewer residents have faced heating outages this winter; we've slashed restoration times for outages down to 10 hours - and that's just the first wave of progress we are setting in motion. We are well on our way to replacing roofs at 900 buildings, on-time and on-budget, eliminating a major source of leaks and mold. The labor contract we just secured will bring residents seven-day service for the very first time.
The agreement is not perfect - negotiations never are - but it establishes a solid foundation to build on. The action plans set objectives to significantly improve on five important areas: lead, heat, elevators, mold and pests.
As we execute the plans and steadily improve conditions, the agreement provides opportunity for the Authority, working with a monitor appointed by the federal government, to make changes with the best interests of our residents as our primary objective.
Nobody has ever minimized the resources it will take to turn around NYCHA, particularly the resources we'll need from Washington along the way. But we're not naïve, either. If NYCHA is going to get more federal funding, it's going to be thanks to our allies in Congress, not the Trump administration.
As he has every year since taking office, Mayor de Blasio has stepped up with new resources for public housing residents. The agreement includes a city pledge of $2.2 billion over 10 years that will help make repairs and improve services. Paired with the city's new plan to fully renovate the apartments of 175,000 NYCHA residents, we have tools NYCHA has never had before. We can make $24 billion in repairs that will fundamentally improve people's homes.
Make no mistake: Washington must be creative in making additional funding available and granting us the regulatory relief we need to work faster. The state must release the $450 million previously allocated to NYCHA for heating plants and elevator replacements as soon as possible, and to work with us to secure additional funding.
I've dedicated my entire career to improving the lives and living conditions of New Yorkers, and now I carry that responsibility for my residents at NYCHA. I work for them, and I intend to keep the promise I made to them: to make their lives better one day at a time. I signed the agreement in my capacity as general manager because I know it will allow me to keep that promise.
Mustaciuolo is general manager at the New York City Housing Authority.

TROUBLING TWEETS LEFT-WING ANTI-SEMITISM IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM

Texto completo: Last October, after a crude mail bomb was found in George Soros' mailbox, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, tweeted, "We cannot allow Soros, Steyer and Bloomberg to buy this election!" The tweet, since deleted, was referring to Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, both of them, like Mr. Soros, Jews who are often the object of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Speaking on CNN, Mr. Steyer, who also had been sent a mail bomb, described Mr. McCarthy's tweet as a "straight-up anti-Semitic move."
So it was a bit rich when, last week, Mr. McCarthy posed as the indignant defender of the Jewish people, threatening to force congressional action against two freshman Democratic representatives, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, for their criticism of Israel.
It would have been easy enough for either Ms. Omar or Ms. Tlaib to point out Mr. McCarthy's cynical hypocrisy. Instead, Ms. Omar responded with a blithely incendiary tweet quoting Puff Daddy's ode to the power of money: "It's all about the Benjamins, baby." When an editor at The Forward, a Jewish publication, asked who Ms. Omar thinks is paying American politicians to be pro-Israel, she responded, "AIPAC!," meaning the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the United States' most prominent pro-Israel lobby.
Consciously or not, Ms. Omar invoked a poisonous anti-Semitic narrative about Jews using their money to manipulate global affairs. This came just weeks after she had to apologize for a 2012 tweet in which she said that Israel had "hypnotized" the world, phrasing that also recalled old canards about occult Jewish power. Her words were a gift to Republicans, who seek to divide the Democrats over Israel, even as their president traffics in anti-Semitic imagery and stereotypes. The knives were out for Ms. Omar and she ran right into them.
Monday afternoon, Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the House Democratic leadership rebuked Ms. Omar and called on her to apologize for her "use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel's supporters." It was a depressing fall from grace for someone who just weeks ago was being feted as a path breaker, a refugee from Somalia who, alongside Ms. Tlaib, rose to become one of America's first two Muslim congresswomen.
Ms. Omar herself has been subjected to vicious Islamophobic smears and has also come under attack for supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which seeks to use economic pressure on Israel to secure Palestinian rights. Perhaps such criticism is why she's sometimes seemed unwilling or unable to distinguish between disingenuous political pile-ons and good-faith calls to respect Jewish sensitivities. But whether from carelessness or callousness, her weekend tweets damaged her political allies and squandered some of her own hard-won power.
Also, at a moment when activists have finally pried open space in American politics to question our relationship with Israel, it's particularly incumbent on Israel's legitimate critics to avoid anything that smacks of anti-Jewish bigotry. And the idea of Jews as global puppet masters, using their financial savvy to make the gentiles do their bidding, clearly does.
In 2017, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, a left-wing, broadly anti-Israel group, put out a guide to help progressives understand anti-Semitism. It describes how in "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," the early-20th-century Russian forgery purporting to reveal a Jewish plan for world domination, "Jews are depicted as shadowy figures with a lot of money, top-level access, ready to betray the nations of our residence (and our neighbors) in service of an unseen authority."
Not long after Ms. Pelosi's statement, Ms. Omar released one of her own, apologizing "unequivocally." She wrote, "Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes." Personally, I'm happy to accept her apology. Progressive American Muslims and Jews should be natural allies; our mutual future depends on deepening this country's embattled commitment to multiethnic democracy. Prejudice helps bind the modern right together, but unchecked it can rip the left apart.

Cravings: Andy’s Salsa turns to dill pickles for inspiration

SALSA WITH A SPECIAL TANG
Andy Doka’s affinity for salsa has been apparent for 16 years, since he introduced Andy’s Bueno Salsa at Oahu farmers markets.
Doka’s regular and “black star” (spicy) salsas maintain a reputation for fresh, clean flavors, made locally.
Now he’s got something new: Andy’s Dill Pickle Chunky Salsa, still a tomato-based condiment, but studded with diced dills that add tanginess and texture.
Doka said the idea came from his daughters. “They diced up a pickle, threw it into my mild salsa and lay in wait for me to taste it and get mad.”
But he liked it, and started testing the new salsa at farmers markets. He introduced it at Kalapawai Market in Kailua in January.
Andy’s is in the middle of a tasting tour of select Safeway stores, a trial run for his pickle salsa. A 16-ounce container is selling at an introductory price of $6.49 through March 15.
Find Andy’s other salsas at most supermarkets and commisaries, Down to Earth, Whole Foods Market and at farmers markets — Kailua (Thursdays), Kapiolani Community College (Saturdays) and Mililani High School (Sundays).
— Betty Shimabukuro, Star-Advertiser
A NEW COKE
Coca-Cola is introducing its first new flavor in a decade — orange vanilla — appearing in stores starting Feb. 25.
Find it in cans and bottles in regular and sugar-free versions.
Coke is, by the way, 133 years old in 2019.
BUBBLES FOR YOUR VALENTINE
A vibrant cocktail, ruby-red and sparkling, will set the tone for an intimate Valentine’s dinner.
Called Los Amores and inspired by a Kir Royale, it was created by Patrick Timmis, beverage director for the Bien Trucha Group, a family-owned Mexican restaurant and catering company in Geneva, Ill.
How to: Muddle (crush) two ripe strawberries in a cocktail shaker, add 3/4 ounce each of lime juice and simple syrup, 1/4 ounce creme de cassis and an ounce of blanco tequila. Add ice, shake, then strain into a Champagne flute; top with a dry sparkling wine and garnish with a strawberry.
This makes one drink, but of course you would prepare enough for two. And consider making more to have refills ready.

Texto completo: Bye, bye, Batfleck. That's right — after appearing as the Caped Crusader in two widely panned blockbusters (2016's “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" and the following year's “Justice League"), Ben Affleck is out as Batman.
Though he was at one stage tipped to write, direct, and star in a standalone Batman movie, the writing has been on the wall since Warner Bros. and DC handed the project off to director Matt Reeves. Reeves — who scrapped Affleck's script in favor of a more suspenseful, noir-driven take on the character — had been widely expected to select his own Dark Knight. Affleck finally confirmed on Jan. 30 that he's hanging up the cowl.
As Reeves seeks a new star for “The Batman," set to hit theaters in 2021, we thought we'd offer up a few suggestions.
Darren Criss : The “Glee" actor went from a cappella singer to American psycho in FX's “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story." That's a pretty killer range, one that could lend itself to playing a character as tormented as Bruce Wayne. Criss, 32, would be new to the superhero fold, but he's overdue for a big-screen breakthrough, and the cruelty he communicated playing the murderous Andrew Cunanan could form the backbone of a darker, detective-styled Caped Crusader.
Henry Golding : The 31-year-old actor made for a thoroughly convincing billionaire playboy, all rakish grins and designer suits, in two of last year's biggest runaway hits. As a suave Singaporean scion in the rom-com “Crazy Rich Asians" and the seductive husband of a missing woman in “A Simple Favor," Golding proved he could radiate charm while offering tantalizing slivers of a dark side beneath the surface. As for channeling Bruce Wayne's vigilante alter ego, Golding's shirtless scenes in both films suggest he's already in crime-fighting shape.
Nicholas Hoult: The 29-year-old Brit would be a more outside-the-box choice to play Batman, but his predilection for disappearing into characters — across films as varied as “Mad Max: Fury Road," “X-Men: Days of Future Past," and “The Favourite" — bodes well for playing the Dark Knight (and smacks of Christian Bale's career prior to “Batman Begins"). Why not embrace the weirdness of a grown man dressing up as a bat to fight supervillains by casting an actor known for injecting pathos into the peculiar?
Michael B. Jordan : New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie recently tweeted a thread in which he persuasively reimagined Batman as a black American, one whose evolution into a toughened vigilante is informed by experiences with racial inequality. Bouie's thread was inspired by calls to cast Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya (“Get Out") as Batman but, for our money, Kaluuya's “Black Panther" co-star Michael B. Jordan would be a better fit. As Killmonger, he anchored his character's mission of vengeance in deep pain, undergoing martial arts and weapons training to nail his lethal nature. And in last year's “Creed II," reprising his role as a world-class boxer, he struggled with the very Wayne-esque need to avenge a fallen father. Jordan's one of the best dramatic actors we have and, if he and Reeves arrived at a shared vision for the character, the results would be groundbreaking.
Matt Bomer : DC already snapped up Bomer, known for playing stylish con artists (USA's “White Collar") and smoldering hunks (“Magic Mike"), to voice the bandage-wrapped Negative Man on its upcoming “Doom Patrol" series. But the actor's dashing good looks — and those piercing eyes — suggest he'd be well-suited to the role of an elusive playboy whose mind moves faster than his sports cars (though perhaps at the same clip as a Batmobile).
Steven Yeun: The “Walking Dead" alum's tragic arc on that series might suggest he's an ideal Jason Todd/Robin, the Batman protégé whose courage and resourcefulness make his comic-book fate all the more heartbreaking. But in current best foreign film Oscar nominee “Burning," Yeun plays a swaggering, sinister bachelor hiding unusual secrets; it's an unnerving performance that should put him in contention for the part of a psychologically complex, possibly sociopathic Batman. If Reeves wants to bring out the character's noirish side, an actor capable of channeling moral ambiguity is essential.
Robert Pattinson: Anyone who still looks at Pattinson and sees Edward Cullen from “Twilight" is at this point willfully out of the loop. The actor has since emerged as a formidable performer, drawn to the eccentric. Whether succumbing to fever in “The Lost City of Z" or plunging into New York's criminal underworld in “Good Time," Pattinson has shown his true colors as a nervy iconoclast in command of his craft. And Reeves's focus on Batman as a hard-nosed detective could be sharpened by Pattinson's penchant for brooding introspection.

A New Kind of Intelligence Test

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For the team of national security correspondents who sit along the west side of The New York Times's Washington bureau, there is almost nothing more revealing -- or, in the Trump era, more politically charged -- than an annual exercise mandated by Congress called the "Worldwide Threat Assessment." It is the one moment each year that the chiefs of America's biggest intelligence agencies -- the Central Intelligence Agency, the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, along with lesser-known but giant agencies that defend American troops or run spy satellites -- are required to explain what worries them, and to rank the threats facing the country.
In a public, declassified way, they have to summarize their judgments about whether the North Koreans will ever give up their arsenal, whether the Iranians are violating a nuclear deal that the United States has already renounced, and how much progress is being made defeating terror groups like the Islamic State.
That task has never been a straightforward one -- especially when an intelligence finding complicates, or undermines, a president's desired outcomes. President Barack Obama's director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., usually opened his testimony by complaining that he had to deliver those assessments in public -- naturally secretive, the intelligence leaders prefer to talk to Congress behind closed doors.
But in the Trump era, the task is infinitely more complicated: The intelligence chiefs know that every word they utter will be judged in the Oval Office by whether the independent, fact-based judgments of the roughly $80 billion intelligence enterprise promote or undercut Mr. Trump's instincts and policies.
So as my colleague Julian Barnes and I prepared for this year's testimony, I remembered the comment that the head of one of the agencies made to me during a holiday party in December. "My objective for the year," this official said, half-jokingly, "is to stay out of the president's Twitter feed."
No such luck. A day after the testimony at the very end of January -- and only after he had read the coverage that contrasted with his own descriptions of those problems -- the president erupted. "The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran," he tweeted, reacting to their conclusion that the mullahs in Iran are, for now, abiding by the 2015 agreement and are not producing new nuclear fuel for weapons.
He did not care for the assessment that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader Mr. Trump will meet in Vietnam this month, will not give up all of his nuclear weapons, no matter what the president wants to believe. "Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school," Mr. Trump tweeted. Then he summoned several of the chiefs to the White House and got them to agree, at least publicly, that the problem was not their conclusions, it was us -- the biased journalists covering the open, public testimony. The testimony, he wrote, was "mischaracterized by the media," and he assured everyone "we are very much in agreement on Iran, ISIS, North Korea, etc."
They are not, obviously -- just read the public document. But the moment crystallized one of the biggest challenges in covering national security issues in Washington these days: There's what the government believes and what the president wants to believe. And when you compare the two, you are charged with taking sides, or inciting disagreements, in an effort to tear down Mr. Trump or weaken America in front of its adversaries.
In the days running up to Mr. Trump's State of the Union address, more than one member of the administration accused me, my colleagues and The Times of deliberately highlighting those differences in an effort to provoke just the kind of reaction Mr. Trump had the morning after the testimony. Why don't you just write it straight, one asked? Just say what the intelligence chiefs said, and not try to compare it to the president's statements?
The answer is simple: We're not stenographers. Our readers expect us to use decades of experience, as foreign correspondents around the world and as reporters who have delved into unclassified and classified data for years, to provide context into what an intelligence report on some of the most complex problems in the world really means. And we must assess the question of whether the president is integrating, ignoring or rejecting the conclusions of the intelligence community before he makes decisions.
As Mr. Trump likes to point out, intelligence agencies are not infallible -- see "Iraq, nuclear weapons." But the core of our job is helping readers understand the difference between facts on the ground, the "assessments" or judgments of the intelligence community, and the policy decisions that result.
So it is news when Mr. Trump decides he is going to deal with the Saudi crown prince, because the relationship with the kingdom outweighs the import of the C.I.A. conclusion, with medium-to-high certainty, that he was deeply involved in the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. (Mr. Trump called the C.I.A.'s view "feelings" rather than an assessment.) And hiding behind the fact that the C.I.A. conclusion is classified, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did when asked about it the other day, does not silence the debate over how the United States should deal with a national leader suspected of being part of a murder conspiracy.
There was another reason to point out the differences: to prepare the country for the stark difference between the picture of the world the intelligence chiefs painted and the one Mr. Trump described last Tuesday night in his State of the Union address.
In Mr. Trump's telling, the flood of illegal immigrants from unguarded stretches of the southwestern border is the No. 1 threat the United States must address. But drug trafficking, cartels and the issues of the Mexican border do not appear in the report until Page 18, and then comparatively fleetingly.
In the intelligence community's judgment, it is cyber threats -- to our electric grid, our privacy and our election system -- that ranked No. 1, and occupied pages upon pages of the report. The intelligence chiefs, it turned out, are consumed by the long-term issues of the race with China over artificial intelligence and quantum computing, and whether we have enough programming and scientific talent in the pipeline to keep up, much less keep ahead. The issue never came up in the State of the Union address. Nor did the central conclusion of Mr. Trump's own national security strategy: that the chief concern today has to be the renewal of great-power competition between the United States, Russia and China.
Sometimes the news is in the reports, the testimony, the leaked documents. Sometimes, it's in the silences.

Renowned oceanographer aided Allied beach landings during World War II

Texto completo: Walter H. Munk, a world-renowned oceanographer who helped ensure the safety and success of Allied beach landings during World War II by devising ways to forecast the waves, and who fired what became known as the underwater "sound heard around the world" in search of greater understanding of climate change, died Feb. 8 at his home in the San Diego community of La Jolla. He was 101.
The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Mary Munk.
Long associated with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego, Dr. Munk was one of the most celebrated oceanographers of his era - a scientist who devoted nearly eight decades to unraveling such questions as where waves begin, why they may break violently or wash ashore gently, how sound travels thousands of miles through water, and what information that journey might reveal about the global ecosystem.
His "genius lay in divining the interlocked patterns beneath the seeming clutter and chaos of the world's oceans," Josh Horwitz, who profiled Dr. Munk in his book "War of the Whales," wrote in an email. "He was revered in equal measure by surfers and navy admirals for his oracular ability to predict when far-off waves would break on beaches."
Much like the surfers of popular imagination, Dr. Munk found a home on the beaches of California, where he had fled to avoid a life on Wall Street. Born in Vienna to an affluent banking family, he had come to the United States in the early 1930s to attend a boarding school in New York and to carry on the family profession. But he soon discovered that he despised banking, bought a convertible and set out for the West Coast.
He abandoned finance for science, eventually landing at Scripps, where he apprenticed himself to the director, Harald Sverdrup, a leading oceanographer of his day.
In 1938, Nazi Germany annexed Austria and accelerated a campaign of anti-Semitic persecution. Dr. Munk, whose family had Jewish roots, became a U.S. citizen and served briefly in the Army before beginning what would be his seminal research for the Navy.
Dr. Munk credited Sverdrup with playing a leading role in the development of wave forecasting, which military strategists used in the planning of the amphibious landing on North Africa in 1942, in the Normandy invasion in 1944 and throughout the Pacific.
The publication New Scientist credited Dr. Munk with saving "countless lives by helping the Allied military determine when troops could make amphibious landings without being swamped by big surf hundreds of meters from a hostile shore."
Later in his career, he attracted wide attention, as well as some controversy, by using ocean acoustics to measure ocean temperatures, and thus to better understand climate change.
"Munk had an idea," Enric Sala, a marine ecologist and National Geographic Society explorer-in-residence, wrote in an email, describing an experiment that Dr. Munk led near Heard Island, in the southern Indian Ocean, in 1991. Understanding that sound travels more quickly in warm water than it does in cold water, Dr. Munk sent low-frequency sounds through the ocean. Even the test signal was detected in Bermuda.
"I still can't believe that happened," Dr. Munk told the San Diego Union-Tribune years later. "We hadn't even started the main experiment."
Through the experiment, Sala said, Dr. Munk "was able to prove at such large scales for the first time that different oceans were warming at different speeds." Such acoustic tests encountered some opposition from marine biologists who feared that they might interfere with migratory patterns of whales and other animals.
For the wide-ranging nature and applications of his work, Dr. Munk was dubbed the "Einstein of the oceans," a comparison that Dr. Munk rejected. "Einstein was a great man," he once told the Union-Tribune. "I was never on that level."
Walter Heinrich Munk was born on Oct. 19, 1917. His father served for a period as chauffeur to Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria. Years later, in an interview with the New York Times, Dr. Munk recalled that his father had "the only Rolls-Royce in Vienna." He often recalled the DeSoto convertible that he drove from New York to his new life in California.
He attended the California Institute of Technology, where he received a bachelor's degree in physics in 1939 and a master's degree in geophysics in 1940, and the University of California at Los Angeles, where he received a PhD in oceanography in 1947.
After the war, Dr. Munk provided scientific support for the nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll. "It's stunning; it's horrible," he told the Associated Press years later. "It's not dark, it's quite white. You see the boiling and the water vapor above you, like a curtain coming down all around you."
Throughout the Cold War and beyond, he served with the Jasons, a group of scientists advising the U.S. military.
His first marriage, to Martha Chapin Munk, ended in divorce, and his second wife, the former Judith Horton, died in 2006 after more than 50 years of marriage. Survivors include his wife of seven years, the former Mary Coakley of La Jolla; two daughters from his second marriage, Kendall Munk of State College, Pa., and Edie Munk of La Jolla; and three grandsons. Another daughter from his second marriage, Lucian, died at 7 of a heart ailment.
Dr. Munk's honors included the National Medal of Science, bestowed on him by President Ronald Reagan in 1983, and a 1999 Kyoto Prize in basic sciences. Horwitz recalled that when Dr. Munk accepted the 2010 Crafoord Prize in Geosciences from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences - an award often compared to the Nobel, recognizing a career that touched on waves and polar ice caps and warming seas - he opened a lecture about climate change by citing from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's classic poem "Kubla Khan":
The shadow of the dome of pleasure
Floated midway on the waves;
Where was heard the mingled measure
From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!

Texto completo: Bye, bye, Batfleck. That's right — after appearing as the Caped Crusader in two widely panned blockbusters (2016's “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" and the following year's “Justice League"), Ben Affleck is out as Batman.

Bouie's thread was inspired by calls to cast Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya (“Get Out") as Batman but, for our money, Kaluuya's “Black Panther" co-star Michael B. Jordan would be a better fit. As Killmonger, he anchored his character's mission of vengeance in deep pain, undergoing martial arts and weapons training to nail his lethal nature. And in last year's “Creed II," reprising his role as a world-class boxer, he struggled with the very Wayne-esque need to avenge a fallen father. Jordan's one of the best dramatic actors we have and, if he and Reeves arrived at a shared vision for the character, the results would be groundbreaking.
Matt Bomer : DC already snapped up Bomer, known for playing stylish con artists (USA's “White Collar") and smoldering hunks (“Magic Mike"), to voice the bandage-wrapped Negative Man on its upcoming “Doom Patrol" series. But the actor's dashing good looks — and those piercing eyes — suggest he'd be well-suited to the role of an elusive playboy whose mind moves faster than any of his sports cars (though perhaps at the same clip as a Batmobile).
Steven Yeun: The “Walking Dead" alum's tragic arc on that series might suggest he's an ideal Jason Todd/Robin, the Batman protégé whose courage and resourcefulness make his comic-book fate all the more heartbreaking. But in current Best Foreign Film Oscar nominee “Burning," Yeun plays a swaggering, sinister bachelor hiding unusual secrets; it's an unnerving performance that should put him in contention for the part of a psychologically complex, possibly sociopathic Batman. If Reeves wants to bring out the character's noirish side, an actor capable of channeling moral ambiguity is essential.
Robert Pattinson: Anyone who still looks at Pattinson and sees Edward Cullen from “Twilight" is at this point willfully out of the loop. The actor has since emerged as a formidable performer, drawn to the eccentric. Whether succumbing to fever in “The Lost City of Z" or plunging into New York's criminal underworld in “Good Time," Pattinson has shown his true colors as a nervy iconoclast in command of his craft. And Reeves' focus on Batman as a hard-nosed detective could be sharpened by Pattinson's penchant for brooding introspection.

Texto completo: Jeff Bezos, the digital retail titan and media baron, took to the internet on Thursday evening to defend himself. In a remarkable post on Medium.com, he accused the National Enquirer - the flamethrower-cum-garbage-bin owned by American Media Inc. and overseen by its publisher, David Pecker - of blackmail and extortion.
The Enquirer, you see, recently told Bezos that it had come into possession of several potentially embarrassing photos. The scandal sheet had already published an expose on Bezos’s extramarital affair and that story included private text messages and photos, which spurred him to hire investigators to find out how the Enquirer got its hands on all that stuff.
The new round of 10 photos includes, according to Bezos, four yawners (i.e., “a selfie of Mr. Bezos fully clothed”), three so-whats (of his mistress), and three what-was-he-thinkings (involving the Amazon.com Inc. founder and Washington Post owner’s penis). AMI threatened to publish the new photos unless Bezos called off his investigation, according to copies of email correspondence he shared. In other words, AMI warned, we are threatening to make use of your private property, Jeff, in order to stop your inquiry into how we got our hands on your private property.
There’s another important wrinkle here: Pecker is a longtime friend, political supporter and confidant of President Donald Trump, and Bezos, Amazon and the Washington Post have been repeated targets of the president’s ire. Trump has complained that Amazon gets preferential tax and postal rates; in December the U.S. Postal Service proposed rate hikes on shipping services Amazon and other companies use after Trump ordered an audit of the agency’s rates (the USPS has said the proposed hikes were not in response to Trump’s criticisms of Amazon). The Washington Post, of course, has published seminal and award-winning coverage of Trump’s political and business dealings as well as his shortcomings, legal perils, and personal life.
Pecker guided the Enquirer’s coverage of Trump down a very different path than the Post. Back in the summer of 2015, shortly after Trump announced his presidential bid, Trump and his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, met with Pecker to talk about how best to bury negative news stories about Trump’s extramarital relationships with women. Pecker, who entered into a cooperation agreement with authorities in 2018 that granted him immunity from prosecution, has told law enforcement officials that he agreed to purchase possibly damaging stories about Trump and never publish them in the Enquirer - a practice known as “catch and kill.” Among those stories were accounts of Trump’s sexual encounters with a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Cohen’s payments to McDougal (and to another woman, a former porn star named Stormy Daniels) triggered a federal investigation of possible campaign finance fraud.
Pecker may be sitting on years of Enquirer stories about Trump that were never published and would presumably be of interest to authorities. It’s not clear if Bezos’s revelations on Thursday night will complicate matters for Pecker.
Under AMI’s own agreement to assist law enforcement, the company won’t be prosecuted and must cooperate for three years. Signed last September, the agreement clearly states that if the company engages in any criminal acts after that date then it could be prosecuted for “any federal criminal violation” that authorities already know about. That fact, Trump’s presence, and all of the other very obvious politics floating around this collision of money, power and gossip, may explain why AMI tried to wring a false statement out of Bezos in exchange for not publishing the new photos. Specifically, AMI demanded, per Bezos’s Medium post, that he assert publicly that he has “no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.”
Ah, but AMI has tried to bully the wrong person. Bezos is the world’s richest man, he has ample resources and a spine, and he’s willing to put his own reputation in play before the Enquirer does - in order to make a point and to discover how the publication got his texts and photos.
“Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because there’s a much more important matter involved here. If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?” Bezos wrote of his exchanges with the company. “These communications cement AMI’s long-earned reputation for weaponizing journalistic privileges, hiding behind important protections, and ignoring the tenets and purpose of true journalism. Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.”
Bezos points out in his post that in addition to Trump considering him an enemy, Saudi Arabia - which has business ties to AMI and Pecker and the Trumps - might feel the same way due to the “Post’s essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder of its columnist Jamal Khashoggi.”
Old-fashioned envy may be at a work here, too. Bezos has a fortune estimated to be worth about $134 billion, which likely grates on Trump given that the president’s own net worth is a fraction of the wildly inflated $10 billion he sometimes claims to have. (Trump unsuccessfully sued me for libel for a biography I wrote called “TrumpNation,” citing unflattering sections of the book that examined his business record and wealth - and which he said damaged his reputation.) Bezos explains in his Medium post how he made his money, while also fileting AMI’s rationale for threatening to publish the photos:
“AMI’s claim of newsworthiness is that the photos are necessary to show Amazon shareholders that my business judgment is terrible. I founded Amazon in my garage 24 years ago, and drove all the packages to the post office myself. Today, Amazon employs more than 600,000 people, just finished its most profitable year ever, even while investing heavily in new initiatives, and it’s usually somewhere between the #1 and #5 most valuable company in the world. I will let those results speak for themselves.”
For his part, AMI’s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, notes in his correspondence with Bezos that the private photos he got his hands on were “obtained during our newsgathering.” Really? If AMI paid someone to hack Bezos’s devices to steal photos and texts, or if AMI received purloined photos and texts from a third party, then I wouldn’t call that “newsgathering” - in much the same way that I wouldn’t call Russian hackers burglarizing the Democratic National Committee’s servers “opposition research.” I’d call both things for what they are: theft.
Bezos has undoubtedly exercised bad judgment and camera skills in all of this, and he has possibly caused his wife acute pain. Working conditions at Amazon have also drawn criticism recently and the company’s size and reach need monitoring. But Bezos has also chosen to joust with the most powerful man in the world and with a potent publication that aided and abetted the president’s ascent. And he’s doing so in the service of the straightforward and indispensable idea that people are entitled to have private lives and private moments that strangers can’t pickpocket.
Three cheers for Jeff Bezos.

How GuaidÃ³ took the reins of Venezuela’s revolt

Texto completo: CARACAS, Venezuela — For about an hour, it looked as though the short, brilliant career of Juan GuaidÃ³ was over. GuaidÃ³, a youthful Venezuelan opposition leader, was driving to a rally outside Caracas on Jan. 13, when someone yanked open the door of his blue Ford Explorer. Masked men clutching assault weapons grabbed him, shoved him into a white van and sped off. "It’s a kidnapping!" GuaidÃ³’s supporters tweeted, as a video of the capture ricocheted around the Internet.
And then, mysteriously, GuaidÃ³ was freed. Condemnation of the operation — carried out by President NicolÃ¡s Maduro’s feared intelligence agency — poured in from around the hemisphere. Within hours, GuaidÃ³ was telling cheering supporters: "We are not afraid!"
"This began to create the legend of Juan GuaidÃ³," said Pedro Burelli, a Venezuelan opposition activist based in Washington.
Today, GuaidÃ³, a 35-year-old politician who was virtually unknown abroad just two months ago, is recognized as the interim president of Venezuela by most Western countries. GuaidÃ³ — a low-key, baseball-loving engineer elected to congress in 2015 — is fielding calls from President Donald Trump and other leaders and addressing massive protests. For the first time since coming to power in 2013, Maduro’s authoritarian, quasi-socialist government is in danger of falling.
The story of GuaidÃ³’s rise involves stealthy travel, diplomatic maneuvers in Washington, Canada and South America, and months of strategizing by Venezuelan activists. But it is also the story of an accidental leader who assumed his party’s mantle at the moment when it suddenly mattered.
For Trump, Venezuela has been a priority from his first week in office, when he surprised his national security team by calling for a briefing on the oil-rich country veering toward economic collapse. "He wanted to know what we were doing and how we could do more," recalled Fernando Cutz, a former staffer who participated in the session.
But perhaps the most crucial event in GuaidÃ³’s ascension was a decision on Jan. 4 by Canada and a dozen Latin American countries not to recognize Maduro when he was sworn in for a second term Jan. 10. The bloc’s foreign ministers — meeting in the Peruvian capital in a forum known as the Lima Group —had already condemned last year’s Venezuelan election as fraudulent.
"The trigger was the Lima Group’s declaration," said Julio Borges, an influential Venezuelan opposition leader exiled in Colombia. "They didn’t recognize Maduro, so it was clear executive powers had to be transferred to the legislature."
The next day, the legislature swore in its new leader: Juan Gerardo GuaidÃ³.
Venezuela’s opposition has long been led by wealthy light-skinned professionals who dominated politics and business before the rise of leftist Hugo ChÃ¡vez in the late 1990s. GuaidÃ³’s upbringing was more modest. The son of a commercial pilot and a teacher, he had six siblings and half-siblings. When he was 16, flash floods hit his hometown on the Caribbean coast, killing several of his friends. "The importance of resilience has been etched into my soul ever since," he wrote recently in The New York Times.
He studied engineering at Andres Bello Catholic University, but politics quickly emerged as his passion. "He started working with these student activists, and then it became his life," his younger brother Gustavo recalled. In 2007, Juan GuaidÃ³ helped lead student protests against the ChÃ¡vez government.
GuaidÃ³ soon began working with Leopoldo LÃ³pez, a charismatic Harvard-educated former mayor and opposition leader who would form the Popular Will movement in 2009. LÃ³pez was later jailed on what were widely viewed as trumped-up charges of inciting violence, but he was released to house arrest in 2017.
This past summer, despite the presence of intelligence police around his home in Caracas, LÃ³pez began an intense round of strategy sessions with GuaidÃ³ and opposition activists such as Borges, MarÃ­a Corina Machado and Antonio Ledezma, using encrypted channels.
Their strategy was to refuse to recognize Maduro after his Jan. 10 inauguration. But the activists debated whether to form a transition council or do something bolder — invoke a constitutional clause to pronounce the head of the opposition-dominated congress the temporary head of state. Never mind that Maduro had largely sidelined the congress, known as the National Assembly. "We spent hours and days deciding what to do," said Borges.
LÃ³pez’s Popular Will party was to assume the leadership of the congress in early January. With many of the party’s officials detained or in exile, GuaidÃ³ was chosen in November as its standard-bearer.
"GuaidÃ³’s low-key background helped people trust him, and he also had a good relationship with other parties," said a senior party official.
Suddenly, foreign countries noticed the long-squabbling opposition coming together.

Texto completo: Following weeks of speculation, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has finally confirmed that this year's Oscars ceremony will not have a host. Karey Burke, entertainment chief at ABC, the network that will carry the show, addressed this development during an event for the Television Critics Association's winter press tour.

"The main goal, which I was told was what the academy promised ABC last year, after a very lengthy telecast, was to keep the show to three hours," Burke said. "So the producers, I think, wisely decided to not have a host and to go back to having the presenters and the movies be the stars, and that will be the best way that we kind of keep the show at a brisk three hours."

The academy announced its intentions to limit the telecast to three hours last August, a few months before Burke was hired. That change seemed to be a reaction to a continuing decline in viewership, as last year's nearly four-hour telecast dropped 19 percent in viewers from the prior year's and hit an all-time low of only 26.5 million viewers. (Nonetheless, the ceremony's director went on to win an Emmy in September.) The announcement also included a controversial new category recognizing achievement in "popular film," which the academy delayed after a significant amount of backlash.

This year's Oscars ceremony seems to have been shaped by public fury more than any other in recent history. Soon after comedian Kevin Hart was named host in early December, several of his old homophobic tweets and jokes resurfaced, sparking widespread outrage. He issued an apology and eventually backed out, went on Ellen DeGeneres's talk show and said he'd reconsider the gig after she vouched for him, but eventually backed out again.

An already undesirable job became even more so.

"There was a messiness behind the Kevin Hart situation," Burke said. "After that it was pretty clear that we were going to stay the course. There was an idea that we were going to just have presenters host the Oscars, and we all got onboard with that idea pretty quickly."

As uncertainty among the public lingered, the academy fiddled more with the ceremony's structure in an effort to keep the three-hour promise. Rumors spread that best cinematography would be one of multiple technical categories to be awarded during commercial breaks, deepening fears that had been around since August. Variety reported in late January that only two of the five Oscar-nominated songs -- likely Kendrick Lamar and SZA's "All the Stars" from "Black Panther," plus Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's "Shallow" from "A Star Is Born" -- would be performed live, and the other three would only be acknowledged when the nominees are named.

This time, the outrage even reached "Mary Poppins Returns" star Lin-Manuel Miranda, known for his sunny disposition on Twitter. He quote-tweeted Variety's report and wrote, "If true, and Poppins' song won't be performed, truly disappointing. Hostless AND music-less? To quote Kendrick: Damn." New York Times Carpetbagger columnist Kyle Buchanan took note of this rare negativity in a piece titled "Are the Oscars Ashamed to Be the Oscars?" The Atlantic published an article accusing the academy of being "prepared to sell its soul" for stronger ratings.

The academy eventually reversed course and tweeted late last week that all five nominated songs would, indeed, be performed during the telecast -- reports otherwise were "premature and only reflective of a proposal," insiders told Deadline. But the trade outlet added that either Lady Gaga or her representatives had made it clear that they wanted all five songs to be performed out of fairness to other nominees, and "that she wouldn't perform if a chance wasn't made." Each performance will reportedly last just 90 seconds so the telecast doesn't surpass three hours, further proving the academy's commitment to the limit.

All that said, getting rid of the host won't necessarily prevent controversy. The only other time the Oscars ceremony has been hostless throughout its 91-year history was in 1989, when an actress dressed as Snow White and Rob Lowe, her Prince Charming, painfully made their way through a 15-minute opening musical number that left audience members disgusted. "The show itself looked like a gay bar mitzvah," the actress recalled to the Hollywood Reporter in 2013.

Burke told television critics Tuesday that this year's ceremony would still include "an exciting opening."

Texto completo: White House won't send report to Congress on slain journalist
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration was set to ignore a Friday deadline for giving the Senate a full accounting of the role of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in the brutal slaying of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi four months ago.
The administration, which has consistently sought to shield Saudi rulers from blame, had until midnight Friday to answer senators' questions about whether Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, as U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded, and what additional sanctions should be placed on the government in Riyadh.
The deadline was set by Democratic and Republican senators, who wrote the president on Oct. 10 -- slightly more than a week after Khashoggi's disappearance -- calling for an investigation.
Senators said Trump was obliged by law to answer within 120 days. Administration officials contended, however, that the law was not binding and that the president could ignore the senators' demands.
A top Saudi official, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir, on Friday insisted the crown prince had no role in Khashoggi's slaying, saying the trial of the suspects and the ongoing investigation would show it was a "rogue operation" with no official backing.
The New York Times reported Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted a 2017 conversation in which Mohamed told a top aide that he would use "a bullet" on Khashoggi, a regime critic, if he did not return home to Saudi Arabia.

Fire at Brazilian soccer academy kills 10, injures 3
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Fire tore through the sleeping quarters of an academy for one of Brazil's most popular professional soccer clubs Friday, killing 10 people and injuring three, most likely teenage players, authorities said.
Firefighters were called just after 5 a.m. local time to the sprawling Ninho de Urubu training grounds of the Flamengo soccer club in Rio de Janeiro.
The cause of the fire was not known.
Those killed were not immediately identified by the club but they were athletes, a health official said.
Two of the injured youths were hospitalized in stable condition and one was in critical condition. The ages of the injured were 14, 15 and 16, according to a fire official.
Several people who appeared to be relatives entered the complex without speaking to reporters.

Stone says he should be free to speak in Russia probe case
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge shouldn't bar longtime Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone from making public statements about his criminal case in the Russia investigation, his attorneys said Friday.
Defense lawyers say in a court filing that any limits on Stone's public comments would infringe on his right to free speech.
They made the argument as U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is considering a gag order preventing both sides in the case from making public statements that could prejudice potential jurors.
Jackson raised the issue last week as she told Stone not to treat his criminal case like a "book tour," referring to post-indictment talk show appearances Stone made in which he attacked the investigation as politically motivated.

Iran's top leader defends chants of 'Death to America' by crowds
TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is defending "Death to America" chants that are standard fare at anti-U.S. rallies across Iran but says the chanting is aimed at America's leaders and not its people.
Khamenei's website on Friday quoted him as saying the chant means "death to U.S. leaders, death to (President Donald) Trump and John Bolton and (Mike) Pompeo."
He says the Iranian people "will not stop saying 'Death to America' as long as the U.S. acts malicious" toward Iran.
Khamenei was referring to Trump's State of the Union address this week in which the American president, among other things, said: "We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants 'Death to America.' "

France presses Italy in historic EU dispute
PARIS -- France's pro-EU government and Italy's populist leaders sparred anew Friday amid the neighbors' biggest diplomatic spat since World War II.
French officials said Friday that this week's recall of French Ambassador Christian Masset was prompted by months of "unfounded attacks" from Italian government members Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, who have criticized French President Emmanuel Macron's economic and migration policies.
But the main trigger for the crisis appeared to be Di Maio's meeting in a Paris suburb this week with members of the yellow vests -- a French anti-government movement seeking seats in the European Parliament -- without informing French leaders, who considered it an unwarranted intrusion into the nation's internal affairs.

Steep fall in enforcement by EPA seen since 2016
WASHINGTON -- Civil and criminal crackdowns on polluters dropped sharply in the second year of the Trump administration, according to 2018 enforcement figures released Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Trump administration EPA says the agency is taking a new tack with polluters, giving states more of a role in regulation and enforcement and stressing education and voluntary compliance with offenders as well as fines and criminal prosecution.
The EPA has been one of the most active agencies overall in carrying out the deregulatory goals of President Donald Trump.
Declines include civil investigations carried out by the agency, which fell to 22 last year, down from 40 in 2017 and 125 in 2016, the last year of the Obama administration.

Health exam: President Donald Trump is "in very good health" and expected to remain healthy for "the duration of his Presidency, and beyond," the president's doctor said Friday after a physical exam by 11 specialists. The White House did not release more details and did not say whether any would be released.

Summit location: President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will hold their second summit in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi on Feb. 27-28, the president said Friday night. The president had previously announced Vietnam as the summit location, but the city hadn't been identified.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
As The New York Times's crossword editor, I get pitched on new puzzle ideas all the time. Most of them, sadly, wouldn't have a wide audience, in my opinion. For some puzzles, The Times is not a good venue.
So it was in 2007, when a game agent, fresh from a toy fair in Japan, called to say he had a new puzzle that he'd like to show me, and he'd like to do it in person. I said no -- mail it in.
But he was insistent. Also, he lived near my home, making a visit easy, and he promised he wouldn't take more than 15 minutes. Reluctantly, I said O.K.
The puzzle he showed me was KenKen, the grid-logic puzzle that officially celebrates its 10th anniversary in The Times today. From this you can probably gather approximately what happened in that meeting in 2007. The agent, Bob Fuhrer, gave me an easy example of KenKen, which I readily did. I asked for another, which I also did. Then I asked Mr. Fuhrer to leave me the KenKen book he'd brought from Japan. By the following week, after having finished virtually the entire book (including working way past bedtime most nights), I was completely hooked.
KenKen is the invention of Tetsuya Miyamoto, a Japanese educator who runs a private, after-school academy for children in Tokyo. The academy operates on the principle of "teaching without teaching." That is, Mr. Miyamoto believes that the best education occurs when students are self-motivated. He invented KenKen as a means to teach students math. Some of his students liked KenKen so much that they gave up TV and video games to do his puzzles.
Two years after my meeting with Mr. Fuhrer, The Times was looking for a new puzzle to add to the daily paper, to supplement the crossword, and I recommended KenKen. It's simple to explain. It doesn't take much room. And as a non-word puzzle, it appeals to a different sort of reader.
The first KenKen appeared in The Times on Feb. 9, 2009 -- The Times was the first American newspaper to run the puzzle -- and it was an immediate success. It went on nytimes.com in 2008 and was added to the Sunday Magazine in 2010. Since then it has spread around the world. It now appears in more than 200 newspapers and publications internationally. It has attracted a large, fiercely loyal audience, spawning books, an annual international championship and an educational program with puzzles for teachers to use in school. Almost 150 million KenKen puzzles have been played on nytimes.com alone.
All the KenKen puzzles for The Times are electronically generated using software from the British chess grandmaster David Levy. His program knows every possible method for solving a KenKen, which he has rated in difficulty from easy to hard. Thus, when a KenKen has been made, the computer knows exactly how hard it is.
The KenKen puzzles in The Times, which vary in size up to 7x7 squares, are generally easy to medium-hard, depending on the day of the week. Mondays are the easiest. Saturdays are the hardest.
For this anniversary, Tetsuya Miyamoto has handcrafted a special 9x9 KenKen. Find it on Page A2 of Saturday's print paper. And you can always play six new puzzles each day at nytimes.com/kenken.

PG&amp;E's Wildfire Plan: Cut Power and Raise Rates

Texto completo: Pacific Gas and Electric, the troubled California utility, said on Wednesday that it would cut off power during dry and windy weather more frequently, trim more trees along its power lines and spend as much as $2.3 billion to reduce the risk of wildfires.
Yet despite all of that, PG&E said, "preventing wildfires outright is likely impossible."
The company and other California utilities, whose equipment has been blamed for starting fires that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed dozens of people, detailed those plans in filings with state regulators in advance of the 2019 wildfire season, which starts in June. It was the first time the utilities had made such filings, which were required by a state law passed last year.
PG&E submitted its plan a week after the company filed for bankruptcy protection in the face of tens of billions of dollars in liability from two years of deadly wildfires. The utility, the state's largest, has blamed development in remote areas and climate change as major contributors to the severity of wildfires in its 70,000-square-mile service area. But the company's critics assert that it has not done enough to reduce the fire risk posed by its power lines, conductors and other equipment.
The California Public Utilities Commission will review the plans after holding hearings and soliciting public comments. Six utilities submitted reports, but experts say the commission will spend the most time on PG&E's plan given the company's financial problems and its size: The utility serves 16 million people in central and Northern California, or about 40 percent of the state's population.
Here are some of the highlights from PG&E's fire plan.
Residents should expect more blackouts
PG&E says it will become more willing to cut off power in areas that are very dry and where severe winds or other weather could cause equipment failures. The utility started using blackouts last fall.
The utility said it would use computer models developed by San Diego Gas and Electric to figure out when to switch off electricity to vulnerable areas. In its nearly 200-page report, PG&E repeatedly cited the San Diego utility for its successful use of blackouts, enhanced weather tracking and other steps to prevent severe wildfires.
PG&E says it will install 400 new weather stations this year, twice as many as the utility added in 2018.
"The specific area and number of affected customers will depend on forecasted weather conditions and which circuits PG&E needs to turn off for public safety," the company said in a statement to The New York Times. "This means that any customer who receives electric service from PG&E should be prepared for a possible public safety power outage."
Mark Toney, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, which represents consumers, said blackouts should be a temporary solution.
"To us, that's an emergency response, but it should not be the long-term response," Mr. Toney said. "We are paying PG&E to provide electrical service. I think it kind of upsets people now we have to pay them to shut off the power."
The company will inspect lines and trim trees more often
Fire investigators determined that PG&E's equipment was responsible for 17 of the 21 major wildfires in 2017. In many of those cases, dead or diseased trees or branches fell onto power lines. As a result, PG&E said, it will more than double the number of trees it removes and greatly increase inspections of power poles and towers.
PG&E power lines pass through more dense forests than do those of the state's other investor-owned utilities, San Diego Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. As a result, PG&E argues, the company's equipment is more likely to start wildfires.
After reviewing five years of vegetation-related fire ignitions in the high-risk areas, PG&E said 10 species of trees, including the black oak, the gray pine and the tanoak, were responsible for most of the fires.
Customers will pay more for electricity
Inspecting power lines and making improvements to poles, towers and other equipment could cost PG&E between $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion this year. Those costs will eventually be passed on to customers in the form of higher rates after the utilities commission approves the company's mitigation plan.
The state's Public Advocates Office and consumer groups said they were reviewing the plan and its costs. Some have already raised concern that the utility, which has been convicted of multiple felonies and is under scrutiny by a federal judge for probation violations, is asking customers to pay for steps that the groups say should have been completed and paid for under previous funding requests or as part of the company's normal operations.
The utilities commission "needs to hold PG&E accountable for the billions of dollars we've already been giving them for safety," Mr. Toney said. "We're worried right now that no amount of money is going to be enough."

Texto completo: Right now, with snow blanketing our neighborhoods, parks and rooftops, would be a good time to read or reread Robert Bly’s “Silence in the Snowy Fields.” His first poetry collection, it came out in 1962 from Wesleyan Press. It was 66 pages long, softcover and cost two dollars. When you opened it, these were the first lines you read:
Sometimes, riding in a car, in Wisconsin
Or Illinois, you notice those dark telephone poles
One by one lift themselves out of the fence line
And slowly leap on the gray sky –
And past them, the snowy fields.
If you were a poet, or inclined toward poetry, or curious about poetry, or had to read poetry for a class you were taking, maybe you were hooked. Bly’s words, recorded over 60 years in 14 books of poetry (not counting his many books of translations), influenced generations of poets and readers.
Bly’s latest and last book, “Robert Bly: Collected Poems,” was published in December by W.W. Norton. It gathers all 14 of his poetry books on 576 pages between sturdy hard covers. On Monday (Feb. 11), a host of family members, friends, fellow poets and scholars will convene at Plymouth Congregational Church to celebrate the book, read favorite poems and honor Bly, who was born in Minnesota and, except for a few years in the Navy, at Harvard and in New York, has lived here all his life. (Bly was Minnesota’s first poet laureate.)
At 92, Bly doesn’t get out much anymore, so we don’t expect to see him at Plymouth. He gave his final public reading there in 2015, as part of Plymouth’s Literary Witnesses series. Bly’s longtime friend, great supporter and fellow poet Jim Lenfestey ran that series for 15 years. The University of Minnesota held a big Bly conference in 2009 because Lenfestey organized it. The U’s Elmer L. Andersen Library has Bly’s papers because Lenfestey co-chaired the committee that raised the money to acquire them. Lenfestey, who made sure Monday’s event would happen, will be there.
So will a host of others. Bly’s biographer, Mark Gustafson, will open the event, after which a parade of fans and admirers will take the podium. These will include Bly’s editor, Thomas R. Smith; Rain Taxi’s Eric Lorberer (Rain Taxi is co-sponsoring the event); the Loft’s Britt Udesen; poet Freya Manfred and her artist sons, Rowan and Bly Pope; videographer Mike Hazard; William Duffy, co-founder with Bly of the seminal literary magazine The Fifties; singer Prudence Johnson; and poets Mary Moore Easter, Louis Jenkins, Jim Moore, Matt Rasmussen and Cary Waterman.
Zachary Cohen, principal bass for the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, will make music. Birchbark will offer books for sale, and a broadside by fine printer and wood engraver Gaylord Schanilec created for the event will be available for purchase. 7 p.m. FMI. Free.
Here’s Club Book’s winter/spring lineup of authors
A Peabody-winning journalist, a No. 1 New York Times best-selling historian and a Top Chef finalist are among the authors the Metropolitan Library Service Agency (MELSA) will feature in its new Club Book season. Not just in one location, but in eight libraries across the Twin Cities metro. So whether you live in St. Paul or Minneapolis, Chanhassen or Woodbury, you’ll have the chance to see a big-name author nearby– for free. And if you can’t attend in person, you can listen later to the podcast.

Mann , whose “The Wizard and the Prophet” tells of two influential yet little-known scientists who laid the groundwork for the environmentalist movement.
Club Book is coordinated by Library Strategies, the nonprofit consulting group of the Friends of the Saint Paul Public Library, and supported in part by Legacy funds. FMI.
Minnesota Opera to buy The Lab
Minnesota Opera announced Wednesday afternoon that it will buy the Lab Theater, the 350-person performance space located right next door to the Minnesota Opera Center on North 1st St. in Minneapolis’ North Loop. The purchase will add another 6,000 square feet – and a 350-person theater – to its Minneapolis campus, currently 50,000 square feet.
Don’t panic, Lab lovers. The opera has said that the current managers and tenants will continue their work and performances without interruption through at least May 2020. “We believe it is important that we maintain this space as an artistic home for local companies in the Twin Cities,” Minnesota Opera President and General Director Ryan Taylor said in a statement. “We are still formulating plans at this time, but we do anticipate a need in the future to renovate the space and we want to make sure that we fully understand community needs as a part of that process.”
Carved out of the foundation of a historic Itasca warehouse along the Mississippi River, the big stone box was the Guthrie’s second stage from 1988-2006. Since then, Executive Producer Mary Kelley Leer has hosted emerging and established performing artists in theater, music, dance, cabaret, fashion and burlesque. Companies including Theater Latté Da, the Moving Company and Minnesota Dance Theatre have staged shows in the Lab.
So has the Minnesota Opera, whose “Memory Boy” was there in 2016 and whose fully-staged Project Opera productions “Brundibar” and “The Gondoliers” will take place there Friday and Saturday (Feb. 8 and 9). Project Opera is Minnesota Opera’s youth training program for talented young singers. FMI, times and tickets ($5-15).
The picks
Tonight (Thursday, Feb. 7) at Metropolitan State University, St. Paul campus: “In the Company of Others” gallery talk by photographer Den-Zell Gilliard . A young street photographer and south Minneapolis resident, Gilliard has been mentored by Wing Young Huie and Inna Valin and strongly influenced by Gordon Parks. This exhibition features selections from three of his series: “Sunday’s Best,” “Odyssey of a Black Boy” and self-portraits. Reception from 6-8 p.m., artist talk at 7:30. In the Gordon Parks Gallery on the third floor of the Library and Learning Center, 645 East Seventh St., St. Paul. FMI. Free.
Friday at the Parkway: Ben Wendel Seasons Band. First, the remarkable band: multi-reedist and Kneebody co-founder Ben Wendel, pianist Aaron Parks, guitarist Gilad Hekselman, bassist Matt Brewer, drummer Eric Harland. All leading, in-demand, accomplished jazz artists. Second, the project. Inspired by Tchaikovsky, Wendel wrote a suite of 12 original compositions, then recorded one per month with 12 different duet partners and released them as a series of widely praised YouTube videos. Hundreds of thousands of views later, he’s out with an album and the above-named band. It’s all so imaginative, and the music is so interesting, and the band is so great. Here they are playing “February.” 8 p.m. at the tastefully renovated Parkway. FMI and tickets ($15 advance, $20 door).
Friday at Orchestra Hall: Walker, Osowski, Cox and Washington. Last October, award-winning mezzo-soprano Clara Osowski released her debut album, “Haunted Blue.” A series of original compositions by jazz pianist Jeremy Walker, with lyrics by poet Greg Foley, featuring bassist Anthony Cox, it’s an exquisite set of jazz-tinged, 21st-century art songs – an exciting new direction for the artists and for us as listeners. On Friday, Walker, Osowski and Cox will perform in the jewel-box atrium at Orchestra Hall.

Texto completo: Of all the millions of people who have spit into a plastic vial and sent their DNA off to have it analyzed, writer Dani Shapiro might be the most prepared for what happened next.
The core of Shapiro’s work — this bestselling author has written 10 books — has always concerned family issues, those tangled emotional webs we weave around each other and the secrets we keep.
“It has been a huge part of what formed me as a writer — I had an obsession with searching and digging, trying to understand,” Shapiro says, noting that half of her books are memoirs about deep, personal exploration. “I idly wondered why (I kept writing memoirs) but those were the books that continued to present themselves to me as necessary. And that comes very much out of not knowing something and writing in order to try to know.”
Part of what she didn’t know was why, with her fair hair and blue eyes, she barely resembled her parents, both Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe — an otherness remarked upon by people throughout her life.
All is revealed when the results of an Ancestry.com test that she took “on a whim” come back: She is not her beloved father’s biological daughter after all, but the product of artificial insemination her parents turned to when they could not conceive. Why that happened and what meaning Shapiro makes of it is the subject of her riveting new memoir, “Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love.”
“This discovery poured gasoline over everything I thought I knew and threw a match on it,” she says. “Now I see the whole picture.”
Since its release in January, the book has quickly risen to the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction and has already been optioned by Hollywood, a clear indication that both her writing and the topic of family secrets is speaking to the hearts of millions.
“I certainly wanted it to resonate with people who had been through similar experiences or discovered there were family secrets —everybody seems to have them,” said Shapiro in a phone interview while she was on the road for her national book tour that lands in Southern California for several appearances this week.
“Adoptees, people who discover they were donor conceived, or have half siblings — there are so many of those kinds of secrets tumbling out of the closet right now,” she observes.
More like an avalanche.
She notes that in 2018 alone 7 million Ancestry.com kits were purchased — and that doesn’t take into account what might be sold for other commercial DNA services like 23andMe. (DNA kits were the No. 1 holiday gift last year, too.) Shapiro discovered while researching “Inheritance” that out of the 7 million kits, 14 percent revealed what’s known in that industry as ”NPE,” Not Parent Expected: “That’s a huge number of people. Many of them, like me, were just recreational DNA testing.”
The ease and accessibility of these DNA tests herald a historical shift, she believes. “I think this is a moment in our culture when secrets and the impossibility of secrets is reaching a deafening roar,” Shapiro observes. “Paternity, ethnicity — these were secrets people could keep since the beginning of time, and did. And now that is over. I think in a few decades the idea that there ever were these secrets is going to seem like the most ridiculous thing you’d ever heard.”
Yet the exploration she undertakes in this book is even more universal: At the center is the question: How do heredity and history combine to make us who we are?
Says Shapiro: “I was also very aware that I did not only want people that could directly relate to the material to be readers of this book, because I felt I had learned so much in this really sort of harsh and complicated, and ultimately liberating, journey. I learned so much about identity, and family, and what makes a father a father, and about nature and nurture.”
Anyone who knows Shapiro’s work understands that she was close to her father, who died in an accident when she was 23, and distant from her abusive mother. These are themes that have run throughout her work. Reconciling her experience with her biological makeup was the “emotionally challenging” part of her journey to write this book.
“One of the things I had to contend with was the deep suspicion that I was part of my father’s sadness. The man that I tried so hard to make happy. But I don’t think that diminished in any way the love he had for me,” she says. “The irony is my biological parent is the one I felt a deep disconnection from, while my father, who was not my biological parent, was the one to whom I was connected. I think that my mother looked at me for all of our shared life together and found it very challenging because I was her secret. I was a reminder of their infertility; I was not my father’s child and on some very deep animal level, she knew it.”
There’s a moment in “Inheritance” where a friend tells her, “Everyone feels other,” and that she had been the explorer to come back to teach us all something about what that means. “I very much took that to heart,” she says.

Carolyn Kirk named executive director of Mass. Technology Collaborative
Carolyn Kirk has been named the new executive director of the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative. Kirk, a deputy secretary of housing and economic development in the Baker administration, had stepped in last June to run the quasi-public tech collaborative on an interim basis after Tim Connelly's departure. Before joining the Baker administration, she was a four-term mayor of Gloucester, following a career in technology at companies such as IBM and Fleet Financial. Kirk will oversee 55-plus employees across MassTech's three divisions. Kirk will earn a $230,000 annual salary in her new role, compared to nearly $147,000 as deputy secretary. — JON CHESTO

Maine proposal would change rules for lobster fishermen training
A proposal in Maine would allow new lobster fishermen to complete their apprenticeships by demonstrating proficiency as opposed to by logging hours. The proposal from Representative Billy Bob Faulkingham, a Winter Harbor Republican, would allow an apprentice to complete the program by bringing at least 4,000 pounds of lobster to the shore over a period of not less than two years. Faulkingham is a lobsterman himself, and says he believes a productivity-based system would be a more accurate gauge of proficiency than a system based on logging time. The apprenticeships are necessary to eventually obtain a commercial fishing license for lobster. The proposal is set for a public hearing before the marine ­resources committee, on which Faulkingham sits, on Feb. 12. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
RIDE HAILING
Taxi drivers in Madrid abandon strike
Taxi drivers in Madrid have ended a 16-day strike after failing to force authorities in the Spanish capital to impose tighter restrictions on ride-hailing companies like Uber and ­Cabify. Fifty-three percent of over 7,000 taxi drivers who voted Tuesday backed calling off the strike, according to the professional association of taxi drivers Elite Taxi. The taxi sector had wanted Madrid's regional government to take similar action to authorities in Spain's second-largest city, Barcelona, where a taxi strike resulted in new regulations requiring users of ride-hailing apps to contract services 15 minutes beforehand. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Volvo recalling more than 160,000 cars because of faulty latch on electric trunks
Swedish automaker Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely holding company, says it is recalling 167,000 cars worldwide because the hatch lid lift system on electric trunks can loosen, stop working in cold weather, and possibly cause damage. Group spokeswoman Annika Bjerstaf says the recall is "a preventive safety measure," adding Volvo Cars "has not received any reports of serious incidents surrounding this." Bjerstaf said Wednesday the recall covers the Volvo XC 60 built in 2018 and 2019. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Lyft passengers will be able to request electric or hybrid vehicles
Lyft passengers will soon be able to request a ride in an electric or hybrid vehicle when they're planning a trip. The ride-hailing company is launching the feature first in Seattle and then in other cities. The option will show up when passengers are choosing between available Lyft vehicles and it will not cost more for riders than traveling in a car with an internal combustion engine. Lyft is also rolling out electric vehicles in Seattle and Atlanta in the fleet of cars that it rents to Lyft drivers who don't own their own vehicles. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

New York Times wants 10 million subscribers by 2025
The New York Times Co. generated more than $709 million in digital revenue last year, growing at a pace that suggests it will meet its stated goal of $800 million in digital sales by the end of 2020. The results prompted the company to set another lofty target: to grow its subscription business to more than 10 million subscriptions by 2025, Mark Thompson, the chief executive, said in a statement announcing the company's fourth-quarter financial results. More than 3.3 million people pay for the company's digital products, including its news, crossword, and food apps, a 27 percent jump from 2017. The total number of paid subscriptions for digital and print reached 4.3 million, a high. The company added 265,000 digital subscribers in the fourth quarter, the biggest jump since the so-called Trump bump after the 2016 election. Its stock rose 10.3 percent Wednesday. — NEW YORK TIMES

Toyota's profit drops dramatically
Toyota's fiscal third-quarter profit plunged to $12.6 billion, about a fifth of what the Japanese automaker earned a year earlier, despite relatively solid sales, the Japanese automaker said Wednesday. Toyota Motor Corp.'s October-December profit in 2017 had totaled 941.8 billion yen, helped by US tax cuts. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

CFPB to loosen rules governing payday lenders
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday proposed drastically weakening Obama-era rules governing payday lenders, boosting the fortunes of an industry accused of keeping low-income borrowers trapped in a cycle of debt. Under the existing rule, which is set to go into effect in August, payday lenders are required to verify borrowers can afford the loans they are being offered. The proposal would rescind that requirement and delay the rule's implementation until 2020. The proposal is a significant win for payday lenders. The industry worried the original rule would force most payday lenders to close their doors and sued to block its enforcement. Short-term, high-interest loans should be regulated but the Obama-era rules are too cumbersome and costly, they say. — WASHINGTON POST

Fisher-Price recalling Power Wheels Barbie Campers
Fisher-Price is voluntarily recalling about 44,000 Children's Power Wheels Barbie Dream Campers because they can keep running after the foot pedal is released. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says Fisher-Price has received 17 complaints. No injuries have been reported. The model FRC29 battery-operated vehicles are hot pink with blue accents and have the Barbie logo printed on the back. They include a play kitchen, a fold-out grill, and pretend campfire. They were sold exclusively by Walmart for about $400 from July 2018 through January. Customers should take the model away from children and contact Fisher-Price for a free repair. Fisher-Price can be reached at 800-348-0751 or at www.fisher-price.com. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

J. C. Penney to stop selling major appliances
J.C. Penney will no longer be selling major appliances, ending its three-year run. The Plano, Texas-based department store chain also says that furniture will only be available on its website and in Puerto Rico stores. The move marks the first major initiative by the company's new CEO Jill Soltau to try to turn around J.C. Penney's business. Sales of appliances will be discontinued as of Feb. 28. The company says it wants to go back to focusing on fashion and home furnishings, which carry higher profit margins. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Service to buy two podcast companies
The music streaming service Spotify is buying the podcast companies Gimlet and Anchor as it looks to take on Apple's popular iTunes' podcasting platform. Gimlet Media has a podcast studio with dedicated IP development, production, and advertising capabilities. Anchor has a platform of tools for podcast creators, as well as an established and rapidly growing creator base. Spotify's founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek, said in a blog post Wednesday that Spotify has become the second-biggest podcasting platform in a little less than two years. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., didn’t appear to care all that much for President Trump’s State of the Union address Tuesday evening.

In fact, at one point in the speech, when the president said that “we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good,” Pelosi appeared to respond with applause that can most charitably be described as sarcastic. It was an interesting moment, and it was certainly entertaining so far as the drama of U.S. politics is concerned.

But the response to the sarcastic clap from certain newsrooms and reporters has been, shall we say, a bit overenthusiastic.

“How Nancy Pelosi's 'f*** you' clapping stole Trump’s thunder,” read a headline published by the U.K.’s Independent.

The Week’s Speed Reads shares that “Nancy Pelosi's enigmatic golf clap at Trump was at least as memorable as Trump's State of the Union speech.”

“Nancy Pelosi literally 'claps back' at Trump's State of the Union,” gushed one Mashable headline, using slang that the 78-year-old has surely never heard of.

“The clap that says ‘one of us is a prison bitch. And the other is Nancy Fucking Pelosi,’” beamed Huffington Post blogger Bryan Behar. An odd moment to make light of prison rape, but ... well, whatever.

Slate’s Christina Cauterucci said, in reference to a children’s song, “Nancy Pelosi distracts out-of-control toddler with rendition of ‘Baby Shark.’”

New York Times contributor Melissa Blake said elsewhere, “Clear the way!! My 2019 mood has officially arrived!! Nancy Pelosi is my spirit animal.”

“When bless your heart means everything but bless your heart. The Pelosi clap is 2019 energy,” said the Boston Globe’s Jeneé Osterheldt.

BBC Three deputy editor Declan Cashin tweeted: Even NBC News’ relatively staid Kasie Hunt referred to the photo as “iconic” and “everything,” whatever that means. For further context, here’s how infamous #resistance grifter Scott Dworkin reacted to the Pelosi clap: If you’re in the news media covering politics, and your reaction to a political moment is totally indistinguishable from the reaction of a known grifter and partisan activist, maybe it’s time to step back and re-evaluate how you look at and tweet about politics.

Weekly Run newsletter: Jae Crowder, who knows all about trade deadline pressure, says his advice is, ‘You owe it to your teammates just to stay focused’

Texto completo: The Weekly Run is a Salt Lake Tribune newsletter on the Utah Jazz. Subscribe here .
Jae Crowder knows what it’s like to be traded. After all, he’s been dealt from Dallas to Boston. And from Boston to Cleveland. And from Cleveland to Utah.
So he’s a decent source for knowing what players might be thinking or going through as the NBA’s trade deadline approaches. (The deadline is Thursday at 1 p.m. MT.)
The Jazz are reportedly being aggressive in pursuing potential deals, which can be a distraction for those whose names show up in the rumored trades. Crowder’s advice? It’s ultimately not up to you whether you get traded or not, so stay away from social media as much as possible and keep your focus on doing your job.
“At the end of the day, we have no control over it. We have no control over it, and you’re just gonna stress yourself out by looking at it, reading into it, stuff like that,” he said. “So just focus on your teammates, focus on the task at hand, which is Phoenix [on Wednesday]. That’s the advice I can give somebody.”
Of course, he recognizes that’s easier for some than others. He also acknowledged that no two situations are the same. These days, he said, it’s pretty easy for him to “block out a lot of stuff.” Earlier in his career, that wasn’t the case.
He recalled being unhappy with his playing time in Dallas and actively seeking and hoping for a trade away from the Mavericks. Veteran forward and former star Vince Carter had to remind a young Crowder that he needed to keep working hard in the interim.
“He told me, ‘You still have to come in and do your work.’ I was basically not even wanting to come to practice, knowing I might be traded at the deadline. But I continued to be a professional. It’s all about being professional — we have a job here, [and] you owe that to your teammates,” Crowder said. “It took me a while to understand it, but then I’ve been through it a few times, and now I fully understand the whole process of it all. But you owe it to your teammates just to stay focused as much as possible and give it your all when you’re on the court.”
Our stories of the past week
• We’re a day away from the NBA trade deadline. Which means you want to be up to date on the latest Jazz possibilities — Mike Conley? Otto Porter? Nikola Mirotic? Andy Larsen and I discuss it all on the latest “Weekly Run” podcast. [TRIB]
• Raul Neto is probable to play tonight vs. the Suns. But Dante Exum and Thabo Sefolosha are still out. The Jazz have been short-handed now for a month, and while everyone has adopted a “next man up” mentality, the inevitable consequence is that the bench production has, unsurprisingly, taken a hit. [TRIB]
• Some eyebrows were raised when the Jazz drafted controversial Duke product Grayson Allen last summer. While the rookie’s production has been limited, he and his teammates insist they’re seeing progress. [TRIB]
• There are some reports that the two primary offers for Grizzlies point guard Mike Conley have come from the Jazz and the Pistons. Andy breaks down the market. [TRIB]
• Donovan Mitchell has one of the highest usage rates in the NBA this season, and one of the highest in league history among rookies or sophomores. So how is the Jazz star handling the load? [TRIB]
• It seems a long time ago now, with so much attention on the trade deadline, but Rudy Gobert getting snubbed for the All-Star Game was a big deal. Big enough that the reigning Defensive Player of the Year was quite upset about it. [TRIB]
• Trib columnist Gordon Monson was also annoyed by Gobert’s All-Star snub, and he had some words for the Western Conference coaches who left the big man off the team. [TRIB]

Quote of the Week
Hard to go with anything other than Rudy speaking about his All-Star snub. Before he broke down, he had some incendiary words for what he perceived as the hypocritical actions of the coaches who didn’t vote for him:
Rudy: "I think it’s disrespectful. … All the coaches preach about defense, every day they talk about defense, about what an honor it is to get stops, to win basketball games; and when it’s time to vote, they they’re not able to reward the best defensive player in the game." pic.twitter.com/MJctRhRuLu

“I feel disrespected. It’s disrespectful not only towards me, but towards the team, towards the organization, and towards the game. All the coaches preach about defense, every day they talk about defense, about what an honor it is to get stops, to win basketball games; and when it’s time to vote, they they’re not able to reward the best defensive player in the game.”
Up next
The Jazz have three games left until the All-Star break. Tonight comes the first of four matchups with Phoenix this season. The Spurs will be here on Saturday for a rare afternoon game (tipoff is set for 3 p.m.). And then, next Tuesday, the Jazz will visit the Warriors in Oakland.

Online’s ‘walled gardens’ must stop assuming real news is free

Texto completo: Facebook and Google have been brutal to the news business. But this primarily reflects a failure of imagination. The tech giants are the world’s best distribution platforms and could be an answer for journalism instead of a grave threat.
As readers have shifted to digital sources, the two companies have taken a large majority of online advertising revenue. More important, the platforms now act as "regulators" of the news business — determining what information gets delivered to whom, and when. With the flick of an algorithmic finger, those two companies decide what news you see and whether a publisher lives or dies.
The impact on journalism has been clear. Just within the past week, we have seen over 1,000 planned layoffs at Gannett, BuzzFeed and HuffPost, and no one thinks we are anywhere near the end. Facebook and Google’s answer so far has been to pledge to spend $300 million each over the next three years to help journalism. But that money will be dribbled across a huge news landscape, and much of it will undoubtedly be used to encourage further use of Facebook and Google products.
But such investments amount to charity, and charity will never be the answer. What news publishers really need are active partners who are willing to embrace the idea that quality journalism sustains our civic society and that the answer to bad information is more good information.
We can start with the fact that "free" isn’t a good business model for quality journalism. Facebook and Google flatly refuse to pay for news even though they license many other types of content. Both companies have deals to pay music publishers when copyrighted songs play on their platforms. And the companies also aggressively bid to stream live sports and entertainment content to run on Facebook Watch and YouTube. These deals are varied and often secret, but none of them are based on "free." Why are the platforms so unwilling to pay news publishers for access to the quality journalism that users need and value?
The tech giants are also run as "walled gardens" that minimize brands and separate publishers from their readers — even while hoarding information about those same readers. Imagine trying to build a trusted relationship with an audience when you can’t even know who they are. Publishers need new economic terms that include more revenue and more information about our readers. Any minor costs to these companies would pay huge dividends not only for our society but also for their credibility with Congress and policymakers around the world.
Facebook and Google also need to be willing to acknowledge investments in quality journalism through their algorithms. They are constantly on the defensive about spreading false and misleading "news" that hurts people. They could start to address the problem by simply recognizing that The Miami Herald is a much better news source than Russian bots or Macedonian teenagers — and highlighting original, quality content accordingly.
A study by the University of North Carolina’s School of Media and Journalism found that more than 1,300 American communities have completely lost sources of local news.
David Simon, a former newspaper journalist who became a TV writer, lamented the loss of local coverage and said in an interview with The Guardian: "Oh, to be a state or local official in America over the next 10 to 15 years, before somebody figures out the business model. To gambol freely across the wastelands of an American city, as a local politician! It’s got to be one of the great dreams in the history of American corruption."
Facebook and Google could address these risks by embracing responsibilities and becoming partners, rather than minor benefactors, for journalism. They need to come to the table with a real deal on revenue, data and algorithms.
Facebook and Google talk incessantly about how they are improving the world. Why not do something genuinely good for all of us and support journalism instead of destroying it? And it wouldn’t even have to be that hard. There is plenty of money and quality content to go around. All it would take is a little enlightened self-interest and a real commitment to the continued existence of quality news.
David Chavern is president and CEO of the News Media Alliance, a trade association representing news publishers in the United States and Canada. This is an edited version of a column that first appeared in The New York Times.

Don’t make ‘Medicare for all’ a litmus test

Texto completo: Hear that crunching sound? It’s the eggshells that 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are stomping through, backing up and stomping upon all over again, as they attempt to satisfy the base’s delicate demands for Medicare-for-all.
The left-wing die-hards sometimes argue that supporting Medicare-for-all should be a litmus test for anyone seeking the 2020 nomination because it’s not only good policy but good politics, too. The entrenched establishment may claim it’s a "radical" idea, but surveys suggest it is mainstream.
"If I look at polling and 70 percent of the people support Medicare for All, if a very significant percentage of people think the rich, the very rich, should start paying their fair share of taxes," Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, told The New York Times, "I think I’d be pretty dumb not to develop policies that capture what the American people want."
In a sense, Sanders is right: The phrase "Medicare-for-all" polls favorably (though not always at 70 percent), and has for several years.
Here’s the problem. The things Americans are apparently envisioning when they tell pollsters they support Medicare-for-all turn out to be a different, vaguer and more varied set of ideas than the specific thing that Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, and others in the progressive base are proposing. Sanders, et al. want all Americans enrolled in a single, generous, government-run — or single-payer — plan with no private insurers offering their own similar, competing policies.
How does the public feel about this? If you simply ask, "Do you favor or oppose having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all?," 56 percent of respondents favor it, according to a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll. But mention that Medicare-for-all involves getting rid of private insurance companies, and support plummets to 37 percent.
Wary of provoking the single-payer-or-bust-ers, some Democratic 2020 candidates have given incoherent or noncommittal remarks on the subject. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachussetts, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York have both sidestepped the issue. Asked about private insurance, Warren said last week there were a lot of paths to get to "affordable health care for every American."
And you know what? That’s the right answer right now. The thing Americans want most, if you look at the polling, is not single-payer per se. They want universal, affordable coverage that doesn’t leave them begging on GoFundMe for their kids’ insulin. In that same Kaiser survey, support for "Medicare for All" was highest — 71 percent — when respondents were told it would "guarantee health insurance as a right for all Americans." And purity tests aside, there are many ways to achieve that outcome. Rather than insisting that "there’s no viable path to the Democratic nomination for someone who does not support single-payer health care," as one progressive writer put it, Democrats should start with principles and objectives, and figure out the most effective and feasible route to them.
This is the richest country on Earth. Truly, we can figure this out. But not if we let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

Opposing war doesn't equal Putin's stooge

Texto completo: PARIS - Apparently it's now necessary for American political candidates to advocate endless interventionist wars, lest they end up accused of being a useful idiot for the Kremlin.
The fact that Russian leadership happens to share a position on something doesn't mean that the position is invalid. If we learn tomorrow that Vladimir Putin likes Diet Coke, some people will see it as proof that Donald Trump is a Kremlin puppet. It is indeed possible for two different leaders to show a preference for the same thing - such as not being bogged down in fruitless wars - but for different reasons.
And now it has come to this: A war veteran announcing her candidacy for president of the United States has been attacked by NBC News because she has a point of view that also happens to be held by the Russian president.
Tulsi Gabbard, 37, a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, spent a year serving with a Hawaii National Guard field medical unit in a combat zone in Iraq - a mission for which she volunteered. After graduating with honors from the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy, Gabbard deployed again to Kuwait as a military police officer, and she continues to serve as a major in the National Guard.
On Saturday, Gabbard officially declared her candidacy for president. At her campaign kickoff event, she talked about ending the exploitation of American troops by politicians bent on regime change.
"We must stand up ... against powerful politicians from both parties who sit in ivory towers thinking up new wars to wage, new places for people to die," Gabbard said. "These powerful politicians dishonor the sacrifices made by every one of my brothers and sisters in uniform, their families - they are the ones who pay the price for these wars."
On Friday, NBC News had posted a story about how experts who track Russian websites and social media accounts linked to the Kremlin are seeing "the first stirrings of an upcoming Russian campaign of support for Gabbard."
NBC News analyst Alex Stamos is quoted in the story, saying that Gabbard's "promulgation of positions compatible with Russian geo strategic interests can help them mainstream such discussion in the (Democratic) party."
Gabbard lashed out at the NBC story Sunday, citing a report by noted journalist Glen Greenwald that the only source NBC used was a firm that just got caught by The New York Times fabricating Russian troll accounts for the Democratic Party in the Alabama Senate race.
To reduce Gabbard to some kind of Russian stooge, as NBC did, would mean buying into the idea that it's implausible for someone who has seen war close up to want to avoid it if other alternatives exist.
"Gabbard's most controversial position and the one where she's most in line with Russian interests is on Syria," wrote NBC News reporters Robert Windrem and Ben Popken. "She's accused the U.S. of pushing a policy of 'regime change' wars and in January 2017, she met with Syrian President Bashar (Assad) in Syria on what she called a 'fact-finding mission.' "
Gabbard strikes a chord that transcends the ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans - at least for those who aren't beholden to special interests. Politicians from both parties unite on little except for the call to intervene militarily in foreign countries. They might cite different reasons - the left prefers "humanitarian intervention" while the right peddles fear (usually of terrorism) - but the addiction to foreign meddling is a shared one.
With her military background, Gabbard understands that American troops have been abused and misused to serve the agendas of soft-handed establishment politicians for whom the realities of war are little more than an abstraction. It's an insult to independent-minded Americans to suggest that anyone who aligns with her thinking is nothing more than a pawn of Putin.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- For public consumption, President Trump planned to use his State of the Union address on Tuesday night to appeal for bipartisan unity. But at a private lunch for television anchors earlier in the day, he offered searing assessments of a host of Democrats.
Mr. Trump dismissed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as "dumb," called Senator Chuck Schumer of New York a "nasty son of a bitch" and mocked Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, who he said "choked like a dog" at a news conference where he tried to explain a racist yearbook photo, according to multiple people in the room.
The White House declined to comment on the president's remarks.
Energized and blunt, Mr. Trump held little back during the lunch at the White House to preview the State of the Union address. As he has in past years, he offered an unvarnished, unscripted view of the political world that went well beyond the heavily vetted speech he delivered to a joint session of Congress and a national television audience.
[Follow our live briefing for updates and analysis of the address.]
He seemed confident about his chances for re-election next year, breaking down the emerging field of possible opponents with scathing assessments and predicting that Democrats would move so far to the left that it would make it easier for him to win a second term.
He said he hoped he would get to run against Mr. Biden. "I hope it's Biden," Mr. Trump said. "Biden was never very smart. He was a terrible student. His gaffes are unbelievable. When I say something that you might think is a gaffe, it's on purpose; it's not a gaffe. When Biden says something dumb, it's because he's dumb."
He also expressed a desire to take on Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom he regularly derides with the racially inflammatory nickname of Pocahontas because she has claimed a distant Native American heritage.
"I hope I haven't wounded Pocahontas too badly," he said. "I'd like to run against her."
Mr. Trump said that Senator Kamala Harris of California has had the best campaign kickoff of any of the Democrats so far, a comment he also made last week in an interview with The New York Times.
But he dismissed Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, who is exploring a possible independent candidacy. "He doesn't have a shot," Mr. Trump said. "Not a shot."
As for the Democratic congressional leaders who have vexed him so much lately, he had kinder words for Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California than for Mr. Schumer. Ms. Pelosi, he said, is nice to him in private but then says terrible things about him on camera. "Schumer," he added, "can be a nasty son of a bitch."
He also dismissed Mr. Northam, the Virginia governor who is fending off calls to resign from Democrats and Republicans alike after the discovery of his 1984 medical school yearbook page that included a photograph of a man in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe.
Mr. Northam initially confirmed he was one of the two men and then reversed himself on Saturday at a news conference where he said he was not actually in the picture, although he had, on another occasion, worn blackface to impersonate Michael Jackson at a dance contest where he performed the singer's famed moonwalk.
Mr. Trump's draft speech included a passage lashing out at Mr. Northam for comments the governor made recently about late-term abortions. But at the lunch, the president also focused on the racial controversy, ridiculing his moonwalking comment.
"Did you see that news conference?" Mr. Trump asked. "Could you believe it? He choked like a dog."
Not every target was a Democrat. He recounted again the story of what he considered Senator John McCain's betrayal in voting against advancing a measure to repeal President Barack Obama's health care program. Although Mr. McCain has since died, Mr. Trump remains upset.
"By the way," Mr. Trump said, "he wrote a book and the book bombed."

Texto completo: Opportunities to see high-caliber productions of the work of Dario Fo -- the Italian clown, political radical and Nobel laureate who died in 2016 -- don't come around all that often.
My one golden memory is of an off-off-Broadway production decades ago of "We Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!" But the subversive zaniness that was Fo's specialty and remains his legacy has been something I've largely had to take on account.
The Actors' Gang production of "Accidental Death of an Anarchist" at the company's Ivy Substation headquarters in Culver City fills us in on what many of us have been missing. But this attractive, hard-working production also suggests why there might be some reluctance to try out Fo's plays.

Problems of translation and differences in cultural tastes are compounded by an even bigger issue: Nothing ages faster than styles of comedy.
The political targets of "Accidental Death of an Anarchist" are still sadly with us, requiring only a brisk American reworking of names and places to make the play sting again. But the systematic plot seems sluggish and at odds with the manic improvisational verve that was perhaps Fo's true genius.
The play belabors what the performers need to generate with volcanic spontaneity. As a result, the game cast, under the direction of Will Thomas McFadden, charms and exhausts in equal measure.
"Anarchist" is the only play by Fo to make it to Broadway, where it was quickly sent packing by the New York Times' all-powerful Frank Rich in 1984. "This is an evening of strained silliness that defies even the Herculean, high-flying efforts of its star, the gifted English actor Jonathan Pryce, to galvanize it," Rich wrote in what would turn out to be the short-lived production's coroner's report.
An indefatigable Bob Turton plays the central role of the Maniac, who busts into a police station where a railway worker suspected of terrorism recently leaped from a window after a protracted and unprincipled interrogation. Posing (in this heavily tweaked version of Jon Laskin and Michael Aquilante's translation) as a special counsel sent from the Justice Department, this protean nut job investigates the matter himself, exposing the brutality and cover-up of a police department that is as fiendishly corrupt as the Maniac is farcically lawless.
To succeed in this relentlessly madcap role (sometimes translated as the Madman or Fool), an actor must succumb to the lunacy. As the Maniac's disguises get more outlandish, his behavior grows more unhinged. But insanity, even with goofy prosthetics, isn't easily faked, and this demented folly can only work if it flows naturally.
Robin Williams would have been perfect for the role in his prime, and Jim Carrey might want to consider testing it out in a compressed adaptation. But the play requires a performer who can't contain his clowning.
Turton is fearlessly wacky, but he is an actor before he's a jester, and so the performance can't help seeming a little studied at times. It's strange to feel guilty for not being more amused, but I found myself applauding Turton's boldness, cheering his stamina, saluting his virtuosity -- and laughing only sparingly.
The production, perhaps inspired by an exhibition of art by Fo and renowned illustrator Ralph Steadman that Actors' Gang artistic director Tim Robbins has set up in the lobby, has great visual style. Margaret Cleary's sets, Cihan Sahin's projections, Bosco Flanagan's lighting and Tess Vidal's costumes establish a world that is at once redolent of 1970 (when the play was first done) and theatrically eternal.
Ethan Corn and Adam J. Jefferis, both wiry and mustachioed, are fun to watch as hyper-aggressive police captains at each other's throats. Lynde Houck's swaggering police chief yields some genuine chuckles as the pressure on her slippery character mounts. Tom Szymanski stomps about intimidatingly as a beefy officer. And Julia Finch adds a welcome dose of rational competence as the journalist who sees straight through the crooked bureaucratic shenanigans when she makes a late entrance in the second act
"Accidental Death of an Anarchist" takes too much time to get into top gear, but when it explodes into full-blown madness (complete with blaring music) it's a raucous delight. The political punchlines have been expertly renovated to agitate all sides. (Fo himself was a master of offending politicians of every stripe.) Donald Trump isn't a main topic of mockery in this update, but he lurks conspicuously in the background of jokes. Direct hits, though, aren't necessary: The basic outline of Fo's satire is so twisted it already gives the president's Twitter account a run for its deranged money.
The uncompromising ending (endings, to be accurate -- the play gives the audience a choice) might help explain how this comedian-turned-dramatist ended up with the Nobel Prize in literature. Fo was no Beckett or Pinter, but his penetrating political comedy has some lasting insights into state power and the treacherous deceptions institutionalized to maintain it. The Actors' Gang deserves our gratitude for bravely tackling a play that, despite some arthritis in its joints, hasn't lost its punch.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The daughter of late Sen. John McCain denounced President Donald Trump as "pathetic" on Tuesday after reports surfaced that the president mocked the late senator just hours before his State of the Union address.
Trump reportedly made fun of McCain, a Republican who died in August after battling brain cancer, during an off-the-record lunch with television news anchors.
During the meeting, Trump attacked Democrats and recited the moment when McCain voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act, according to The New York Times.
"By the way, he wrote a book and the book bombed," Trump said of McCain's book, "The Restless Wave," according to the Times.
McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, called out Trump on Twitter, calling his comments "pathetic. "
More: Donald Trump's apparent response to Meghan McCain's eulogy for her dad is a MAGA tweet
Opinion: White House flag flies high as Donald Trump disses John McCain
"The president’s obsession with my father 6 months after his death is pathetic and telling – even at a time when he should be focusing on his message to the American public and the state of our union – the greatness of my father’s life and legacy haunts you," she wrote on Twitter.
McCain's book soared on the bestseller's list after his death. It was ranked No. 2 on Amazon and No. 3 on Barnes and Noble's website, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The book chronicles his battle with brain cancer and reflects on his time in the military and serving in Congress. McCain was often critical of the president and in the book wrote: "He seems uninterested in the moral character of world leaders and their regimes. The appearance of toughness or a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more than any of our values. Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity. "
Trump did not attend McCain's funeral in Washington. During the proceedings, he posted on Twitter.
"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" Trump wrote in one tweet.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Beyond the president's words, and watching to see what lines do or don't draw standing ovations, the State of the Union guest list is always one of the most watched aspects of the president's annual address.
That has certainly been true since 1982, when President Ronald Reagan started the tradition of acknowledging presidential guests in the gallery by honoring the heroism of Lenny Skutnik, who had pulled a plane crash victim from the icy Potomac River. Since then, presidents have invited "Lenny Skutniks" to underscore parts of the address or highlight the administration's achievements.
Members of Congress also each get to invite one guest (congressional leadership gets more) and they often bestow their tickets to make a political point against or in support of the president.
Here's look at some of lawmakers' invited guests to the 2019 address.
State of the Union: Politically wounded from the shutdown, Trump faces a tough time with his agenda
5 things to watch in the president's SOTU address
More: When, where and how to watch this year
Workers hit by the shutdown
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , has invited Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, an air traffic control specialist who lost her home in a 2017 wildfire and was furloughed during the 35-day government shutdown. Pesiri-Dybvik's husband is an air-traffic controller who had to work without pay through the shutdown.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. , will bring Lila Johnson, who has worked as a custodian for more than 20 years at the Department of Agriculture. As a contract employee, Johnson will not be paid for the work hours she lost in the shutdown.
Other lawmakers also plan to invite people impacted by the shutdown including Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. ; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R. I. ; Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D. C. ; and freshman Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Va.
Trump has said he is willing to shut down the government down again if lawmakers do not approve the money he has requested for the construction of a wall on the U. S. -Mexico border.
Border Patrol representatives
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has invited Manny Padilla, who runs a Customs and Border Protection task force, The Dallas Morning News reported, and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, will bring Brandon Judd, the head of the Border Patrol union. Judd encouraged Trump to stay firm during the shutdown in his demand for a border wall.
Shooting survivors
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , plans to bring Cameron Kasky, a student activist and survivor of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, that left 17 dead in Parkland, Florida.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. , will bring Andy Pollack, the father of Parkland victim Meadow Pollack.
Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, D-Texas, invited Rhonda Hart, whose daughter was among 10 people killed in a May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas.
Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn. , invited Lane Murdock, a high school student who helped organize the National School Walkout after the Parkland shooting.

The woman who cornered Sen. Jeff Flake in an elevator
Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , is bringing Ana Maria Archila, the woman who berated then-Sen. Jeff Flake as the Arizona Republican tried to take an elevator to cast a vote as part of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation.
"I never thought I’d be excited about being in the same room with Donald Trump," said Archila, who is the co-executive director of the left-leaning Center for Popular Democracy.
A soldier's widow
Jennie Taylor, the widow of a Utah mayor killed while serving in Afghanistan, will attend as the guest of Utah Republican Rep. Bob Bishop.
Undocumented ex-Trump golf club employees
Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif. , announced he will bring Sandra Diaz, a native of Costa Rica who worked at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. Diaz is now a legal U. S. resident, but she was undocumented when she worked at the club between 2010 and 2013.
Victorina Morales, a Guatemalan who also worked at Trump’s Bedminster club will join Diaz as a guest of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N. J. Morales said she was hired despite telling a supervisor that she had no legal working documents.
The guests are intended to illustrate a contradiction between the hardline statements on immigration that Trump makes in public and the Trump Organization's business practices. Since the New York Times first reported on undocumented workers at Trump properties, the company has fired many workers for presenting fake information when they applied.
People impacted by Trump immigration policies
At least 15 Democratic lawmakers are using their tickets to bring guests who have been directly impacted by Trump's immigration policies.
There will be seven guests who are current or former beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which Trump has tried to end. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-. Y. , will bring Gerard Michaud, a Brooklyn resident from Cuba who is able to hold three jobs under a Temporary Protected Status. And Rep. Ray Lujan, D-N. M. , will bring Awn Sian Mung, a refugee from Myanmar.
Yeni González, a Guatemalan migrant who was separated from her children at the border under the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy, will attend as a guest of Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N. Y. And Albertina Contreras Teletor and Yakelin Garcia Contreras, a mother and daughter who were separated at the border, will come as guests of Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. Yakelin turns 12 on Tuesday.
Friends of the president
Controversial Rep. Steve King, who has been criticized for his comments on white supremacy, said on Twitter that he wanted to invite both Diamond and Silk, right-wing bloggers and prominent supports of the president who frequently appear on Fox News.
King noted he only had one guest ticket and Diamond "won the coin toss" and would be his guest to the event.
Pelosi's guests, including transgender military members
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will have a wide range of guests in the gallery, including her husband Paul Pelosi and daughter Alexandra Pelosi. Here is a look at some of her other guests:
Captain Jennifer Peace, U. S. Army and Major Ian Brown, U. S. Army, two transgender military members.
Jeremy Butler, the COO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America
Fred Guttenberg, father of Parkland shooting victim Jaime Guttenberg
Charlie Mirsky, co-founder and political director, March For Our Lives
Chefs José Andrés and Tyler Florence
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez
Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen
D. C. Mayor Muriel Bowser
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka
United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard
SEIU President Mary Kay Henry
National Education Association President Lily Eskelesen

Bowl not a ratings hit

Texto completo: PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The New England Patriots' competitive but action-starved Super Bowl victory over the Los Angeles Rams was seen by 100.7 million people on television and streaming services, the smallest audience for football's annual spectacle in a decade.

A boycott by disgruntled New Orleans Saints fans, a campaign by fans of quarterback Colin Kaepernick and a game with only one touchdown combined to shrink the audience.

On CBS alone, the game was seen by 98.2 million people, compared to 103.4 million who watched on NBC last year, according to the Nielsen company.

Since reaching a peak of 114.4 million viewers for the Patriots' 2015 victory over the Seattle Seahawks, the Super Bowl audience has slipped each year since. The Super Bowl is traditionally the most-watched television event of the year in the U.S., and its audience hadn't dipped below 100 million since the Pittsburgh Steelers-Arizona Cardinals game in 2009.

CBS dealt with a city that held a major grudge.

Many fans in New Orleans, where the hometown Saints were victimized by a blown referee's call toward the end of its loss to the Rams in the NFC championship, skipped the game entirely. Preliminary ratings from New Orleans showed that Super Bowl viewership this year was half what it was in 2018.

New Orleans' Times Picayune newspaper printed a mostly blank front page on Monday with the words, "Super Bowl?" What Super Bowl?"

The newspaper asked, "you think the NFL is sad that the Saints weren't in it to spice up the night?"

There was also a campaign on Twitter by people who said they would not watch the game because of Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who hasn't been able to land a job in the NFL since leading demonstrations in protest of police treatment of minorities.

After a season of offensive fireworks and conference championships that both went into overtime, Sunday's game was a defensive struggle where the teams were tied 3-3 entering the fourth quarter.

Texto completo: PASADENA, Calif. — The Patriots' competitive but action-starved Super Bowl victory over the Los Angeles Rams was seen by 100.7 million people on television and streaming services, the smallest audience for football's annual spectacle in a decade.
A boycott by disgruntled New Orleans Saints fans, a campaign by fans of quarterback Colin Kaepernick and a game with only one touchdown combined to shrink the audience. On CBS alone, the game was seen by 98.2 million people, compared to 103.4 million who watched on NBC last year, according to the Nielsen company.
Ratings were understandably strong in Boston, which drew a 57.4 overnight rating (best for the Super Bowl since 2015), and Los Angeles (44.6, best in that market since 1996). However, since reaching a peak of 114.4 million viewers for the Patriots' 2015 victory over the Seattle Seahawks, the national Super Bowl audience has slipped each year since.
The Super Bowl figures to again be the most-watched television event of the year in the US, but its broadcast audience hadn't dipped below 100 million since the Steelers-Cardinals game in 2009.
CBS dealt with a city that held a major grudge. Many fans in New Orleans, where the hometown Saints were victimized by a blown referee's call toward the end of its loss to the Rams in the NFC championship, skipped the game entirely. Preliminary ratings from New Orleans showed that Super Bowl viewership this year was half what it was in 2018.
New Orleans' Times Picayune newspaper printed a mostly blank front page on Monday with the words, "Super Bowl?" What Super Bowl?"
The newspaper asked, "You think the NFL is sad that the Saints weren't in it to spice up the night?"
There was also a campaign on Twitter by people who said they would not watch because of Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who hasn't been able to land a job in the NFL since leading demonstrations in protest of police treatment of minorities.
After a season of offensive fireworks and conference championships that both went into overtime, Sunday's game was a defensive struggle where the teams were tied 3-3 entering the fourth quarter. That's a tough slog for the casual fan, and the Super Bowl draws millions who don't watch football regularly.
At one point CBS commentator Tony Romo said, "this is hard to watch." Others were blunter still. The website The Ringer said that "the historically boring Super Bowl sent football back to the Stone Age."
Cindy Boren of The Washington Post wrote that it was "a snore of a Super Bowl." The New York Times headlined a story: "How boring was the Super Bowl? The punts got exciting."
The words "boring" and "Super Bowl" appeared in the same tweets more than 70,000 times in the past 24 hours. The words "worst" and "Super Bowl" were matched more than 50,000 times.
If anything, football fans have been spoiled by a string of competitive Super Bowls after many years in which big game blowouts became commonplace.
This year the game's outcome was in doubt until the final seconds, but it had only one touchdown and few scoring threats.
In a fragmenting market and amid declining audiences for traditional television across the board, football remains king. In 2018, 46 of the top 50 most watched telecasts were NFL games. Every time slot for NFL games earned higher ratings during the 2018 regular season, a total gain of 5 percent.
The one growth area for CBS on Sunday night was streaming. The network said an average of 2.6 million people streamed the game, up 31 percent over last year.
CBS did achieve its goal of having a large audience sample its new talent show, "The World's Best." Nielsen said 22.2 million people watched the show's debut, the most-watched entertainment show since the Oscars last year and the biggest entertainment premiere on TV since "Undercover Boss" debuted after the Super Bowl nine years ago.

Trump inaugural committee subpoenaed by federal prosecutors for financial documents

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee confirmed Monday that it had received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in New York as part of an investigation into the group’s fundraising activities.
“While we are still reviewing the subpoena, it is our intention to cooperate with the inquiry,” the committee said in a statement.
Owen Blicksilver, a committee spokesman, declined to elaborate on the scope of the government’s request.
The investigation is being led by prosecutors from the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, and represents potentially more legal trouble for the Trump administration as it continues to confront the ongoing inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and other spinoff investigations.
State of the Union: Politically wounded from the shutdown, Trump faces a tough time with his agenda
Related: When, where and how to watch President Donald Trump's 2019 State of the Union address
A copy of the new subpoena, reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, indicated that prosecutors had sought all documents linked to the committee’s fundraising activities, including donors and those who provided services to the organization.
The committee had raised more than $100 million to host events related to Trump’s inauguration.
The inaugural committee inquiry is separate from the investigation led by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller whose inquiry is focused on possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Nevertheless, prosecutors leading the inaugural probe also are believed to be reviewing whether the committee received contributions from foreign sources, according to previous accounts by the New York Times.
Federal law prohibits such donations.
The investigation rose, at least in part, out of information seized while investigating Michael Cohen, the president's former attorney and fixer.
In December, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for a host of crimes, including making secret hush payments before the 2016 election to women who accused Trump of having affairs and lying to Congress.
During April raids on Cohen's home, office, and hotel room, federal investigators discovered a taped conversation between Cohen and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who worked with the inaugural committee, the Wall Street Journal reported last year.
The contents of the recording are unclear but Wolkoff, according to the Journal, voiced concerns over how some of the inaugural funds were being spent.
Disclosure of the new subpoena also comes at a politically fraught time for Trump, who is scheduled to deliver the State of the Union address Tuesday and as a possible second government shutdown looms over a clash with Democrat lawmakers about funding for the president’s long-promised border wall.

Beware of the DNA 'magic box'

Texto completo: This year, the FBI will roll out a national Rapid DNA network - with select police departments using portable DNA testing in a "magic box" the size of a desktop printer. These magic boxes can analyze a swab, produce a profile in about two hours, and query local or the federal DNA databanks.
The federal government aggressively supports the effort through funding and legislation as it hopes to expand the coverage of its national DNA databank. The appeal of speedy DNA results is understandable, particularly where crime labs can be backlogged by many months.
Yet as coverage of the police rollout of these devices makes clear, the advent of Rapid DNA introduces many concerns. We lack much meaningful oversight of forensic science or police technology in this country. These machines are unvalidated. They use proprietary technology, so that no one, least of all the people using them, knows precisely how they work. They make errors and destroy samples, but we do not know how often.
And yet they are still being introduced at police stations around the country. Quick and dirty forensic tests will inevitably cause criminal cases to go terribly wrong: innocent people may be convicted.
Additionally, the police officers who operate these magic boxes are not necessarily trained on how to collect DNA or test it properly. They are not trained scientists working at a crime lab, and may not operate under quality controls. "I barely need a pulse to use this instrument," a detective in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, told The New York Times. He explained that he had a few hours of training from the manufacturer.
While testing a single swab from a person can be simple, these machines cannot interpret crime scene DNA samples, which can contain DNA mixtures from an unknown number of people. The few studies done of these machines have suggested high error rates, including the capability to destroy samples.
We have seen this time and time again when new portable technology is rolled out without validation or regulation. Take the story of a Tampa Bay woman who had run out of gas. When a police officer arrived, he saw pills in the car and suspected drugs, even though she insisted they were vitamins. He conducted a field test using a chemical kit, which identified them as oxycodone pills. She was charged with drug trafficking, languishing in jail for five months before the state crime lab did additional tests and found they were, in fact, vitamins.
Hers was far from an isolated case. Hundreds of wrongful convictions have come to light around the country involving field drug tests. In Harris County, Texas, an audit by the prosecutor's Conviction Integrity Unit uncovered 456 cases in which field drug tests gave erroneous results, and the convictions in those cases were all reversed. In 2016, the Texas Forensic Science Commission said these field tests are too unreliable to use in criminal cases and should always be followed up with lab tests.
Many police departments are doing just that with Rapid DNA: conducting a field test, but then sending evidence to a crime lab for a more involved check. Others may not do so. Indeed, the National District Attorney's Association has said it opposes the use of Rapid DNA machines except by experienced DNA analysts at accredited crime labs.
We badly need rules to validate these types of magic boxes. We need more commissions like the one in Texas to put a stop to error-prone technology used by untrained people. Unless new forensic technology is validated and regulated, the result will be lost evidence, the guilty going free, and the innocent getting jailed.

Crowds protest 'dark, freezing' conditions at jail

Texto completo: Brooklyn facility partly lost power nearly
a week ago
For several days, crowds have gathered outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to protest reports of freezing and dark conditions inside the jail after it partly lost power nearly a week ago.
The protesters have included relatives who said they haven't been able to visit inmates for days, as well as activists and elected officials. They've chanted "Move them out!" and demanded answers from jail officials accused of "radio silence." Some have remained at the site overnight, shivering and indignant, in solidarity with inmates.
Through it all, one thing remained constant: the relentless sound of inmates banging against the windows, some of them waving lights inside pitch-black cells in an attempt to be seen.
"All we hear are the inmates banging on the windows to get our attention," New York City Council Member Justin Brannan (D) said in a video posted to Twitter after he visited the jail Friday. "And when they see that we're here, they bang louder."
For almost a week, many of those inside the jail, which houses more than 1,600 inmates, had no heat, hot meals, hot water for showers or light in their cells, according to the New York Times, which first reported on the conditions.
For security reasons, inmates were placed on lockdown Thursday - coinciding with a polar vortex that brought record-low temperatures to parts of the country. On Wednesday and Thursday, temperatures in New York City ranged from lows in the single digits to highs in the teens.
Those with connections to inmates described deteriorating conditions, with inmates stuck inside dark, freezing cells, getting sick and "frantic," according to the Times.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons, which runs the jail near Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood, has denied that conditions are so dire. In a statement Sunday, officials said inmates had hot water for showers and in their cells' sinks, and they estimated that power would be fully restored by Monday.
Late Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) tweeted, "A federal official confirmed to me the power is back on at MDC. Make no mistake: this took people power. Thank you to the families, activists and officials who fought for the dignity of people inside."
Several lawmakers who were able to tour the jail Saturday said conditions were unacceptable and accused jail officials of not understanding the urgency of the situation.
"After visiting MDC again today it is clear the officials there have disregarded the basic human rights of inmates," Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez (D-N.Y.) tweeted. "This appalling situation needs to be fixed and I will continue pressuring [the Federal Bureau of Prisons] for immediate action."
Velázquez said one prison guard reported needing to wear fleece over a winter vest to stay warm overnight.
Late Saturday, de Blasio said the city's emergency management agency would be sending blankets, hand warmers and generators to the federal facility "whether they like it or not."
Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who also toured the jail, tweeted Saturday that it was clear officials "have been callously placing the health & safety of the inmates at this facility at risk."
He returned Sunday and reported things had improved. "Conditions are much better. It's much warmer," he tweeted Sunday. "And the electrical power will be back tomorrow morning. We will remain vigilant to insure that the health and safety of the inmates and correction officers are taken care of properly."
The updates Sunday did little to stem the anger outside the prison, where protesters once again gathered. New York Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon (D-Brooklyn) reported that although prison officials had accepted the blankets from the city the night before, they had not distributed them to inmates.
Other visitors said conditions remained poor.
"Those who . . . were told heat and hot water are on, we can assure you, this is not true," the nonprofit Justice League NYC said Sunday. "We continue to doubt their claims as elected officials and lawyers who have recently been inside the facility have seen the problems for themselves."
The nonprofit Legal Aid Society said that it had written to the MDC warden on Jan. 22, demanding that a lack of heat at the jail be addressed amid forecasts of temperatures "dangerous to human life."
"The Bureau of Prisons' response? Radio silence," the organization said Sunday. "Now they claim they have 'submitted a work ticket' to 'schedule' repairs to a dark, freezing, virtually incommunicado prison. Too little, too late."
Tensions outside the jail reached a high point Sunday afternoon when protesters approached the entrance and were pepper-sprayed by guards.
In other harrowing scenes, family members shouted through megaphones to try to communicate with inmates.
"I love you!" one prisoner could be heard yelling from a grated window.
A woman outside screamed a name at the top of her lungs in an attempt to pass on a message: "Tell him I'm out here and I love him, and I'm not leaving" until the inmates get heat, she called through a megaphone. "I've been here for two days, and I'm not leaving!"

Texto completo: Meghan Kenny was about to pick her daughter up from day care when she decided to check her email.
Sitting in the car in the day care’s parking lot, Kenny, a seventh-grade English teacher at Lancaster Country Day School English, began scrolling through the messages on her phone. When she came across one from PEN America Literary Awards, she almost deleted it. The organization frequently sends Kenny messages about book readings in Washington, D.C., and she expected this message to be more of the same.
That was, until a particular word caught her eye: “Congratulations.”
The message was notifying Kenny that her book, “The Driest Season,” was named one of five finalists for the PEN/Hemingway Award, which honors work by authors who have not previously published a full-length novel. Kenny’s publisher, W.W. Norton & Co., entered the book for consideration in the contest.
“I kind of flipped out and started crying in the day care parking lot as I read this,” Kenny says.
She composed herself, went inside to get her daughter and waited to share the news until the next day, per the contest’s request.
“The Driest Season” was released last February. Kenny previously published a collection of short stories, “Love is No Small Thing.”
“The Driest Season” is about a teenager named Cielle living in Wisconsin farm country during the 1940s who finds her father in their barn after he had hanged himself. The story revolves around the aftermath of the hanging and how it affects Cielle, her older sister and their mother.
“The novel really was such an underdog,” Kenny says. “It took four years to sell it. Nobody wanted to buy it. I had to sell it myself. So, the fact that this has happened is pretty cool.”
That struggle to sell the novel followed Kenny’s six-year writing process. While “The Driest Season” is a work of fiction, it’s inspired by Kenny’s grandmother’s childhood in southwestern Wisconsin. The personal inspiration strengthened Kenny’s attachment to the project.
“I just had a soft spot for the book, and I believed in it. ... I knew I told a good story the way I wanted to tell it, so I’m glad that I didn’t give up on it,” Kenny says.
Ann Leary of The New York Times described the book as “quiet but satisfying.”
“Not every great short story is the seed of a great novel, but Kenny by and large succeeds,” Leary writes.
Kenny says she doesn’t know for sure what makes readers resonate with this particular work, but several people have told her that the writing is accessible.
“On the most basic level, it’s about family and loss and love,” Kenny says. “I think those are all relatable things for people.”
Kenny will attend the PEN America Literary Awards ceremony on Sunday, April 7, at the JFK Library in Boston. She will learn the results prior to the awards ceremony.
“I feel like I’ve won just being a finalist,” Kenny says.
She’s started reading the books by the other finalists, and believes the competition is strong.
While she has some ideas for future projects, Kenny says she isn’t currently working on anything. With a daughter who will soon turn 1 and a large accomplishment to celebrate, Kenny has reason to relish in the present.
“I think it will be just an honor to go to the ceremony ... and who knows what will happen next,” Kenny says. “I’m just going to enjoy it.”

SHE WANTED TO DRIVE SO THE SAUDIS HAD HER IMPRISONED AND TORTURED

Texto completo: Remember this name: Loujain (Loo-JAYNE) al-Hathloul. She is 29 years old and a courageous advocate for gender equality - so she is in a Saudi Arabian prison, and reportedly our Saudi allies have tortured her, even waterboarded her.
There has properly been global outrage at Saudi Arabia's murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post and resident of Virginia. Jamal was a friend of mine, and I find it infuriating that President Donald Trump and other officials won't hold Saudi Arabia accountable for killing and dismembering him.
Still, we can't bring him back. So let's direct equal attention to those still alive - like Ms. Hathloul, along with nine other women's rights activists who are also in custody, including some who say they have endured torture, too.
Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Jared Kushner bet big on the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, but they were bamboozled. MBS isn't a great reformer, and he isn't coming clean about Khashoggi's murder.
Nor is he releasing Ms. Hathloul, who, among others, had peacefully and persistently campaigned to allow women the right to drive.
In 2014, she was arrested when she tried to drive into Saudi Arabia with a driver's license from the United Arab Emirates, nominally valid also in Saudi Arabia. Then in 2015, Ms. Hathloul was one of the first women to run for a seat on a municipal council. (She lost).
She moved to the emirates. But in 2017, Saudi security forces effectively kidnapped her and her husband and returned them to the kingdom. The couple have divorced, and while accounts differ, some believe this is because of pressure the government placed on the husband.
Shortly before women were allowed to drive last June, the government rearrested Ms. Hathloul, along with other women's rights activists who had fought for the right the government was about to grant.
"She said she had been held in solitary confinement, beaten, waterboarded, given electric shocks, sexually harassed and threatened with rape and murder," her sister, Alia al-Hathloul, who lives in Belgium, wrote in a searing op-ed in The New York Times this month, recounting what Ms. Hathloul had told their parents when they saw her. "My parents then saw that her thighs were blackened by bruises."
Despite being threatened with rape and murder and having her body thrown into the sewage system, Ms. Hathloul would not stay silent and reported the torture to her parents. Her sister said she was "shaking uncontrollably, unable to hold her grip, to walk or sit normally."
The other imprisoned women suffered similar treatment, according to Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and their families. They were said to have been subjected to electric shocks, whippings, forced kissing and hugging, threats of rape and more. Some were tied to a metal bed and flogged.
"Loujain's abuse exemplifies the methods of Saudi thuggish and lawless leadership, hellbent on exacting sadistic vengeance against any citizen who dares to think freely," Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch told me. "The Saudi people owe a huge debt to Loujain."
A government spokesman did not respond to my inquiries about why Ms. Hathloul was imprisoned and tortured. A pro-government newspaper did suggest she is a traitor who could even deserve to be executed.
In recent years, Saudi Arabia has stepped up the pace of executions, with about 150 reported last year. Apparently for the first time, prosecutors have sought the death penalty for a woman who is a nonviolent human rights defender, Israa al-Ghomgham.
Mr. Trump is right that Saudi Arabia is an important ally. That's why it's important that it have a decent, modernizing leader, rather than one who feuds with neighbors, kidnaps Lebanon's prime minister, invades Yemen, murders a journalist and tortures outspoken women.
Saudi politics are murky, but there are whispers that the crown prince may not be elevated to king on the death of his father. Yet Messrs. Trump, Pompeo and Kushner are acting as MBS' protectors and backers - so the world could be stuck with MBS as a destabilizing and oppressive ruler for the next half century.

From Vanity Fair to Air Mail

Texto completo: Graydon Carter, the former editor of Vanity Fair, is starting Air Mail, an all-digital international news platform intended for worldly cosmopolitans, with Alessandra Stanley, who was a longtime critic and reporter for The New York Times.
Beginning this summer, Air Mail will be packaged as a weekly newsletter, featuring magazine-length original articles sent to subscribers on Saturday at 6 a.m. Stories and original podcasts will also be available on a website: AirMail.news.
According to Mr. Carter, the idea is to keep well-heeled globalists up to speed on the latest fads, fashions, arts, riots, scandals, and political upheavals in Europe and Asia. Think of it a bit like The Economist with attitude, or maybe "the weekend edition of a nonexistent international daily," he said, slouching in an office chair in his garden-level West Village office on a recent, chilly Monday. He was wearing gray flannel trousers, a blue fleece vest and his trademark curvilinear hairstyle.
Mr. Carter also suggested the new venture might be like the weekend edition of the Financial Times, which he loves, but "is hard to get -- you've got to be in the metropolitan city, it's $7, or at least it is where I spend the weekends in the country, you've got to get out of your pajamas to get it."
He and Ms. Stanley plan to start out with a small team of editors, many of them young, hoping to reach members of the Snapchat generation as well as people old enough to share Mr. Carter's romantic associations with those old-school Air Mail envelopes with the red and blue borders, which he still uses for bookmarks.
They want the readership of creative professionals who travel business class to know the latest vegan currywurst hot spots in Berlin, and crave more gravitas from foreign dispatches than, say, is in Monocle's earnest short profiles on sustainability-minded Danish design executives.
"The marketing executive in Soho House with the shaved head -- that's the Monocle reader," said Mr. Carter, 69. "I don't know what ours is yet, but I just have a rough idea. They'll be a sophisticated person. They're not backpackers, and they're not in Las Vegas, drinking Champagne and sitting around in their heart-shaped bathtub."
Air Mail will steer clear of Washington politics. The newsletter, Mr. Carter said, is "designed to live in a Trump-free world" (he has been an antagonist of the president since the 1980s, when Spy magazine, which Mr. Carter co-founded, branded Mr. Trump a "short-fingered vulgarian").
In his office at Vanity Fair, Mr. Carter lined one wall with framed copies of the 49 tweets that Mr. Trump had directed at him. ("I always used to say, 'This is the only wall he's built,"' Mr. Carter said.)
With yellow-vest protests roiling France, Italian populists threatening an "Italexit" from the European Union, and a Chinese economic slowdown threatening the world economy, he and Ms. Stanley, 63, believe that American readers that are more interested than ever in matters abroad. "Trump has gone so inward, so nationalistic, that readers are rebelling by going more global," she said by telephone.
Brexit is an obvious example. "To most Americans, Brexit is both an important but confusing story, that unfolds in a different direction every single week," Mr. Carter said. That is why the duo has commissioned Francis Wheen, from Private Eye, the satirical British news publication, to write a humorous column called This Week in Brexit.
But Air Mail does not seek to compete with, say, Foreign Affairs, the international-relations journal published by the Council on Foreign Relations. "This is not homework," Ms. Stanley said.
Rather, it should feel like "a calm read for a weekend, where you may stay in bed for two hours," reading about food, film and football, which is "bigger than Norad and NATO and the United Nations," Mr. Carter said.
One might fairly expect any publication of his to contain at least a smattering of aristocrats-behaving-badly stories, like the ones Mr. Carter used to find in foreign newspapers to pursue for Vanity Fair. But "there's not much in the way of high-end scandal in America right now," he said. "We're going through a drought of rich people knifing each other, or shooting each other, or cheating each other."
What about the British royal family? "Unless Meghan Markle starts strangling Prince Philip or something," he said, "I have no interest in them."
And while Air Mail will sample articles culled from European and Asian publications, it will not be a globetrotter's Axios, boiling down the latest headlines into easy-to-digest morsels.
"These are fully formed narratives," Mr. Carter said. "Vanity Fair was in the excellence business, and I want to stay in the excellence business. We're not after clickbait."
Media models have undergone scrutiny lately after layoffs at Buzzfeed and HuffPost.
The subscription rate is still under discussion, but will be reasonable, and will, in theory, help Air Mail avoid the revenue shortfalls of media companies that depend solely upon advertising. "You know, if Howard Schultz gave away coffee for free, Starbucks would be the most popular food organization on Earth -- for about two weeks," Mr. Carter said.
Each issue is intended to have a single sponsor, ideally a luxury advertiser drawn to an upscale readership. Air Mail has also secured backing from TPG Growth, the private equity powerhouse that has a stake in Creative Artists Agency and Vice; James Coulter, a billionaire investor who is one of the firm's two chief executives, is a friend of Mr. Carter's.
And if none of those elites end up subscribing to Air Mail, he does not seem like he will be crushed. He recently spent a year in Provence (where he considered buying an English-language bookshop and settling full-time with his wife Anna), completed one chapter of a still-untitled memoir, and is resolute about being done with office towers.
"I never want to have a swipe card again," he said.

Is This the Right Way to End a War?

Texto completo: Afghanistan long ago took from Vietnam the title of America's longest war, when it passed the 13-year mark in 2014.
Five years later, with the recent possibility of a peace deal that would bring another American withdrawal from an unpopular war, comparisons of the two conflicts are once again rife -- even among many of the leaders America has sent to Afghanistan in recent years.
Ryan Crocker, who was twice America's top diplomat in Kabul, led the chorus of people sensing déjà vu. "It just reminds me of the Paris peace talks on Vietnam," Mr. Crocker, now diplomat-in-residence at Princeton, said. "By going to the table, we basically were telling the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, 'We surrender, we're here just to work out the terms."'
He was comparing the Paris negotiations that lead to America's withdrawal from Vietnam with six days of talks between the American envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar. The talks ended Jan. 26 in a preliminary agreement that American troops would be withdrawn in exchange for Taliban guarantees not to allow terrorists to attack America again. "I just cannot see this getting to any better place," Mr. Crocker said. "We don't have a whole lot of leverage here. I can't see this as anything more than putting lipstick on what will be a U.S. withdrawal."
A comparison of the two wars has not been fashionable for many years now, with scholars pointing out that superficial similarities were greatly outweighed by the differences. Vietnam took place at the height of the Cold War, with the superpowers on opposite sides. Vietnam and Afghanistan are dramatically different in culture, geography and history. Even the scale of the two wars was vastly different: Half a million American troops went to Vietnam at its height, compared with a maximum of 100,000 to Afghanistan, now whittled down to 14,000; more than 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam, fewer than 3,000 in Afghanistan.
Yet a significant number of the American ambassadors and military leaders who served in Afghanistan are worried about the similarities. Karl Eikenberry, the American military commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007, and then the American ambassador in 2009 to 2011, said that in both countries it was a challenge to develop a national force committed to protecting the weak and corrupt central government. And in both places, the host country's forces, many of them trained by the United States, "were further undermined because they constantly doubted the long-term support of the U.S.," said Mr. Eikenberry, who is now a professor at Stanford.
Mr. Crocker is among those who worry that the Trump administration just wants out of Afghanistan and is willing to sacrifice gains that have been made, particularly on behalf of women. A rushed deal could put the Taliban in a position to eventually take over, as happened in Vietnam when the United States withdrew its troops even though the North Vietnamese did not keep their promise to do the same.
"I imagine we and the Afghans have killed most of the slow and stupid" Taliban fighters, Mr. Crocker said. "The ones who are still in the Taliban after 18 years are now tough, committed, and I can't imagine them signing on to any meaningful compromise. They'll just talk compromise."
Not all recent ambassadors are prone to drawing parallels to Vietnam. James Cunningham, who was ambassador from 2012 through 2014 and is now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said fear that the United States will cut and run is "definitely a concern for a lot of people back here, and for the Afghans I know. And there may be some people who want that to happen." But he said the analogy wasn't accurate. In America, he said, "there's a lot of sympathy for the Afghans and what they're trying to do. This doesn't have to be a recipe for rushing to the exits and I hope it won't be."
Mr. Cunningham is not convinced that the Trump administration will pull out, even though many of the president's supporters in Washington want it to. "It's no secret the president would like to leave, as did his predecessor and presumably his predecessor, but reality and conditions have a way of intruding," he said.
Many experts also see lessons from Vietnam for the American experience in Afghanistan, often in terms of "you've learned so well from your mistakes that you can repeat them exactly," as a diplomat in Afghanistan put it.
Anthony Cordesman, an official in the Defense Department during the final years of the Vietnam War, recently wrote a paper detailing the parallels between the two wars. In an interview, Mr. Cordesman, now a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, recalled how late in the Vietnam War "we concealed the casualty rates, the absentee rates, the ghost soldier rates," just as the American military and the government of President Ashraf Ghani are doing now.
"Just as in Vietnam, under the shell of top leadership there were many deep divisions," Mr. Cordesman said. In Afghanistan, "you have a country of power brokers. A lot of the underlying economy is extremely weak, buoyed up by war and aid. And as that's reduced, you find less and less reason for the economy and political structure to hold together."
In some ways, Afghanistan is actually in worse shape than South Vietnam was when the American military left in 1973; the country fell to the Communists in 1975. In Afghanistan, "the only major hard currency earner is the narcotics sector, other than war and aid," Mr. Cordesman said. Vietnam, in contrast, had a more diverse economy. Even the Afghan military units are weaker. "There were some very good units in Vietnam," he said.
The British historian Max Hastings, author of the recent book "Vietnam, an Epic Tragedy 1945-1975," said he sees many similarities between Vietnam and Afghanistan. "Western governments and commanders still don't seem to have got the message that winning firefights is meaningless unless we can also achieve a real cultural, social and political engagement with local societies," he said.
"For most people in Afghanistan, as in Vietnam, daily life represents an endless series of accommodations, compromises and judgments about who is likely to win," Mr. Hastings said. "Most of them today put their money on the Taliban not necessarily because they like them, but because they seem likely to be around longer than us."
Mr. Eikenberry said that an even better comparison than Vietnam might be to the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989. Like the United States, the Soviets no longer wanted to shoulder the responsibility and expense of Afghanistan at a time of declining power and prestige. "Both Vietnam and Afghanistan were, ultimately, wars of choice," Mr. Eikenberry said. "And because of the incredible wealth and power of the U.S., we were able to make the choices -- which both proved bad ones."

Texto completo: The United States announced Friday it is withdrawing from a nuclear arms control treaty with Russia. President Trump claimed that the Russians had violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty. Some analysts said they worried a new nuclear arms race could be sparked.
It's the latest in a series of controversial moves by the Trump administration to pull out of international agreements and organizations. Here's a list of what Trump has done so far — and threats he's made of further withdrawals.
Paris climate agreement Trump announced in June 2017 he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord. Trump sided with conservatives who argued the 2015 agreement was bad for the US economy. Critics said he was weakening global efforts to stop climate change.
Iran nuclear deal Trump announced in May 2018 he was pulling the United States out of the agreement to curb Iran's nuclear weapons program. Experts said the move would isolate the United States from its allies who remained in the deal, and they worried that Iran could resume its push to get a nuclear weapon. So far, according to the US intelligence community, Iran hasn't.
TPP Shortly after he took office in 2017, Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that included 12 Pacific Rim countries. Trump said he was doing it for American workers. Critics said he was creating an opening for economic heavyweight China to expand its influence in the region.
NAFTA Trump has threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, the trade pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. He has negotiated a new agreement with the two countries, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but now needs congressional approval for it. It's not clear whether he will get it and, if not, what happens next.
UNESCO The Trump administration announced in October 2017 it would withdraw from UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural organization.
UNHRC The Trump administration withdrew from the United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2018.
UNRWA The Trump administration announced in August 2018 it was ending its decades of funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency, which helps Palestinian refugees.
Could NATO be next? Several times over the course of 2018, Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, senior administration officials told the New York Times. Critics say withdrawing would embolden Russia and endanger peace in Europe. Days after the Times report in mid-January, the US House passed bipartisan legislation expressing support for NATO. The Senate also has a bipartisan bill pending that is aimed at preventing the president from withdrawing from NATO without Senate approval.

Texto completo: RICHMOND – "Romantic Masterpieces from Central Europe" is the theme of the Richmond Symphony Orchestra's concert at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 2, in Civic Hall.
Maestro Guy Bordo selected Beethoven's great "Pastoral" Symphony No. 6 to open this masterworks concert. RSO will feature "Changing Faces," a commissioned piece by American composer Alyssa Morris. The concert will close with special guest cellist Andrés Díaz playing the great Schumann Cello Concerto.
The RSO perform of "Changing Faces" will be the piece's world premiere, and marks her return to Civic Hall, where she was formerly the associate principal oboe for the orchestra. As a composer, Morris has been acclaimed for her "skillful," "fashionable," and "commendable" musicianship, according to a release. Regarding "Changing Faces," Morris said, "Every person wears so many different faces in a lifetime, or even in a single day. We wear the game face, the poker face, or the straight face. Because we are experiencing the myriad of emotions that is life, we must always be changing faces. ... In 'Changing Faces' a single phrase wears different faces...chang(ing) as if to signify our own changing states of mind. 'Changing Faces' depicts one of the many beautiful aspects of being a human being: the ability to experience and express the full spectrum of emotions."
"Changing Faces" was commissioned with funding from the Women's Fund and Paul Kriese.
Díaz will be welcomed back to the stage to close the concert with the great Schumann Cello Concerto. Since winning first prize in the 1986 Naumburg International Cello Competition, Díaz has exhilarated both critics and audiences with his intense and charismatic performances. He has earned exceptional reviews for his "strongly personal interpretive vision" (The New York Times) and his "bold and imaginative" playing (The Boston Globe).
Students in grades K-12 have the opportunity to attend RSO performances free. Admission for college students is $10 and for adults is $20. To order tickets for the Saturday performance or receive additional information about the Richmond Symphony Orchestra and its programs, go to richmondsymphony.org, call 765-966-5181 or email rso@richmondsymphony.org.
To accompany the world premiere of "Changing Faces," Morris will make dual presentations on Friday, Feb. 1. A Brown Bag Luncheon will be at noon at Earlham College's Center for Visual and Performing Arts Atrium. A Composer Forum with Morris will be at 4:30 p.m. Friday at Friends Fellowship Community Room. Both presentations are free to the public and welcome to the entire community.
Future free events for RSO include:
Recital series featuring Adagio Trio at 4 p.m.Feb. 10 in Bethany Theological Seminary's Nicarry Chapel. This unique combination of the harp, flute and cello provides uplifting and soothing music, with a mixture of classical, folk, religion and Celtic music.
A free RSO Brass concert conducted by Guy Bordo at 3 p.m. Feb. 24 at Holy Family Catholic Church.

Texto completo: 1. The Last Pass: Cousy, Russell, the Celtics, and What Matters in the End, by Gary M. Pomerantz
“The Last Pass” surely stands as one of the most intriguing sports books in recent memory, and maybe of all time. After all, it bares the soul of one superstar athlete, Bob Cousy, as he reflects, at age 90, on his career with the Boston Celtics, and especially on his relationship with the team’s other great star, Bill Russell. Cousy and Russell enjoyed excellent chemistry on the court, as evidenced by the team’s many championship banners. Cousy, however, has regrets that he didn’t do more during the volatile civil rights era to publicly support Russell during his rocky encounters with discrimination. The depth of Cousy’s thinking on this subject is striking, as are his many highly personal thoughts on life both in and out of basketball. Author Gary Pomerantz seems to have captured them all in vivid detail by interviewing Cousy 53 times over two and a half years. 
2. Big Fella: Babe Ruth and the World He Created, by Jane Leavy
Surely, baseball fans must be thinking, there’s no need for another biography of Babe Ruth, who has been the subject of so many books. New York Times bestselling author Jane Leavy felt otherwise and has written one of the most exhaustive portraits to date of Ruth, this on the heels of heralded biographies of fellow baseball greats Sandy Koufax and Mickey Mantle. Two aspects where Leavy’s tremendous research really pays off is in examining Ruth’s early childhood and in analyzing his partnership with agent Christy Walsh, who helped Babe achieve maximum fame while also serving as a surrogate father. Also receiving special attention is a 21-day barnstorming tour Ruth took after his record-setting 60-home-run 1927 season, when he joined with Lou Gehrig in what Walsh promoted as a “Symphony of Swat.”
3. We Want Fish Sticks: The Bizarre and Infamous Rebranding of the New York Islanders, by Nicholas Hirshon  
Has a sports book ever had a more unusual title than “We Want Fish Sticks”? Probably not. The inspiration for it is the mocking chant that opposing fans once used to taunt the NHL’s New York Islanders. They were making fun of the franchise’s ill-fated decision to rebrand itself in the mid-1990s, dropping a distinctive logo with a map of Long Island for a cartoonish fisherman who reminded people of the Gorton’s frozen seafood mascot. The switch was made after the fortunes of the Islanders, who won four straight Stanley Cup championships in the early 1980s, had sunk so low as to set off alarm bells. This is the story of the three desperate years in the 1990s when the club tried to redefine itself under an owner who wound up in prison for bank and wire fraud.  
4. Women on the Move: The Forgotten Era of Women’s Bicycle Racing, by Roger Gilles
It may be hard to imagine, but the heyday of women’s bike racing in the United States occurred at the turn of the last century – from 1895 to 1902, to be precise. That was long before professional team sports hit their stride and at a time when a bicycle craze swept the country. The period is thoroughly chronicled in “Women on the Move,” which recounts how racing on tracks in indoor arenas captivated the public, shed stereotypes of female fragility, and produced America’s first women sports stars – Tillie Anderson, Lizzie Glaw, and Dottie Farnsworth. Sadly, the enterprise came to a halt after two of these stars died, Farnsworth following a cycling accident while performing for a circus and Glaw from illness shortly after she retired from racing.
5. Down the Fairway, by Robert T. Jones, Jr. and O.B. Keeler  
The cover of “Down the Fairway” shows Bobby Jones completing the swing that took him to golfing greatness during the 1920s and ‘30s. What makes this book unusual, though, is that it was written by Jones in 1927 at the tender age of 24, along with sports journalist O.B. Keeler. A classic, it was republished in 2001 and now is enjoying a third time in print. The publisher, Lyons Press, calls it "part memoir, part golf instructional book, [and] part golf history." Jones penned it after becoming the first golfer to win the US and British Open championships in the same year (1926), when he may have thought he’d reached the pinnacle of his career. As it turned out, four years later, he improved on that by becoming the first and only player to win all four major tournaments to complete a Grand Slam in one calendar year. From there, he returned to his law practice in Atlanta and founded the Augusta National Golf Club, the home of the Masters in Georgia.  
6. The League That Didn’t Exist: A History of the All-America Football Conference, 1946-1949, by Gary Webster  
Over the years, a number of upstart leagues envisioned competing against the National Football League. Some never even played a game, and only one, the All-America Football Conference, survived more than two seasons. During its first three seasons (1946, ’47, and ’48), the league managed to draw more fans than an NFL that was busy finding its postwar footing. Judging the story of the AAFC from the title, “The League That Didn’t Exist,” is rather misleading. Things, of course, did collapse after the AAFC’s fourth season, but its memory lives on in the form of two AAFC teams the NFL absorbed in 1950, the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers.
7. The Greatest Hockey Stories Ever Told, edited by Bryant Urstadt  
Hockey may be the least-written-about of the major team sports, but this anthology manages to mine 16 stories that even a casual fan can enjoy. It starts off, as one might anticipate, with a retrospective of the 1980 US men’s Olympic team Miracle on Ice and wraps up with part of the screenplay from the funny take on minor-league hockey, “Slap Shot,” written by Nancy Dowd. In between are pieces by two literary heavyweights: Pulitzer Prize winner William Faulkner, who wrote about attending a 1955 NHL game for Sports Illustrated, and George Plimpton, the editor of The Paris Review, whose experience suiting up for the Boston Bruins to play goalie in an exhibition was the basis of his book, “Open Net.” 
8. The Cost of These Dreams: Sports Stories and Other Serious Business, by Wright Thompson
“The Cost of These Dreams” is clearly aimed at sports fans who enjoy long-form profiles, such as those Wright Thompson, a senior writer for ESPN The Magazine, contributes to its pages. In this collection of articles, he demonstrates his storytelling talents by probing the personalities of some of the biggest names in sports, both past and present, including Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Ted Williams, and Bear Bryant. 
9. Now Taking the Field: Baseball’s All-Time Dream Teams for All 30 Franchises, by Tom Stone  
Author Tom Stone says he started writing the book in 1983, at the age of 10. That, of course, requires a bit of explaining. What he’s referring to is the time that even young baseball fans spend in rating players, often those on their favorite teams. Stone, however, is far more ambitious than that and culls together the dream lineups for all 30 major league teams, which accounts for the doorstop, more-than-600-page size of the book. He realizes that baseball inspires a steady stream of such ranking books. His fuses to some degree the latest performing metrics with more traditional stats, and he also goes so far as to pick separate starting lineups against right-handed and left-handed pitching.

‘Home in on’ or ‘hone in on’?

Resumen: These phrases mean the same thing. Are they both correct, or are the newspapers getting it wrong about half the time?

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=%26lsquo%3BHome+in+on%26rsquo%3B+or+%26lsquo%3Bhone+in+on%26rsquo%3B%3F&amp;author=Mohr%2C+Melissa&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-01-31&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;issn=0882-7729&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Ahispanicnews_

Texto completo: If you take a look at any major American newspaper, you’ll see the phrase “to home in on.” A New York Times article discusses how important it is “to home in on millennials” to create a successful business; The Wall Street Journal notes that “one of the first big companies to home in on performance management” has now abandoned its annual review process; The Christian Science Monitor explains how sharks’ sense of smell helps them “home in on dinner.” 
Reading the very same newspapers, though, you’ll see “to hone in on” too. Understanding the origins of water on earth will help scientists “hone in on planets that might also have ingredients for life”; there are ways “to hone in on a deal and save some money” while traveling; new legislation will “hone in on” some problem areas in American sanctions against Iran. 
These phrases mean the same thing, “to find and move directly toward something” or “to narrow one’s focus.” Are they both correct, or are the newspapers getting it wrong about half the time?  
Home in on came first, although neither phrase is particularly old. It comes from a verb that we encounter much more often as a noun: home , which means “to return home.” Most commonly it is used of pigeons, which can be released hundreds of miles away and navigate back to their loft. (The record distance appears to be 7,200 miles for a pigeon who “homed” to Paris from Vietnam!)
In the 20th century, the verb’s use expanded to include inanimate things that also move or are guided toward a target, such as airplanes, missiles, or boats, and it gained its prepositions “in on.” Around the same time, it came to describe focusing one’s attention in a particular direction: “The politician homed in on the working classes as key to her support.”
Hone , of course, means “to sharpen or refine” whether a razor, a cooking technique, or one’s wit. Hone is a transitive verb – you have to hone something – so, taken literally, “to hone in on” doesn’t make sense. Not making sense doesn’t make it wrong, per se. Hone in on appears a mere 10 years after home in on , either because people immediately started mixing up the “m” and the “n” or because, as Merriam-Webster speculates, honing “figuratively involves a narrowing or sharpening of focus” and thus seems to fit. 
If you look at newspapers outside the United States, you’ll see that home in is overwhelmingly preferred, appearing worldwide with 70 percent more frequency than hone in , according to Fowler’s Modern English Usage. Even so, in the US, usage is divided just about equally between home and hone .
Are the newspapers wrong, then? We have “homned” in on a problem.

Texto completo: Headnote Commentary
Exactly 81 years ago on Jan. 24, 1938, the idea of Jack and Jill of America was birthed in Philadelphia (before the group was incorporated as a national organization in 1946) when twenty-one Black mothers who had grown up in South Philly established an association "to provide social, cultural, and educational opportunities for [Black] youth between the ages of two and 19."
It currently consists of over 10,000 mother members representing more than 40,000 parents and children in 230 chapters throughout the country. And its mission consists of "nurturing future African American leaders by strengthening children through leadership development, volunteer service, philanthropic giving, and civic duty."
If that's what Jack and Jill is and if that's what Jack and Jill does, why do so many Black folks state that it's nothing more than a bunch of elitist, bourgeois, light-skinned Blacks who want to be White? Why do many Black folks state that Lawrence Otis Graham was condemning groups like Jack and Jill when he wrote his seminal book entitled Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class? The answer to both questions is quite simple. The Black folks who make those statements, as we say in the hood, "don't know what they talkin' bout." Here's the real story.
At the outset, I must admit that, in its early years, this "by invitation only" organization appeared rather snobbish by being preoccupied with proper etiquette, debutante cotillions, ballets, symphonies, horseback-riding, skiing, and the like. Also, members were almost exclusively well educated professional women such as lawyers, physicians, professors, CEOs, ministers, etc. or wives of lawyers, physicians, professors, CEOs, ministers, etc.
And don't forget that color-conscious thing. Jack and Jill has always had that image, whether founded or unfounded. As Marianne Rohrlich wrote in a 1998 New York Times article, that image "can be traced to the group's early decades when some Blacks saw it as open only to those who had 'good hair' and were able to pass 'the paper-bag test...'"
In fact, when one of Jack and Jill's founding members, namely Louise Truitt Dench, was interviewed for that column and was asked about dark-skinned members during her time, she replied, "I didn't know a lot of dark-skinned people. I just didn't know them."
Moreover, in 1993, the Chicago Tribune reported, "In its heyday, Jack and Jill was a prestigious club for those then considered, almost literally, the cream of Black society... [It]... helped Black children, many from lighter-skinned families, to fit into White America."
As a result of such misguidance, miscommunication, or misunderstanding, membership declined.
However, in the mid-1970s/late-1980s, added the Chicago Tribune, there was a resurgence in membership due to more Blacks being able to afford to move into the suburbs, which led to the organization's "new mission that reflects the isolation felt by many Blacks living in predominantly White suburbs. Instead of helping Blacks assimilate into White culture, the organization is seeking to instill a sense of ethnic pride in suburban Black children."
In the aforementioned New York Times article, Yale-educated commercial real estate broker Elizabeth Martin, a Jack and Jill member raising a child in upper-middle class nearly all-White Summit, NJ, was asked in connection with the organization's 60th anniversary why she had joined. She replied, "When my [five-year-old] son came home from kindergarten and asked why his hair was different from the other boys' in his class, I knew we needed Jack and Jill." She went on to say, "Parents don't want their kids to lose a sense of themselves, and culturally, it's very important to be with people like yourself..."
That same year, her North Jersey Chapter held "Afrocentric events like Kwanzaa... and [a] ceremony for nine college-bound teenagers, modeled on an African rite of passage." That rite of passage was led by a history professor from Sierra Leone who gave each boy a carved wooden spear to acknowledge his "fathers from Africa" while telling them 'You are now warriors from a great tradition of warriors" and gave each girl a palm plant exemplifying "[powerful African] fertility."
Despite appearances (and a few missteps) throughout its existence since 1938, Jack and Jill of America, Incorporated- especially during the past four decades or so- has been about promoting the cause of Black people and their history, which explains why its official 2018-2020 Chapters' Programmatic Thrust is centered first on "culture" followed by "education, health, civic" issues, and "social/recreational" activities.
Additionally, among many other annual events, it sponsors "National Black Family Day," which began in May 1987 to "focus on... the cultural heritage of African American families...(and hold) workshops on the need for Black adoptions..." Along with that is a "focus on the needs... of children in Africa..."
And since 1968, Jack and Jill's foundation has continued to provide millions of dollars in funding to pro-Black groups including, but not limited to, Africare (the largest and oldest African American founded entity providing development aid to African countries), the United Negro College Fund, King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, and NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
Also, it sponsors "Carole Robertson Day" to acknowledge her (who was the daughter of the organization's Southeastern Regional Director) along with the three other little girls brutally murdered in the racist bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham on Sept. 15, 1963. The purpose of the event is to "highlight the goals of human rights and civil rights."
We all can't and shouldn't be members of woke groups like the Black Panther Party. We all can't and shouldn't be like yours truly, the "Angriest Black Man in America" who's also a loudmouthed revolutionary activist. When it comes to the struggle for racial justice, we Black folks gotta "get in where we fit in" and stay in our lane. We gotta fight for our people whichever way and wherever we feel most effective. Jack and Jill is quite effective in pursuing racial justice in the way it chooses to do so.
As a Black woman, man, girl, or boy, it's not about your color complexion. It's about your cultural commitment. Jack and Jill has been and still is committed.
By the way, Jack and Jill members come in all shades of Blackness. They include deep brown chocolate members. They also include sweet butter almond ice cream members - but don't hate on those light-skinned ones by hating on the organization's early history. After all, Malcolm X, Adam Clayton Powell, and Louis Farrakhan were/are "light, bright, and damn near white." But nobody's "Blacker" than them.

Ugly trend of demonizing white men

Texto completo: Rush Limbaugh’s December 2018 Limbaugh Letter has an article titled "Demonizing White Men." It highlights — with actual quotations from people in the media, academia and the political and entertainment arenas — the attack on white men as a class. You can decide whether these statements are decent, moral or even sensible. Should we support their visions?
Don Lemon, a CNN anchorman, said, "We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them." Steven Clifford, former King Broadcasting CEO, said, "I will be leading a great movement to prohibit straight white males, who I believe supported Donald Trump by about 85 percent, from exercising the franchise (to vote), and I think that will save our democracy." Teen Vogue, a magazine targeting teenage girls, wrote, "Not only is white male terrorism as dangerous as Islamic extremism, but our collective safety rests in rooting out the source of their radicalization." Economist Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist, wrote a column titled "The Angry White Male Caucus," in which he explained, "Trumpism is all about the fear of losing traditional privilege."
There have been similar despicable statements made by academics. James Livingston, a Rutgers history professor: "OK, officially, I now hate white people. ... I hereby resign from my race." Stacey Patton, a Morgan State University professor: "There is nothing more dangerous in the United States than a white man who has expected to succeed and finds himself falling behind." Stony Brook University sociology professor Michael Kimmel explained, "White men’s anger comes from the potent fusion of two sentiments: entitlement and a sense of victimization."
Not to be outdone, entertainers have hopped on the demonizing-white-men bandwagon. Joy Behar, talking on ABC’s "The View" about senators supporting Kavanaugh, said: "These white men — old, by the way — are not protecting women. They’re protecting a man who is probably guilty." Actress Gabourey Sidibe, also on "The View," said: "Older white men are a problem, y’all, for everyone. We’re all at risk." Moira Donegan wrote an article for The Guardian titled "Half of white women continue to vote Republican. What’s wrong with them?"
That is just a partial list of statements that would be viewed and condemned as racist simply by replacing "white men" with "black men," "Mexican men" or "Asian men." You can bet the rent money that university presidents and media executives would sanction any of their employees for making similar broad, sweeping statements about nonwhite men. Suppose a white anchorman said, "Black people are the greatest murder threat in this country." I guarantee you that he’d be shown the door.
There are only two ways to explain the silence by people who should know better. Either they agree with the sentiments expressed or they are out-and-out cowards. Decent American people ought to soundly reject and condemn this brazen attack on white men. I think that the attack is on masculinity itself and that white men are a convenient scapegoat — for now.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – After a number of reports revealed that Trump Organization employed undocumented immigrants, the company said it is expanding its system for checking the legal status of new employees.
The Washington Post reported that President Donald Trump's company plans to start using E-Verify, a system that checks federal databases to determine whether a person is eligible to work in the U. S.
"We are instituting E-Verify on all of our properties as soon as possible," Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons who helps run the company, told the Washington Post. "We’re starting with the golf properties, and we are going to be doing all of them. "
Eric Trump's comments followed a number of reports of illegal immigrants working at Trump's properties, including his hotels and golf clubs.
Over the weekend, the Post reported that dozens of undocumented employees had been fired due to their legal status in the country. The firings came amid a fierce debate over illegal immigrants and a wall along the southern U. S. border, Trump's signature campaign promise.
The impasse over a wall left the government shutdown for 35 days, the longest in U. S. history.
Throughout his campaign and presidency, Trump has highlighted the negatives of hiring undocumented workers. He has said using E-Verify would help halt the flow of illegal immigrants into the U. S. , even asking for more money in the 2019 budget to expand the program across the nation.
The Post noted that Eric Trump's comments were the first time the company or the Trump family has addressed the legal status of some of its workers after a New York Times story in December revealed several women had worked at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, N. J. for years, one even tended the president's room and made his bed.
The president, in an interview with the Post on Tuesday, used the undocumented workers to highlight a change needed in the U. S. immigration system but did not address why illegal immigrants were hired at his businesses.
"This is why we have to fix our immigration system," Trump told the Post. "I am a big proponent for allowing people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. "
Eric Trump told the Washington Post that the company uses E-Verify at some of its businesses, including in states where it's required, and a third-party service at some of the other properties to conduct background checks.
But the president's son said the workers offered false documents to show they were in the U. S. legally, making it hard for the company to know.
"This situation is not unique to Trump Organization — it is one that all companies face," Eric Trump told the Post. "It demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately. "

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - Negotiators for the U.S. and the Taliban insurgents have reached "agreements in principle on key issues for a peace deal that would end 17 years of war in Afghanistan, the top U.S. envoy said Monday.
The statement by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad followed six days of talks last week with the Taliban in Qatar, where he urged the Islamic insurgent group to enter into direct negotiations with the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
Ghani on Monday assured Afghans that their rights will not be compromised in the name of peace with the Taliban, who have been staging near-daily attacks against Afghan forces, causing scores of casualties every week. Their offensive has not let up despite the severe Afghan winter and the insurgents now hold sway over nearly half of the country.
Khalilzad said in an interview with The New York Times that an agreement in principle was reached with the Taliban on the framework of a peace deal "which still has to be fleshed out that will see the insurgents commit to guaranteeing that Afghan territory is not used as a "platform for international terrorist groups or individuals.
He said the deal could lead to a full pullout of U.S. troops in return for a cease-fire and Taliban talks with the Afghan government.
In his statement released by the U.S. Embassy, Khalilzad said, "We made progress on vital issues in our discussions and agreed to agreements in principle on a couple of very important issues.
"There is a lot more work to be done before we can say we have succeeded in our efforts but I believe for the first time I can say that we have made significant progress, he said.
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said he has been briefed on the talks and described them as encouraging, but he also told reporters that the department has not been directed to prepare for a full withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Speaking before a meeting at the Pentagon with Shanahan, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said any discussion about the withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan would be premature. He said Khalilzad had briefed NATO allies on the talks weeks ago.
"We are in Afghanistan to create the conditions for a peaceful negotiated solution, Stoltenberg said. "We will not stay longer than necessary, but we will not leave before we have a situation that enables us to leave or reduce the number of troops without jeopardizing the main goal of our presence and that is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for international terrorists once again.
He added that he believes it's too soon to speculate on withdrawal because "what we have to do now is to support the efforts to try to find a peaceful solution. We strongly support those efforts.
Ghani sought to assure Afghans that no deals would be made without Kabul's awareness and full participation.
"Our commitment is to provide peace and to prevent any possible disaster, Ghani said in an address to the nation. "There are values that are not disputable, such as national unity, national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Ghani's office said he and Khalilzad met late Sunday in Kabul to discuss details from the talks.
Khalilzad's statement emphasized the inclusion of the Afghan government in the talks.
"There is a false narrative that Afghans are not included. That is not true. The Afghan voice is there, he said. "We are working together to get to a comprehensive cease-fire. We are working with the Afghan government, with international partners, to find implementing mechanisms to reach these goals.
Khalilzad has met with the Taliban on a number of occasions in recent months in the latest bid to end America's longest war. The U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to topple the Taliban, who were harboring Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida.
The statement from Ghani's office also claimed that the Taliban demanded from Khalilzad the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan, but that there was also no agreement on that issue.
The statement added that Khalilzad has no authority to discuss issues such as a future Afghan administration but that his goal is to facilitate an intra-Afghan dialogue, meaning direct talks between the Taliban and Kabul.
Khalilzad had tweeted Saturday about progress in the talks in Qatar, where the insurgents have a political office, saying: "Meetings here were more productive than they have been in the past.
"We made significant progress on vital issues, he tweeted, without offering details.
Abdul Hakim Mujahid, a former Taliban official and currently a member of the High Peace Council, an independent body of clerics and respected Afghan figures, said he believes the Qatar talks resulted in a "good understanding between both sides but that more discussions are needed in the coming weeks or months.
"Afghanistan's problem is not so simple that it can be solved in a day, week or month, it needs more time and more discussions, Mujahid told The Associated Press.
The Taliban have in the past refused to negotiate directly with Kabul - a standing that does not appear to have changed. They have maintained that they are prepared to talk with U.S. officials only and only about the pullout of foreign forces from Afghanistan.
Afghan political analyst Waheed Muzhda says he believes that Khalilzad and the Taliban have reached agreement on both the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and a cease-fire deal, but that neither side is prepared to say so at this point.
"But peace talks are not possible unless both sides first agree on a cease-fire, Muzhda said.
In Monday's address to the nation, Ghani also stressed that U.S. and other foreign forces are in Afghanistan because they are needed here and that if there is to be any downsizing or pullout, the Kabul government will have to play a role in the talks.
Ghani also reiterated his call on the Taliban to engage "in direct talks with the Afghan government.

Texto completo: There once was a rule of journalistic ethics that a “straight news” reporter refrained from gratuitous labels and judgments pertaining to the subjects of their stories. The New York Times clearly has forgotten those journalistic ethics.

Witness Saturday’s opinion column masquerading as a news report about a meeting Virginia Thomas, wife of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, and other conservative activists had with President Trump. The sneering contempt of the reporters for Mrs. Thomas — and their obvious desire to convince the readers that Mrs. Thomas is bad, bad, bad, bad I tell you, BAD! — is like something out of the left-wing the Nation magazine, rather than a major daily newspaper.

Note the words I’ve Italicized in this summary: The lead sentence of the story calls Mrs. Thomas’ group “a delegation of hard- right activists.” The fourth paragraph says that “Ms. Thomas has long been close to what had been the Republican Party’s fringes .” Later, reporters Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni accuse Mrs. Thomas of “promoting conspiracy theories,” and repeatedly report that she has been “criticized” for “inappropriate” potential “conflicts of interest,” “provoking controversy,” and hiring people thought to be racists.

At least the reporters had the courtesy to say what the supposed conspiracy theories were. Both are hardly crazy theories. One was that billionaire “ philanthropist ” George Soros was working against Trump. Memo to the Times: He was and is. The other was the “Democrats had committed voter fraud during last year’s midterm elections.” Some of them certainly appeared to do so.

Anyway, throughout the whole story, there is nary a kind word said about Mrs. Thomas, while paragraph after paragraph details her supposed flaws — and those of some of the other conservatives who met with Trump last week.

As a matter of fact, it's not even clear how hard the Times worked to try to verify its reporting with those not obviously hostile to the conservative activists in the meeting.

The Times reports that Mrs. Thomas herself “did not respond to an email seeking comment,” but did not say whether it tried to get comments from any others brought to the meeting by Mrs. Thomas.

The Times article identifies Mrs. Thomas with regard to her husband’s position and to her own chairmanship of an umbrella group of conservative activists — but does nothing else to describe her as a person of substance in her own right, one who was once a top aide to then-House Majority Leader Dick Armey in the 1990s.

For the liberal media, women are never to be belittled by identifying them primarily as their husband’s wives, unless of course the woman is conservative.

But this is the same Maggie Haberman who blew the original reporting on the Covington Catholic boys at the March for Life, who came close to equating WikiLeaks with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, who treated Republican concern with obvious shenanigans in Florida vote-counting as “cold political calculation,” and who in general can be counted on to provide a liberal spin to almost any news story.

Maybe it’s time to describe some of the Times’ news articles as being on the “fringe” of journalism.

Anthony Davis requests a trade from New Orleans, giving the Lakers an opportunity

Texto completo: For the last month and a half, no one has been discussed more as the Lakers’ mythical second superstar as much as Anthony Davis.
As of Monday morning, that pipe dream seems a little closer to reality.
ESPN reported that the 6-foot-10, five-time All Star has officially requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans, where he’s spent the first seven seasons of his career. While the Pelicans would be able to offer Davis a supermax contract extension this summer with an estimated value of $240 million, Davis’ agent, Rich Paul, has said that he won’t sign an extension, preferring instead to compete for a championship.
With the 22-28 Pelicans now dealing with an unhappy superstar, the expectation is that the Lakers will attempt to muscle into the bidding before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. While ESPN reported that New Orleans does not want to deal Davis before the summer – when more suitors such as the Boston Celtics will be available – now is the Lakers’ best chance to land one of the best two-way players in the NBA.
Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who had sworn in front of Los Angeles media a month ago that New Orleans would not trade Davis, adopted a less rigid posture as he addressed reporters after practice on Monday morning.
“Obviously it’s in the open and everyone knows,” Gentry said. “For us, it’s business as usual.”
Davis has been named to the All-NBA first team three of the last four years. Averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocked shots this season, Davis will turn 26 in March. The dream of pairing a superstar entering his prime with LeBron James, who is still producing prime-level numbers, is an enticing one for the Lakers, who desire a return to the NBA’s biggest stage for the first time since 2010.
It was an earth-shaking announcement in New Orleans, where the Pelicans released an official statement confirming the report while saying they would make any given trade on their own timeline.
“Relative to specific talks of a trade, we will do this on our terms and our timeline,” the statement read. “One that makes the most sense for our team and it will not be dictated by those outside of our organization. We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction.”
Mention of tampering seems to carry a specific edge toward the Lakers: The organization has been fined twice for tampering under the Magic Johnson-led front office. The New York Times reported Monday afternoon that the NBA was investigating tampering concerns regarding Davis, though not specifc to any one team.
But that hasn’t stopped the speculation that Davis will one day be a Laker.
Some of the most hotly discussed trade assets the Lakers have are their own promising young players: Kyle Kuzma (19.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg); Lonzo Ball (9.9 ppg, 5.4 apg); and Brandon Ingram (16.6 ppg, 4.9 rpg). Kuzma is 23, while Ball and Ingram are 21. All are still on their rookie deals with the Lakers.
Other potential trade assets include 23-year-old guard Josh Hart (8.9 ppg, 4.1 rpg) and 21-year-old center Ivica Zubac (8.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg), who has been on the rise in recent weeks. The Lakers also control their first-round draft picks for the foreseeable future.
If the Lakers were to make a trade, they’d likely also have to include one of their higher-salary players to come close enough on Davis’ $25.4 million salary. Aside from James, some of the highest-paid Lakers included Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ($12 million, but with power to veto a trade) and Rajon Rondo ($9 million).
James has welcomed the idea of playing with Davis, a possibility he called “amazing” back in December. Paul also serves as James’ agent.
The implications of a trade for Davis also reached the Lakers’ practice Friday, but they appeared just as stoic. Ingram said trading for Davis would be “good for the Lakers, or whatever team that gets him,” but maintained that players have been shutting out the persistent trade rumors that the roster could be totally upheaved.
“It feels that (speculation is) on the outside of what’s in this gym,” he said at the team’s training facility. “I think you look on social networks and look on everything else, you have all these stories of this player, this player, this player. But no one in this room, or the players, or the coaches, or the general manager doesn’t say a word about it. … We only listen to the important people in this building.”
It’s worth noting that even though the Lakers’ core players are young, they’ve done plenty of cycles through the rumor mill near the trade deadline. Ball, Kuzma and Ingram were also widely discussed over the summer as possible assets in a deal with the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard, who later was traded to the Toronto Raptors.
Coach Luke Walton said he thinks his young players have shown a stronger ability to stay above the fray this January, even as trade rumors swirl more and more. He observed that Monday’s practice, which included James, was a focused session.
“There seems to be more comfort this time around than last year when all this was happening,” Walton said. “It’s just like anything in this league: their skill set, their bodies physically. The mental part of going through these types of things gets a little better every year it goes on. You go from being young to a vet and before you know it you don’t even think about this stuff.”
It’s unclear how much, if at all, Davis will play for the Pelicans before any deal is done. Teammate Jrue Holiday said he had no hard feelings toward Davis, whom he called “a professional.”
“Whatever decision he makes, I can’t be upset with him,” Holiday said. “I know this is a business, but he’s doing what’s best for him.”

Stephen King raises the dead

Texto completo: A man, upset that his local newspaper, the Portland Press Herald, was going to drop local, freelance reviews "of books about Maine, set in Maine, or written by Maine authors," tweeted his displeasure. The Portland Press Herald made a deal with him. If he could get 100 people to sign up for digital subscriptions, it would restore the coverage slated for cuts.
Less than 48 hours later, the Portland Press Herald had about 200 new digital subscriptions, and the newspaper promised to continue its coverage of Maine-related books.
It probably didn't hurt that the man who tweeted his displeasure has sold about a gabillion (estimated) books, has more than 5 million Twitter followers and is named Stephen King.
Lisa DeSisto, chief executive of the media company that owns the Portland Press Herald, told The New York Times it was a "Stephen King story with a happy ending."
A nice story with a happy ending, but these kinds of stories can make us forget the larger problem. Like just about every other newspaper in the country, the Portland Press Herald is subject to shrinking revenue and reduced budgets, and things that seem like extras -- like coverage of local books -- go by the wayside.
I'm sure loyal readers of the Biblioracle have noticed that when I first started this weekly bit of business, it was part of a stand-alone section dedicated entirely to books, featuring a robust serving of Chicago-centric content.
And now -- well, it isn't.
Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to still be here, and I do not envy the people who must make these decisions. But as a reader, above anything else, I'm in King's camp. I'm not interested in a world where every newspaper runs the same syndicated reviews of the same books. One of the greatest aspects of Bookworld -- the happy space I live within when I'm thinking about books -- is its diversity.
If a Chicago paper doesn't have the resources to cover Chicago books, are we going to trust New York and Washington to do it for us? Who is going to cover the book about the Chicago Cubs dynasty of 2016 to 2040 (a guy can dream)? How will we know about a book on the greatest skyline in the world if it's not covered by a Chicago paper? Even if out-of-towners do review our stories, what if they get them wrong?
I don't want our hearts to be too warmed by the story of Stephen King rallying the internet to save local book coverage in his hometown newspaper. I want us focused on the problem of even having to confront such a problem. There was a time when advertising covered newspapers' bottom lines, but those days are over. Subscriptions are the lifeblood.
More subscriptions, more stuff that readers want.
I am aware that I'm preaching to the choir here -- sort of like lectures I used to give to students in class about the importance of attendance -- but I'm at a loss. I don't have King's platform. If you are reading this and haven't subscribed, please do. If you're a subscriber and you value coverage of local books, let your voices be heard. And while you're doing that, consider a gift subscription for a friend, or just keep badgering your friend until he or she gives in and subscribes to get you to be quiet.
You know that Joni Mitchell song, "Big Yellow Taxi"?
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.
When I was a kid, I didn't understand what Ms. Mitchell was getting on about because I only knew the world as it was, not as it used to be. I'm older now, so I get it.
I don't want a world where young people don't know the books about the place they live.
How about you?

Book recommendations from the Biblioracle
John Warner tells you what to read based on the last five books you've read.

1. "The Heart's Invisible Furies" by John Boyne
2. "The Day the World Came to Town: 9/11 in Gander, Newfoundland" by Jim DeFede
3. "A Place for Us" by Fatima Farheen Mirza
4. "My Year of Rest and Relaxation" by Ottessa Moshfegh
5. "Lake Success" by Gary Shteyngart
-- Betsy G., Mount Prospect
I think Betsy may enjoy the humor and heart of John Hodgman's "Vacationland," a book about taking stock of the past and moving toward the future.

1. "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy
2. "Elevated" by Stephen King
3. "East of Eden" by John Steinbeck
4. "Dear Evan Hansen: The Novel" by Val Emmich with Steven Levenson, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul
5. "Bridge of Clay" by Markus Zusak
-- Melissa P., Dowagiac, Mich.
From her email, I can tell that Melissa is a librarian, which is an automatic move to the top of the request pile. The other thing people can do to up their odds is to make sure to include their hometown. I'm always anxious about recommending books to librarians, but of course that's part of the thrill: "Where'd You Go Bernadette" by Maria Semple.

1. "The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner" by Daniel Ellsberg
2. "Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece" by Michael Benson
3. "One Nation Under Gold: How One Precious Metal Has Dominated the American Imagination for Four Centuries" by James Ledbetter
4. "Annihilation: The Southern Reach Trilogy" by Jeff VanderMeer
5. "None of My Business" by P.J. O'Rourke
-- Bob. C., Chicago
I love the books that give the inside scoop, like the one above about "2001: A Space Odyssey." I suppose I like both the trivia as well as the sense that when I look at the art again, I know something about it others don't. This is a bit of a guess, and only works if Bob is a Monty Python fan, but here goes: "Diaries 1969-1979: The Python Years" by Michael Palin.

Texto completo: The major media have gone gaga over the number of women newly elected to Congress and those announcing their run for the White House in 2020, with more female candidates likely to follow suit.
But the media's bias - one of many - is revealed in their focus on mostly liberal women with barely a mention, if they are mentioned at all, of women who are conservative. Reporters, commentators and hosts on major networks, and including some cable outlets, speak of "women's issues," as if all women think, or should think, alike.
Worse, they never examine whether ideas floated by liberal women are anything new or whether they have worked in the past or are working presently. Many liberal pronouncements seem to be taken at face value, with little pushback to explain how they plan to make their proposals work, especially those that have been tried and failed before (consider programs to wipe out poverty, along with increased spending to improve public education, as just two of many examples).
Another example: the presidential candidacy announcement by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.
Harris has been in the Senate for only two years but already she hears "Hail to the Chief" playing for her? Who does she think she is, Barack Obama?
In predictable liberal fashion, Harris wants to impose a $3 trillion tax plan on the country at a time when, according to Investor's Business Daily, "President Trump's $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could kick economic growth into high gear."
Harris also tracks with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in promoting Medicare for all that is projected to cost $30 trillion. With a national debt at nearly $22 trillion and soaring, the idea that we could absorb additional debt is a recipe for bankruptcy, especially when one considers that many initial cost estimates for past government programs have far exceeded projections.
Federal tax revenues have already hit record highs. The obvious problem is not insufficient revenue; rather, it is lack of spending discipline and the desire to give people whatever they want, hoping a growing addiction to government will produce more votes for the politicians dispensing "free" goodies.
Back to media's fixation: Why do major media outlets trumpet the causes of women, gays, African-Americans, Hispanics and other groups who are liberal?
Why do the ideas of conservative women never seem to receive that same level of attention? If you have to ask the question you haven't been paying attention.
It seems the major media long ago abandoned fairness, balance, even accuracy.
Especially in the Trump era, they have displayed naked ideological cheerleading for liberals and their proposals. Any fair examination of major newspapers - from the front page, to the editorial and op-ed pages - proves the point. It has become much easier to speed read The Washington Post and The New York Times, because every day they contain little else but a steady drumbeat of anti-Trump stories, editorials and columns.
The conservative Media Research Center has calculated that 90 percent of TV coverage of the first two years of the Trump administration has been negative.
Whatever one's views, this is not healthy for the credibility and stability of journalism, the political parties or the country.
Yes, there are far fewer Republican women in Congress than female Democrats, but that is not an invitation to focus solely on the Democrats while ignoring Republican - and especially conservative Republican - women.
Their ideas and proposals deserve at least equal consideration and examination.

HE'S FROM LONGUYYLAND!

Texto completo: Kenny Atkinson's Nets players are comfortable enough with the boss that they are not above teasing him, especially about the way he sounds, and especially when he is yelling at them.
"The players all the time make fun of my Long Island accent," the coach of one of the NBA's most surprising teams said after practice on Tuesday. "I'll say something and the players, they mimic me, they mock me, which is pretty funny.
"I think that shows [they think], 'Hey, this guy is from here. He's got the accent and everything.' Pretty cool."
That might seem a trivial part of the job requirements for a New York coach. But Atkinson, 51, who grew up in Northport and played at St. Anthony's High School, believes it is a significant help that he has known the turf since birth.
That includes everything from how he deals with players, fans and journalists, to the support of nearby family to simply navigating day-to-day life in a region many non-natives find intimidating.
"I'm not sure I get this job, first of all, without my New York roots," said Atkinson, a Knicks assistant from 2008-12. "That might be underselling myself, but I think it really helped me in terms of getting the job. And I absolutely think it's a huge advantage."
Atkinson believes "the players themselves like that you kind of know the area and know the history and know the market . . . I do think it gives you credibility with the players. They know you kind of know the whole deal here."
But the benefits extend well beyond that.
"It just makes me a lot more comfortable," he said. "Everybody [around the league] is like, 'Oh my gosh, you got a job in New York?' I can imagine another coach having to [adjust], but I've been around it my whole life.
"We subscribed to Newsday and The New York Times, so I grew up reading the papers. I grew up watching all New York sports and I'm all over sports radio, too, so I know all the personalities and all the players and all the reporters.
"I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable in another market, if I was in Chicago or something, because there is not that connection."
Atkinson has fully embraced Brooklyn. He lives in Cobble Hill, walks to games at Barclays Center and sometimes walks or bikes to the Nets' practice facility in Industry City.
"I wanted to, but I also thought that was the right thing to do," he said. "If you're going to coach in Brooklyn you should live there. And also it's close to my family. I can go right out to Long Island, where my whole family lives."
Walking everywhere means interacting with fans everywhere, and Atkinson is all for it, especially now that after two losing seasons the Nets are legitimate playoff contenders.
Still, Atkinson - the only current coach/manager among the nine New York-area major pro teams who grew up around here - has a long way to go to match some predecessors.
The list includes some of the biggest names in their franchises' histories - Joe Torre, Bill Parcells, Red Holzman - but over the decades others have flopped, such as Rich Kotite.
Newsday ranked the top 10, with some ground rules: Pro achievements only. (Sorry Nat Holman and Lou Carnesecca.) Immediate metro area only, as defined by high school attended. (Sorry upstaters John McGraw, Jeff Van Gundy, Pat Riley and Tom Coughlin.)
Perhaps someday Atkinson will be on the good list himself. For now, he endorses the idea of it. "I could be wrong about this," he said, "but I do think there's an appreciation for coaches here."
As long as they win, yes.
NEW YORK STATE OF MIND
Our top 10 New York pro coaches who attended a high school in the immediate New York City vicinity.
1. JOE TORRE, YANKEES
St. Francis Prep (Brooklyn)
Yes, Torre managed the Mets, too, without much success, from 1977-81. But that is not what landed him atop this list. Four World Series titles with the Yankees did. And six American League pennants. And 10 AL East titles. All in only a dozen seasons.
2. BILL PARCELLS, GIANTS
River Dell High School (Oradell, N.J.)
Being a gruff "Jersey Guy" was part of Parcells' image, but so was winning. He led the 1986 and '90 Giants to Super Bowl victories, lifting the franchise out of two dark decades. Then it took him only two years to get the Jets to an AFC title game.
3. RED HOLZMAN, KNICKS
Franklin K. Lane High School (Brooklyn)
Holzman led the Knicks to their first championship in 1970, then another in '73. They still await a third. A standout player who won an NBA title as a Royal in 1951, he later was a scout before winning big with a much-loved style of team ball.
4. KEVIN LOUGHERY, NETS
Cardinal Hayes High School (Bronx)
The Nets never have won an NBA championship, but they did win two on Long Island in the ABA coached by Loughery, in 1974 and '76. It did not hurt that starting with the first of those seasons Roosevelt's own Julius Erving arrived to help the cause.
5, ALLIE SHERMAN, GIANTS
Boys High School (Brooklyn)
To recall Sherman for the "Goodbye, Allie" chants near the end of his term does not do him justice. He was NFL Coach of the Year in his first two seasons, 1961 and '62, and took the Giants to three consecutive NFL title games, losing them all.
6. BOBBY VALENTINE, METS
Rippowam High School (Stamford, Conn.)
In six-plus seasons, there rarely was a dull moment with Valentine, including playoffs in 1999 and 2000, the latter ending with an NL pennant and a Subway Series loss to the Yankees. His work after the 9/11 attacks might be his greatest legacy.
7. JOE LAPCHICK, KNICKS
No high school (Yonkers)
Most sports fans recall Lapchick more for his years at St. John's, but he spent a decade with the Knicks, from 1947-56, during a formative time for the franchise and NBA. He also won, taking the Knicks to NBA Finals in 1951, '52 and '53.
8. WILLIE RANDOLPH, METS
Tilden High School (Brooklyn)
The Randolph Era lasted only 3 ½ seasons and is recalled for falling one game short of a World Series in 2006 and an epic late collapse in 2007. But get this: Randolph's .544 winning percentage is second only in Mets history to Davey Johnson's .588.
9. RICK PITINO, KNICKS
St. Dominic High School (Oyster Bay)
While it is true Pitino had a tad more success in college than the pros, his brief time with the Knicks had its moments. He took over a 24-win team, won 38 games his first season and 52 in his second - their highest total between 1973 and '93.
10. RICHIE ADUBATO, LIBERTY
East Orange High School (East Orange, N.J.)
The WNBA was only two years old when Adubato took over the Liberty in 1999, and he quickly developed a knack for the league, reaching three WNBA Finals in his first four seasons, during which the Liberty thrice finished first in the Eas

On the Soapbox of Couture

Texto completo: PARIS -- In 1996 André Leon Talley, then a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and famously often the only black man in the front row of fashion shows, organized a shoot for the magazine entitled "Scarlett 'n the Hood" that reimagined "Gone With the Wind" with the races reversed. Naomi Campbell, then one of the few black supermodels, played Scarlett; John Galliano, then at Givenchy, played a maid.
"We wanted to temporarily turn the pages of history around," Mr. Talley told The New York Times afterward. On Wednesday in Paris, not quite 23 years later, Pierpaolo Piccioli, the creative director of Valentino, echoed his words.
"When it started, couture was made for white women," Mr. Piccioli said, standing before a mood board pinned with photographs of versions of the black Madonna, works by the artist Kerry James Marshall and the famous 1948 Cecil Beaton shoot for Vogue with nine white models in Charles James couture gowns, surrounded by photos from Ebony and Franca Sozzani's 2008 Black Issue of Italian Vogue.
"What if they had been in there?" he went on, gesturing to the Ebony women and Beaton. "To me couture is about dream and fantasy and the expression of individuality, and that means diversity. It's not about a political message you put on a T-shirt, and it's not about street wear or sportswear. It's about how you look at the world."
Then Mr. Piccioli showed everyone how to look. He did it with his now-signature combination of lavish ease and a garden of painterly shades; his ability to toss a cropped neon yellow cashmere cape atop a blush vest and nude trousers so its train trailed on the floor just so. He did it with elaborate embroideries in lace and sequins worn with the insouciance of a T-shirt, and filmy floral organzas sliced up the sides to reveal lace bodysuits and pants underneath (complete with pockets).
And he did it with 65 models, 45 of whom were black, all in outfits christened by the women who worked on them. In an industry that has lately made real strides toward acknowledging and rethinking its own past failings in regards to the definition of beauty, it made a statement that was impossible to ignore.
"As a designer, I have a voice," Mr. Piccioli said. "Hopefully a loud one. I want to use it."
He wasn't the only one. Couture may be an elite sector of expensive clothes for the very few, but its reach goes far beyond its customer base, and last week designers were using it to get a variety of different messages out.
This is a time when people are speaking up all over. To think that fashion, designed to reflect the moment, should sit it out is deluded. But it is not always an easy fit.
Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren of Viktor & Rolf, for example, decided to make a double entendre of the whole idea (wink-wink, nudge-nudge). They appliquéd coffee-cup one-liners onto candy-colored ruffled mille-feuilles made from a total of eight kilometers of tulle to suggest that no matter how sweet a woman looked, it was time to wake up to her reality.
"I'm not shy -- I just don't like you," read the big block letters on one enormous white baby-doll gown. "Sorry I'm late -- I didn't want to come," went the words on another. "Get Mean" appeared on a pink heart amid valentine red; and "Give a Damn" appeared on an angelic nightie.
It was catchy, as their fashion jokes usually are, if not particularly subtle, unlike Maria Grazia Chiuri's feminist thematics at Dior, expressed in the all-female acrobatic troupe Mimbre.
The performers stacked themselves into various newfangled kinds of human pyramids under the big top built in the gardens of the Rodin Museum, balanced on each other's shoulders, reaching ever higher. Beneath them came models in circus-inspired crystal-spangled bloomers and red and black polka-dot corset playsuits; harlequin ruffs and beaded bareback rider dresses.
If the clothes ultimately didn't seem to have much to do with the show of female power, except maybe for a troika of pleated Jean Harlow lamé gowns -- the sort that used to make viewers go weak at the knees -- the fact that this time around her feminism was implied rather than advertised on T-shirts and posters was a step forward. Besides, the ringmaster was a woman: in slick cut tails and a ruffled sheer white blouse. So was the lion tamer. Ms. Chiuri made her point.
As did John Galliano at Maison Margiela Artisanal, with his chaotic mélange of graffiti and jacquard and computer-generated prints and metallic threads and feathers and tweed and satin and leather and felted flowers and faux fur, all of it chopped and changed and morphed together into not entirely identifiable garments and shown on an interchangeable array of male and female models.
We are in a situation, he said in a podcast, of "overconsumption, oversaturation, overstimulation, overindulgence." You know: the social media sickness -- so he embraced it. Then he pared it all down.
It's one way to propose a treatise on technology. Iris van Herpen, in her lovely multilayered organza examination of man and machine and the coming Singularity, offered another. They were looking forward, anyway, as was Clare Waight Keller at Givenchy, who is proving adept at taking the classic tropes of couture -- this time the whole idea of black tie -- and subverting them.
So black latex leggings were worn instead of pants under exactingly cut jackets with a single knife-sharp white lapel and blood-red second-skin latex undershirts below black lace halter-neck ball gowns.
There were black guipure bodysuits peeking through white guipure baby-doll dresses; steroid-fueled bows sprouting backpacks at the core; and egg-yolk-yellow leggings oozing out beneath delicate white flowered evening skirts.
They dared you to re-examine old value systems, and in doing so had an air of currency absent from the high-low taffeta and tulle confections at Giambattista Valli, the cosmic floral fantasies at Schiaparelli and the 86 meditations on red and blue at Armani Privé (O.K., plus a little silver and black), where waiting for another color was like waiting for Godot.
They doth protest not at all. Nor did the Chanel garden constructed in the Grand Palais with expansive grass, palm and orange trees, rose bushes (and a swimming pool), a delightful frame for the long, lean silhouettes in springtime pastels; garden party frocks in organza with feathered blooms; and satin pouf skirts and bouclé bolero tops folded and flipped inside out. But such escapism is not really enough anymore. It's an old story.
Still, none of them had the last word. That belonged to Olivier Rousteing at Balmain, whose debut couture was the last major show of the season. Once upon a time Balmain was a stalwart name on the schedule, but it closed its atelier in 2002 when Oscar de la Renta left. This year Mr. Rousteing decided it was time to bring couture back, and there was some anticipation about what that could mean.
Answer: bulbous leather "pearls" that encircled a model's thighs and shoulders. Jutting hip buttresses that stuck out from the side under enormous pink bows. Shredded "denim" dangling silver fringe and embroidered with crystals and pearls (there were more than a million pieces of Swarovski decoration used in all). Pastel prints in faded graffiti swirls pleated into face-obscuring fans.
A simple long white coat. Two topless models, one in a frilled ball skirt, one in white sweats. with a giant silver belt. An effort to, seemingly, go through the motions of the old couture -- in a written note, Mr. Rousteing said he had "pored through the house's archives" -- without trying to synthesize the point of the new.
He said in his note that doing the collection had allowed him "the immense luxury of stepping back" from the pressures of the regular grind; that he and his team learned new techniques and innovations they can apply in the rest of their year. Fair enough. But what he didn't say -- and this is the problem -- was what it was supposed to mean for the women who would buy it, or even look at it.
As a result, instead of a soapbox, it felt like an echo chamber.

Texto completo: On paper, the six-day strike teachers strike that disrupted learning at 900 public schools across Los Angeles was a fight about orthodox demands like lower class sizes, higher pay and more support staff from nurses to librarians and counselors.
But a core issue and perhaps the most divisive barely touched the bargaining table: the future of the city’s 224 charter schools.
Education policy experts contend that although United Teachers Los Angeles – the union that represents the teachers in L.A. Unified – wins regarding charter schools at the strike’s conclusion may be largely symbolic, the strike has sparked a broader conversation happening across Southern California on charters that will likely make its way to Sacramento and stands to impact the direction of public school districts across the state.
Public education is essentially a two-sector system codified into state law in 1992 – the traditional, centrally managed school district and charter schools independent from a central school board.
As enrollment in the Los Angeles school district declined for 15 years, charter schools grew into a full-fledged industry educating more than 112,000 students and posing tough competition for traditional public schools.
Angeleno enrollment in charters, which are publicly funded but privately managed, reportedly drains $600 million a year from the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is tasked with serving around half a million students. While the schools do undergo a rigorous approval process complimented by hundreds of pages of paperwork, they operate free from many regulations and all but a few are nonunion.
To clear up any confusion about district-affiliated versus independent charters, a district-affiliated charter is a hybrid. The word “charter” in its name reflects a status the school adopted to secure more outside sources of revenue but it operates within the confines of the district.
During the strike
In the months leading up to and during the six-day walkout, UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl frequently decried “the unregulated growth of charter schools” to the press and his own membership.
“That doesn’t mean all charter schools are bad,” he repeated in his characteristic baritone, rather what began as a well-intentioned experiment now undermines traditional public schooling as more charter schools backed by billionaires and neglect the neediest students.
Charter school advocates call the union’s messaging on charters during the strike a blatant mischaracterization.
“I’d really like Alex Caputo-Pearl to come to the schools I run,” said Gloria Romero, the executive director of Scholarship Prep Charter School in Santa Ana and a former California state senator who while representing the San Gabriel Valley and East Los Angeles served as chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee.
“We’re closing the achievement gap for children who are English language learners and special education, if anything. There are some great schools in L.A. Unified but there are too many pockets where schools are chronically underperforming.”
John Rogers, director of the UCLA’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, warned of sometimes superficial narratives surrounding charter schools.
“I think there are a number of somewhat simplistic analyses that don’t capture the full picture,” he said. “Many charter schools enroll large numbers of low-income students and students of color and we shouldn’t forget that fact.”
That said, charter advocates have in recent years poured millions into political campaigns, including in Los Angeles, where billionaire and charter supporter Eli Broad spent almost $10 million in 2017 along with allies in an effort that won a majority on the LAUSD Board of Education.
The charter sector, according to Rogers, is “a mix of some amazing educators who have worked within district bureaucracies and got frustrated and wanted in their words more freedom, some wealthy people who wanted to do good and felt like their money wasn’t going to be spent well in the district, and then some with ties to right wing think tanks and organizations who are deeply committed to undercutting the power of unions as kind of a bulwark of the democratic party.”
He added that it is rare for charters to admit students with the most substantial special needs, but that’s mostly backed up only by anecdotal evidence.
In the agreement
The main appearance of charter schools in the 40-page agreement reached between UTLA and LAUSD this Tuesday is a provision calling for more community input in cases of potential co-location, when a charter school moves into either occupied or un-occupied space on the campus of a traditional public school.
The still-temporary deal must be ratified by the School Board in a meeting slated for Jan. 29.
“The district has to inform us in December about any schools that are targeted for co-location,” said Caputo-Pearl on KPCC’s AirTalk Wednesday. “That gives time for respectful notice to parents … and certainly parents can ask questions and teachers can push back.”
As a side-bargain, UTLA also said the school board agreed to vote this month on a resolution that calls for Gov. Newsom to enact a cap on new charter schools at LAUSD while the state further studies the issue. If approved, the resolution would be a call for more state action on public charter schools.
Yet “it remains to be seen” whether the measures become more than a symbolic win for the union, said author of a book on California politics and New York Times opinion writer Miriam Pawel.
One out of every three independent charter schools in Los Angeles is co-located. While the arrangements are mutually beneficial, many complain of discord as entirely separate schools attempt to share everything from libraries to cafeterias and playgrounds.
“Co-location seemed to be a significant step for the union potentially. But the district doesn’t have has much leeway, so I think those are issues that will have to be addressed at the state level, and there’s definitely some interest in addressing it in Sacramento.”
Looking ahead
What all parties appear to agree on is that the teachers strike drew attention from the Inland Empire to L.A. to the befallen state of traditional public education in the second-largest school system in the nation, but that the future of charters can only be determined in halls of the state capital.
“The strike opened the conversation about how the broader public can begin to develop rules and regulations through the legislative process,” said Rogers, “purposeful planning of how we bring on new charter schools, how we reauthorize charter schools, how we think about the location of charter schools.”
And charter leaders like Gloria Romero are prepared to make a case.
“I look forward to sitting at that table testifying before former colleagues and new folks to say hey forget about the campaign contributions that you got from CTA (California Teachers Association) and let’s think about what this means in terms of student achievement,” she said.
“The fact that charters are thought to be so dangerous, that’s a product of their success and that’s what I hope a fair hearing in Sacramento would find.”

Warren's wealth tax proposal could alter how Democrats talk about economic inequality

Texto completo: Democrats have campaigned for decades on the need to address income inequality and raise taxes on the rich, but a new proposal from Massachusetts US Senator Elizabeth Warren could change the terms of the debate.
On Thursday, Warren's campaign began rolling out her “Ultra Millionaire" tax proposal, which would target wealth instead of income. Her plan, developed by professors at the University of California, Berkeley, proposes taxing 2 percent of a person's assets above $50 million and 3 percent of assets above $1 billion. They estimate it would raise approximately $2.75 trillion over 10 years.
Contrast that to how Democrats talked about taxes and the rich just a dozen years ago. In 2007, as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton visited Iowa and New Hampshire, they were talking about letting Bush-era income tax cuts expire for those in the highest tax brackets and going after corporate tax loopholes. And, while John Edwards talked about the “two Americas" in that campaign, many of his solutions called for aiding those with lower incomes, not raising taxes on the rich.
In recent weeks, newly elected progressive politicians like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have forced a national discussion on dramatically hiking income taxes for the wealthy. The rising Democratic star has called for a 70 percent marginal rate on income above $10 million. But as tax experts and academics point out, income tax changes do nothing to address capital gains, corporate income, and other ways truly rich people amass their money.
“Senator Warren's idea to tax wealth can dramatically broaden the national discussion about how to address inequality," said Christian Weller, a UMass Boston professor and a national expert on wealth inequality. He said a focus on wealth could force a conversation on other issues, such as structural racism, disparate educational opportunities, and declining social mobility.
He noted that studies have shown a majority of Americans could not go without two paychecks because they don't have a big enough emergency fund.
The pitch fits perfectly into how Warren is presenting herself as a candidate in the weeks after she formed her presidential exploratory committee. Warren believes the federal government has been corrupted by the wealthy. Taxing wealth could be a way of reining the rich in.
Whether a wealth tax proposal will help or hurt Warren's chances of winning the Democratic presidential nomination remains to be seen. But even in first-in-the-nation primary state New Hampshire, known for its lack of broad-based taxes, the issue could resonate with liberal audiences.
Former New Hampshire state senator Jackie Cilley is an outspoken progressive who also teaches at the University of New Hampshire's business school. She said Warren's discussion of a wealth tax will further highlight inequality as a key issue in the upcoming primary and may force other candidates to come up with their own solutions.
“We are already seeing a series of people coming forward with serious proposals on how we shrink the inequality gap and the fairest way to do that," Cilley said. “With this idea, she is adding to the debate, and I think people here will want to hear it."

For Many Workers, It's Not Quite Over Yet

Texto completo: Some cried with relief. Their 35-day nightmare of missing bill payments, working without paychecks, asking strangers for money and visiting food pantries was finally ending.
But many of the federal workers who have been furloughed or working for free since December were leery of the three-week deal reached on Friday to reopen the government. New worries gnawed: How long before they got paid? Would federal contractors see even a dime of back pay?
And most of all, after the longest shutdown in American history, would they and 800,000 other federal workers be back in the same mess in three weeks if President Trump and Democrats do not reach an accord on whether to fund his proposed border wall?
"This was all for nothing, basically," said Angela Kelley, 51, a furloughed worker for the Bureau of Land Management in Milwaukee who picked up shifts as an Uber driver to earn money to buy gas and groceries as the shutdown dragged on.
On Friday, Mr. Trump praised federal workers as "fantastic people" and "incredible patriots" and acknowledged the toll they had suffered. But several federal employees said they still felt angry after being treated like pawns, they said, in a five-week-long Washington standoff. They said the shutdown had left deep scars on their families and finances and undermined their faith in elected leaders, and in the careers they had chosen.
The New York Times talked with more than a dozen federal workers and contractors -- from wildland firefighters to Coast Guard families to museum security guards -- about how they had survived the shutdown, and the uncertainty they now face.
'They Chose to Break Faith'
John Hare, 42, is one of thousands of Coast Guard employees and retirees worried that they may find themselves in the same precarious position a few weeks from now.
Because the Coast Guard is the only branch of the military that is part of the Department of Homeland Security, it was affected by the shutdown. About 55,000 active-duty, reserve and civilian employees had already missed either one or two paychecks, while another 50,000 military retirees would have gone without a pension payment for the first time on Feb. 1.
After 22 years of service, Mr. Hare was forced to retire from the Coast Guard last August after learning he had a rare form of cancer that spread from his appendix. His wife had to stop working to care for him, and missing Mr. Hare's pension check of $2,698 would have put a significant dent into the family budget.
"The faith in our leadership to be able to negotiate with each other has been broken," Mr. Hare, of Rolesville, N.C., said on Friday. "And they chose to break faith with the U.S. military."
"I certainly question the hostage-taking of government employees' paychecks," he said. "And nobody that was in power who had the power to stop this, none of them were injured" by the shutdown.
"It is less a sense of relief because nothing has been solved."
'This Has Damaged My Family'
Yvette Hicks, 40, a security guard at the Smithsonian museums, said she woke up on Friday and prayed, once again, for the shutdown to end. As a single mother, she said the shutdown had taken a toll on her family's budget and her own mental health.
When she learned on Friday she might be returning to work, Ms. Hicks said she had been crying. Her 14-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son were due home from school soon, and she was trying to put up a brave face for them. She said her son, Kaden, had nevertheless told his teachers that his mother was now sad all the time.
Ms. Hicks said her family had once been homeless, and that she believed her job at the Smithsonian was a path to stability. She even saved up enough to book a spring-break vacation for her children to an indoor water park in Virginia. But as the bills piled up and her paychecks stopped, she said she canceled the trip and lost the $350 deposit she had paid for a room.
"It's just a hurting thing," she said. "This has damaged my family."
'Our Country Is Being Run by Children'
Anthony Powers, 35, had begun thinking about leaving his 15-year career as part of an elite team of wildland firefighters with the United States Forest Service in Southern California. He was that frustrated with his nation's leaders.
"Our country is being run by children," he said.
On Friday, he was relieved but not elated, noting that everything could shut down again soon.
Mr. Powers and his colleagues typically spend this time of year clearing away brush to help lessen fire danger in the coming year. None of that has been happening for the last month or so, and his team needs more than three weeks to get the job done. He also has a national conference set for the end of February, and the short-term opening leaves him in limbo. Is it going to happen? Should he plan for it? Not plan for it?
"There's been so much planning for this to go into the long-term," he said. "Now it's like, where do you reset?"
'So Out of Touch With the American People'
Nic Trujillo, 34, a single father and collections representative for the Internal Revenue Service in Ogden, Utah, said the shutdown had done financial and emotional damage.
He had not paid rent in January because he needed to pay other expenses. On Friday, he and his 6-year-old son were just one week away from being evicted and having to move in with extended family.
Staying at home had also left him depressed. Before he was ordered to return to work without pay on Jan. 18, his natural night-owl tendencies had taken over. He would stay up late, get up to get his son off to school, then sleep for much of the day.
"I haven't really done anything. I haven't really gone anywhere," he said, explaining that he didn't want to waste gas. "It's just been a very depressive time."
He said he blamed both the president and Congress for the shutdown, saying that none of them knew what it was like to live paycheck to paycheck.
"They are so out of touch with the American people that it's unacceptable."
'I'm Staying in Shutdown Mode'
Kim Howell, 34, whose husband is in the Coast Guard in Boston and has been working 12-hour night shifts throughout the shutdown, said she didn't feel much relief on Friday. She said she didn't expect that her husband would get any back pay for a week or two. And then there was the possibility that the government would shut down again in three weeks.
Ms. Howell said her family had been fortunate because she works for a tech startup. But the loss of her husband's income strained them. They had to put off rent payments, utility bills, and cellphone, cable and internet bills.
She had visited a food pantry that had been set up in Boston for Coast Guard families. She worried about the impact on her three children, who are 9, 13 and 14. Her oldest child told her he felt helpless and anxious watching his parents try to navigate the crisis. She did not blame any particular party, but said she felt betrayed. And she worried the dysfunction was far from over.
"I'm staying in shutdown mode," she said. "That's the only responsible thing to do right now."

Texto completo: When Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone was arrested by FBI agents at his Florida home Friday, a flood of new information emerged about Stone's activities during the 2016 presidential election.
Much of what was laid out in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's indictment about Stone's communication with WikiLeaks already was known, often through public statements made by Stone himself. But the indictment offers new details on the steps Stone allegedly took to conceal his involvement.
Here's what we learned from the indictment on Friday.
Stone bragged about his involvement with WikiLeaks, then backtracked First, some background: In August of 2016, Stone claimed publicly during a Republican Party event in Florida that he had “communicated" with Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks. Stone also made a number of other previously reported statements to the Trump campaign predicting the release of hacked e-mails from Hillary Clinton.
Mueller's indictment alleges that after the House, Senate, and Special Counsel's office began investigating possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia, Stone took steps to conceal his involvement with WikiLeaks, including through threats to radio show host Randy Credico, who was allegedly acting as an intermediary between Stone and WikiLeaks.
Mueller alleges Stone tried to pressure his WikiLeaks connection not to testify The witness tampering charge includes the content of text messages and other communications between and Stone and Credico, who hosted Assange on his show in 2016. According to the indictment and the conversations between the two men, Stone's version, given under oath, was false, Credico wrote to Stone, according to court papers.
“During these conversations, STONE repeatedly made statements intended to prevent Person 2 from cooperating with the investigations," prosecutors allege. Credico is identified only as “Person 2" in court papers, but dates in the indictment match when Assange appeared on his radio show.
Mueller alleges Credico urged Stone to come clean According to the indictment, once federal investigators had developed information that contradicted Stone's testimony, especially about how Stone described Credico's connection to Assange, Credico repeatedly urged Stone to tell the truth.
“You should be honest w fbi . . . there was no back channel . . . be honest," Credico wrote. “You need to amend your testimony before I testify" to Congress.
But Stone refused, and instead urged Credico to remain silent beginning in November 2017 and continuing in the months that followed, prosecutors allege.
Stone allegedly invoked the Godfather and threatened to take away Credico's dog Stone urged Credico to 'Stonewall it. Plead the fifth. Anything to save the plan' . . . Richard Nixon."
Stone worked for Nixon's 1972 campaign and the executive branch during his administration.
Stone also reminded Credico about “Frank Pentangeli," a character from the Mafia movie, “The Godfather Part II," who perjures himself before a congressional committee, prosecutors allege.
Credico insisted, however, that it was up to Stone to act, and to finally tell the truth. And last April, Stone's tone turned harsh, denouncing Credico as a “stoolie" who should be “prepared to die."
“You are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds," he allegedly texted Credico April 9. “I am so ready. Let's get to it. Prepare to die [expletive.]"
Stone also threatened to dognap Credico's canine, vowing “to take that dog away from you.'
In reply Credico's tone also sharpened toward Stone. “You should have just been honest with the house Intel committee . . . you've opened yourself up to perjury charges like an idiot," he wrote.
Stone said he couldn't take the Fifth — and cited his relationship to Trump Stone also seemed to suggest to Credico that he could not invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because of his strong connection to Trump. “If you testify you're a fool. Because of tromp [sic] I could never get away with a certain [sic] my Fifth Amendment rights but you can," Stone wrote. “ I guarantee you you are the one who gets indicted for perjury if you're stupid enough to testify."
Credico, according to the indictment, did assert his Fifth Amendment right when called before a congressional committee in December 2017. Credico currently is not facing any charges.

Texto completo: It’s over. After 12 years of daily contact, I am finished with Facebook. It's not easy. We had a long meaningful connection — my avatar had more than 1200 virtual friends from every stage of my life.
Thousands of tiny takes and status updates from two-dimensional acquaintances had nearly replaced physical, personal contact. And those digital updates, links and images carried surprising emotional value. For instance, though my mother died four years ago at 90, I’ve still wished her happy birthday each year on her dormant Facebook page.
I was an enthusiastic early adapter. I joined in early 2006, when there were fewer than 12 million members. So intriguing was the prospect of a world wide Rolodex, I forged an email address with an . edu suffix in order to qualify.

Covington Catholic furor is a warning to end our dangerous social media mob mentality
Your photoshopped, Insta-perfect life is a fake — here's the key to make it a little more real
I deleted my Twitter account. It's a breeding ground for thoughtlessness and contempt.
Though well into my 50’s when Mark Zuckerberg launched his online club, I considered myself internet literate. I wrote for an online magazine, comfortably searched on Google, banked online and bought bargains on eBay. I used email daily and instant messaged my children.
Online becomes real life
But Facebook, guiding my idea of friendship from analog affection to digital distraction, became my entry into social media. Before joining, friendship had been an analog connection, exclusively three-dimensional, and suddenly it was accessible through another, limitless portal.
Social scientist Robin Dunbar holds that humans have a social connection capacity of roughly 150 individuals — (although I doubt marketing algorithms drive his research). But, in the beginning of Facebook, there were literally millions of additional friends to choose from.
In real life, I know when I’ve been unfriended and feel sadness with such a loss. But, recognizing the difference between human and avatar, I’d hardly notice falling off with a fair-weather Facebook friend.
My timeline was stacked with my Generation X, millennial colleagues and some childhood friends of my grown-up children. In the days before everyone had a Twitter game, The New York Times Magazine had an item about the most entertaining status updates on Facebook. A week or two later, one of these cyber celebrities requested my friendship. Flattered, I readily accepted, years before I learned the meaning of "FOMO. "
I searched for a few familiar names from high school but my new virtual companions skewed much younger. Around 2008 a person whose name I didn’t recognize reached across the decades to befriend me. His profile showed he attended my high school class of 1967 and my memory conjured a shy boy among the coat locker-lined hallways, just outside of my field of vision.
With the mental image of him came a sharp, unpleasant recollection of my own adolescent judging. A little shaken that my history had so abruptly caught up with me, I messaged my former classmate, apologizing for the callow, dismissive teenager I had been. He replied graciously, feigning ignorance of my prehistoric microaggression. Unfortunately, though my social skills had improved since my teenage years, my digital interface abilities were still subpar. I slighted him again by accidentally deleting his friend request.
Meantime, I cyber-gifted virtual cupcakes, posted videos, and quoted song lyrics to my new pixilated pals. I wrote often on Slate, Aol and the Washington Post about Facebook’s college-age founder’s controversies and public presence. I was solidly team Zuckerberg when Aaron Sorkin’s film "The Social Network" was released in 2010. Although I was skeptical when my new friend Mark claimed his site would soon act as a “personalized” and customized news source, I was fully committed to sharing images of my 3-year old grandson. I dreamed Facebook and I would grow old together, anticipating applications for home-bound seniors that could help us dote on our families.
Facebook: The anti-social network
By then radio stations, super markets and members of Congress had all signed up. Persons were depersonalized and “timelines” indeed became “news feeds” with unsubstantiated opinions sponsored by unknown pulpits dotting my virtual front page.
As the club got bigger, my younger friends drifted away to other social media. Suddenly, my boomer cohort came aboard. My 50-year class reunion in 2017 was organized via a closed group on the site.
Sadly, by then, the 2016 election had negatively colored my Facebook feed. Even before I learned that ersatz engagement may have impacted its results, the division and name calling among previously pleasant posters had gotten tiresome. I found myself mollifying my conservative contacts who were insulted by the indignation of my more liberal friends.
By last March, when Cambridge Analytica was suspected to have surreptitiously affected election results using tens of millions of Facebook members’ personal data, my ardor had dimmed more definitively. The massive security breach in September was proof the site was sloppy with my secrets. The final blow to our crumbling relationship came with December’s revelations that my once beloved was cheating on me with other commercial sites. My friendship facilitator had betrayed me. I was weary of being commodified.
As 2018 came to its inauspicious end, I posted a "Dear Facebook, it’s over," status update citing our lost faith. “The trust is gone in our relationship. ”
Our separation is cordial. I have not deleted the software from my laptop despite helpful instructions online on how to archive and sever. It seems too soon to be burning portals.
I changed my status to “closed” and have gone silent, with a sentimental sigh for lost love. I like to think my contacts are continuing the conversation without me.

Texto completo: A Lancaster County teacher has been announced as a finalist in a prestigious national literary competition.
Meghan Kenny, a seventh-grade English teacher at Lancaster Country Day School, is a finalist in the 2019 PEN America Literary Awards for her debut novel "The Driest Season."
More specifically, Kenny is a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award, which is awarded to an author who had not previously published a full-length fiction.
Writers and translators will be awarded more than $370,000 through the contest, which recognizes exceptional literary works published in 2018.
“The Driest Season” is about a teenager named Cielle living in Wisconsin farm country during the 1940s who finds her father in their barn after he had hanged himself. The story revolves around the aftermath of the hanging and how it affects Cielle, her older sister and their mother.
The novel was inspired by a short story Kenny wrote in 2005.
Kenny's debut novel was well-received, earning a positive review from the New York Times.
"'The Driest Season' took six years to write and four years to sell and publish," Kenny told LNP in 2018. "I believe in this novel. It’s close to my heart, and I worked hard to make sure it found a home, so it’s exciting and a huge relief to finally have it in the world."
Kenny will attend the award ceremony on Sunday, April 7, at the JFK Library in Boston, according to an email from a Lancaster Country Day School spokesperson.

Steve King to hold town hall Saturday

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King will hold his first town hall of the year— and first public meeting with his constituents after recent controversy — on Saturday in Primghar, Iowa.
The town hall will take place at the Primghar Community Building starting at 9 a.m. Saturday.
The event is open to the public and media, according to the news release from his office.
The gathering will be King's first time talking with 4th District residents in a public setting since recent controversy surrounding his comments in the New York Times.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" King said in an interview with the Times. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
King issued a statement condemning white nationalism and supremacy after a negative bipartisan response. But that didn't stop House Republicans from stripping him from committee assignments as punishment.
The House also passed a resolution which quoted King and condemned white supremacy and nationalism. King himself voted to approve the measure and encouraged all House members to vote for it.
But in the following days, King has made an appeal to his backers that the national response to King's comments were a smear campaign because of his immigration views and support of President Donald Trump.
"The unhinged left has teamed up with Republican 'NeverTrumpers' and is pulling out all the stops to destroy me," King wrote in a campaign email to his supporters.
King originally planned to hold his first town hall Thursday, but canceled the event because of changes to House schedule, his congressional office said.
In 2017, King said in a Sioux City Journal article he held fewer town halls in his district because of fears over safety and potential derailment by protesters.
The representative said he preferred tele-town halls and requested meetings with community members, where he could discuss policy without opening up the floor to protesters.
But after a close election in the 2018 election and several primary challengers already preparing to take on the Kiron incumbent, King said he plans to hold public meetings in all 39 counties throughout the 4th District.
Details of the locations and times of future town halls have not yet been released although the potential dates of the events were released. King said he will post details on coming town halls on his House website.

Texto completo: They say a picture is worth a thousand words. We'll have to make do with 600 or so.
The picture in question - the video, actually- electrified social media over the weekend. In it, a white high school boy wearing a "Make America Great Again" cap confronts an older Native American man who is beating a ceremonial drum and singing a Native song. The encounter took place Friday on the National Mall. The man was there as part of the Indigenous Peoples March. The boy was with a group from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky that was participating in the "March For Life" anti-abortion rally.
The man sings. The boy smirks. Some of his classmates mock the Native man. Someone yells, "Build the wall!" And there was, for many of us, something starkly symbolic in all of it, something that spoke of American fracture.
Yes, the story grew more complicated as details emerged over the weekend. It turns out the students had been drawn to the spot by a small group of black protesters - so-called Black Hebrew Israelites - using their First Amendment rights to curse and insult essentially everyone who was not them, including Catholics, whites, Native Americans and, at one point, a black person who disdained their toxic beliefs.
The students began what they described as a school spirit chant to drown out the black men. Tensions were high. And into this cauldron of ideology and identity stepped Nathan Phillips, a 64-year-old elder of the Omaha people and a Vietnam veteran. His aim in walking through the crowd, he said, was to settle things down. As he told The New York Times, "I stepped in between to pray."
The crowd, he said, parted to let him through. All except for the boy, since identified as Nick Sandmann, a junior. Phillips said the boy blocked him when he moved left. When he moved right, Sandmann did the same.
In a written statement, the boy denied blocking Phillips. "To be honest," he wrote, "I was startled and confused as to why he had approached me."
But the boy in that video, smirking, trying not to laugh, is not startled or confused. He looks, rather, entitled and smug.
Indeed, what gave the image its initial, visceral power was the sense that his expression was one we have seen before. It was on the face of an SS man as he cut off a rabbi's beard on a Warsaw street, on the face of an Alabama state trooper waiting at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Heck, it was on the face of a hulking high school boy as he prepared to dunk a smaller kid's head into the toilet. It was the eternal expression of the bully at the head of a mob.
Now here it was on this boy, using his First Amendment right to wear a hat many of us consider the functional equivalent of a pointy white hood, as he faced down a child of the people who named the Mississippi River and left the first footprints in the virgin soil of the Blue Ridge Mountains. All while someone yelled about building a wall. And if the story has grown more complicated, what hasn't changed is the sense that those images capture a nation at the breaking point.
As it happens, this story unfolded over the weekend we set aside to honor Martin Luther King, the confrontation itself occurring near the spot where he said, "I have a dream." That, of course, was on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a monument to the president who led this country through a war in which 2 percent of the population - the modern equivalent would be over 66 million people - died fighting over the meaning of freedom.
And Nathan Phillips' prayer? It was for unity, he said.

Texto completo: Technology played a major part in helping Boston police track down Olivia Ambrose. It wasn't some exotic computer program lurking inside a CSI-type laboratory, but a commonplace feature many consumers have learned to master on their own smartphones — location tracking.
Unable to reach her after a Saturday night visit to a Boston bar, Ambrose's sister used a common iPhone feature that lets people find the location of their friends or family members. The app told her sister that the last known location of Ambrose's phone, and perhaps Ambrose herself, was near the intersection of Corey Road and Walford Way in Charlestown, according to the police report filed in the arrest of Victor Pena.
By itself, this clue wasn't enough to locate Ambrose, and it would be another two days before police were able to enter Pena's apartment Tuesday afternoon and free Ambrose. In the intervening time, Pena allegedly had seized Ambrose's phone, preventing her from contacting anyone and keeping the phone itself from relaying additional information about her whereabouts.
But the sister's detective work did help police to narrow down the search area, and they used a combination of technology and shoe leather to zero in on Pena's apartment on Walford Way at the intersection with Corey Road — just where the iPhone app initially located Ambrose.
Security camera footage captured Ambrose leaving an MBTA station with an unidentified male. Police canvassed the Charlestown neighborhood, and two occupants of the Bunker Hill housing complex pointed them to Pena's apartment.
The episode is a reminder that location tracking was first added to mobile phones to help people in peril. In the early days of cellphones, calls to the 911 emergency system did not identify addresses as landline phones did.
So in 1996, the Federal Communications Commission ordered wireless phone companies to install systems that located cellphones making a 911 call. First, phone makers used the triangulation of radio signals from cell towers. Then came built-in GPS chips for greater accuracy. Phones can even calculate location using the signals of nearby Wi-Fi routers.
Beyond helping people in need, the new technology proved a boon to phone makers, carriers, and other businesses. By the mid-2000s, phones had navigation apps with turn-by-turn driving instructions. The makers of smartphone software — Apple for the iPhone and Google for Android — began scooping up our location data, for use in selling advertisements or providing local news and weather reports. Even the apps we install routinely track our whereabouts.
This nonstop monitoring has sometimes been put to questionable use. Earlier this month, the online tech news site Motherboard reported that wireless carriers T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T have been selling access to their customers' location data, and that some of it was being purchased by car salesmen, bail bondsmen, and bounty hunters. And The New York Times reported last year that some apps track a phone's location as frequently as 14,000 times per day, even when the app isn't being used.
“A lot of us look at it through the lens of privacy and say, that's terrible," said David Choffnes, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University. “But of course there are cases where it can be very helpful."

Texto completo: The Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh will mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which falls this year on Jan. 27, with these events:
• Screening of the French drama "Korkoro," 2 p.m. Jan. 27 at Regent Square Theater. The 2009 film tells the story of a Romani family traveling through France during World War II and trying to evade the Nazis.
The program will include a discussion of the experience of the Romani, colloquially known as Gypsies or Roma, during the Holocaust.
Tickets are $10, or free to Holocaust survivors and students with valid ID.
• Talk by Georgia Hunter, author of the New York Times bestselling novel "We Were the Lucky Ones," 7 p.m. Feb. 5 at Carnegie Library Lecture Hall in Oakland. Hunter's book is based on the true story of her family's survival during the Holocaust.
Her talk is presented in partnership with Pittsburgh Arts and Lectures.
Tickets are $18 in advance or $20 at the door, or free to Holocaust survivors and students with valid ID.
"Korkoro," which means "Alone" in the Romanes, premiered at the Montréal World Film Festival, winning the Grand Prize of the Americas. Released in France as "Liberté" in February 2010, it has been described as a "rare cinematic tribute" to those killed in the Porajmos, or the Romani genocide by the Nazis during World War II, according to the Holocaust Center.
"The Romani in Europe had faced centuries of persecution even before the Nazi rise to power, and the targeted genocide of this ethnic population during the Holocaust resulted in the loss of almost 25 percent of the Romani people," said Lauren Bairnsfather, director of the Holocaust Center. "In commemoration of International Holocaust Remembrance Day, it is important for us to shed light on the Romani experience -- one of the lesser-known aspects of the Holocaust."
The internationally recognized date for Holocaust Remembrance Day corresponds to the 27th day of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar. It marks the anniversary of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, an act of Jewish resistance when German troops and police entered the neighborhood in German-occupied Poland to deport remaining residents to concentration camps.

Texto completo: Wright State graduate and Centerville-raised Hannah Beachler is the first African-American female up for an Oscar for production design for her work on Marvel blockbuster film “Black Panther.”
The New York Times caught up with Beachler about her nomination .
Beachler told the newspaper she found out about the nomination while working on set in Cincinnati on a Todd Haynes film.
"I had to run to the back of the warehouse where the catering was so I could yell," she told the New York Times in an interview. "And then I cried."
Beachler told the Times she was grateful to the film's director, Ryan Coogler, who has hired her for all of his features.
"When I met him, everything changed," she told the Times. "He's my film-making family."
Their collaborations have included "Fruitvale Station" and "Creed."

Research has been key to success of all of her film projects, including “Black Panther,” she explained in the interview. That meant studying the ancient ruins of Mpumalanga in South Africa and bringing elements of its design into Wakanda, the fictional setting for "Black Panther." She said, "I started by asking, if there existed a culture that was that advanced, where would they be now?"
The production designer told the Times she hopes that opportunities for diversity in the industry will continue to advance as well.
"You never think a girl from Ohio, in the middle of nowhere, can get here," she told the Times. "It's a mission to let other girls and women of color know that they can do the same."

Editorial: Trump pursued deal in Russia and hid it from voters

Texto completo: Americans might soon learn what, if anything, special counsel Robert Mueller has found out about potential collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.
But there's one Trump-Moscow link where the emerging evidence is already as damning as it is disturbing.
During much, if not all, of Trump's campaign he sought to enrich himself by pursuing a luxury hotel-condominium-office deal in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow.
And as a candidate, Trump repeatedly misled or lied to voters about his business with Russia. "I have nothing to do with Russia," he told reporters in July 2016. "I don't deal there," he said during the Oct. 9 presidential debate.
OTHER VIEWS: ' ‘We still have no evidence of collusion’
The truth is, Trump had coveted a lucrative hotel project in Russia — whether to build one or license his name to be emblazoned on a skyscraper — for decades. "We will be in Moscow at some point," he said in a 2007 deposition.
Later, as a presidential candidate, he secretly signed an 18-page letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow on Oct. 28, 2015, the day of the third Republican presidential debate.
Court filings by Mueller in November make clear that negotiations led by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen continued through at least June 2016. Cohen lied about this to Congress to "give the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before 'the Iowa caucus and . . . the very first primary,' " according to the filings.
You have to wonder what the fallout would have been if those negotiations had been exposed before Trump debated his Republican primary opponents or Hillary Clinton. The electorate certainly was robbed of knowing about this crucial information at a time when:
►There were news reports that Russia was interfering in the election.
►Trump was expressing praise and admiration for President Vladimir Putin, even as he was insulting hundreds of other people, places and things on Twitter.
►The candidate said that, as president, he would consider easing sanctions placed against Russia for its violent seizure of Crimea.
►Trump was questioning America's continued role in NATO, a bulwark against Russian aggression that Putin has historically despised.
►A plank in the GOP platform regarding U. S. support for Ukraine was watered down.
►Trump challenged Moscow to release Democratic emails that Russians were reported to have hacked.
How does the president explain the appearance of a quid pro quo? By claiming that he was just keeping his options open. "There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won," Trump said in November, "in which case I would have gotten back into the (real estate development) business. And why should I lose lots of opportunities?"
Exactly when the Trump Tower Moscow "opportunity" collapsed remains murky. On Sunday, the president's current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, quoted Trump as telling him that project talks were "going on from the day I announced to the day I won. " By Monday, Giuliani was scrambling to walk back his comments to The New York Times and other news outlets.
But whether Trump was pursuing the arrangement until he clinched the Republican nomination, or right up until he was elected president, isn't the main point. What matters is that a presidential candidate was secretly negotiating a major business deal with a major U. S. adversary — an extraordinary conflict of interest that was concealed from voters.

The government doesn't dictate media in U.S.

Texto completo: Before the interview, el-Sisi's office had asked to receive the questions that he would be asked. 60 Minutes refused, and the interview proceeded. But immediately after the interview was recorded, the Egyptian government requested that CBS not air the interview. Again, CBS refused.
El-Sisi's regime is not the only government that has tried to suppress sensitive information. Earlier this month at the request of the Saudi government, Netflix made an episode of comedian Hasan Minhaj's show "Patriot Act" inaccessible in Saudi Arabia after he criticized Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his apparent approval of the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi and for Saudi Arabia's role in war atrocities in Yemen. And a court in Myanmar upheld the convictions and seven-year prison sentences of two Reuters journalists who reported on the slaughter of the country's Rohingya minority.
Even countries recognized as democracies have seen recent restrictions on disclosure of certain information. New Zealand's justice minister recently admonished Google after it revealed the identity of the man charged with murdering a 22-year-old backpacker in a "What's Trending in New Zealand" e-mail update.
New Zealand law allows for the suppression of the names of criminal defendants in certain cases. Meanwhile, France and several other countries have passed laws or taken other action to stem false news reports.
In the United States, of course, the First Amendment generally keeps the government from stopping or punishing revelations that public officials find embarrassing or deem to be harmful. Most famously, in 1971 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the federal government could not stop The New York Times, the Washington Post and other newspapers from publishing stories based on and excerpts of the Pentagon Papers, a classified history of American involvement in Vietnam up to the Vietnam War.
While six justices agreed with this result, they differed on their reasoning. In his concurring opinion, Justice Hugo Black wrote, "[W]e are asked to hold that ... the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary can make laws ... abridging freedom of the press in the name of 'national security.' ... To find that the President has 'inherent power' to halt the publication of news ... would wipe out the First Amendment and destroy the fundamental liberty and security of the very people the Government hopes to make 'secure.'"
The end result of the Pentagon Papers case and other cases is that the government must have a compelling reason for any prohibition on speech, and that the restriction must be "narrowly tailored" to achieve that interest.
While this standard has prevented most government attempts to limit speech in the United States, there have been a few cases in which such restrictions have been imposed by courts. In 1979, a federal trial court in Wisconsin issued a temporary injunction barring The Progressive magazine from publishing an article detailing the mechanics of the how the hydrogen bomb works, even though the article was compiled from unclassified, publicly-available sources. The case was dropped and the article was published after other publications published much of the information barred by the injunction against The Progressive.
And in an often forgotten case, a federal court issued a temporary order in 1990 barring CNN from airing tapes it had obtained of former Panamanian President Manuel Noriega speaking with his lawyer during his narcotics trafficking case. The order was upheld by a federal appeals court, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied review of the case. CNN aired the tapes while the appeal was pending, and was later held in contempt, after which it apologized.
While government efforts to stop the press from publishing are rare in the United States, there are occasional instances of this occurring. Last June, the press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security called a journalist who solicited tips about the press secretary on Twitter, telling him to stop doing so. And last January, an attorney for President Trump sent a letter demanding that writer Michael Wolff not release his book, "Fire and Fury." Trump also mused about revoking press credentials of media who report "fake news," and the White House actually did revoke CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass for a few days.
Still, media in the United States face these issues much less often than in other countries. That is the legacy of the First Amendment, court decisions like in the Pentagon Papers case, and the political culture and values of the United States. While there have been periodic threats to the principle that the media are free from prior restraints, this core idea has persisted. Unlike many other countries, in the United States the government does not control what appears in the media.

Texto completo: In 2012, the novelist Yiyun Li twice tried to take her own life. She wrote of the experience in "Dear Friend, From My Life I Write to You in Your Life," a series of enigmatic essays in which she traced her depression and lifelong desire to disappear. "You should be very careful every day for the rest of your life," she recalled a doctor warning her. "Things could sneak up on you."
There was no subtle creep of sadness to watch for, however. What happened was blunt and nightmarish. Months after the book was published, in 2017, Li's 16-year-old son killed himself.
In the months after his death, Li began writing a new novel. "Where Reasons End" imagines a dialogue between a mother and her teenage son after he has been lost to suicide. It is aloof, angular and idiosyncratic, as Li's personal pieces tend to be; her previous novels, like "The Vagrants" and "Kinder Than Solitude," in contrast, are more conventional, majestically bleak portraits, often of the Communist China of her childhood.
Li's characters share the credo from a Marianne Moore poem that "the deepest feeling always shows itself in silence; / not in silence, but restraint." (As a writer, Li has an avowed phobia of using the word "I" -- too melodramatic, she says.) Mother and son in this novel rarely openly grieve. There is no rage or accusation; the question of why he killed himself is never explicitly raised, although the mother suspects it lies in his harsh perfectionism:
"Who, my dear child, has taken the word lovable out of your dictionary and mine, and replaced it with perfect?
"I wish you had made me an enemy, I said, rather than yourself. Mothers, I thought, would be perfect for that role.
"You can't be that for me, Mommy, Nikolai said. I've found a perfect enemy in myself."
It's a rare moment of candor. Typically mother and son banter and philosophize, as clever (and occasionally grating) as characters out of Tom Stoppard. Their glittering debates about time, and the politics of grammar, feel like levies against overwhelming emotion.
When the mother succumbs from time to time, Nikolai mocks her. "Sometimes I'm so sad I feel like a freak," she says. "That sounds like self-pity unrestrained," he responds, superior and impatient -- a teenager. She reminds him that she does not mope, she does not keen. Only once does she permit herself a note of yearning when she recalls her son's "unhurried elegance." He used to remind her of a gray heron.
"Where Reasons End" belongs to a band of books produced in the forge of intense pain; their authors, aristocrats of suffering -- think of "The Year of Magical Thinking" and "Blue Nights," Joan Didion's memoirs of the deaths of her husband and daughter in close succession; "Wave," Sonali Deraniyagala's account of the loss of her children, husband and parents in the 2004 Asian tsunami; or "Family Life," Akhil Sharma's thinly fictionalized account of his brother's horrific accident in childhood.
Of course, "grief," "suffering" and "trauma" are words Li would never touch. It's shopworn language to her, cliché. "Can one's intelligence rely entirely on the public language; can one form a precise thought, recall an accurate memory, or even feel a genuine feeling, with only the public language?" she wrote in her memoir. Even her decision to write in English instead of Chinese emerges from this desire to communicate as truthfully as possible: "English is my private language. Every word has to be pondered over before it becomes my word."
For Li, to apply her own language to suicide means to understand suicide as the most private of decisions, to address it without cheap sentiment or condemnation. "Calling Nikolai's action inexplicable was like calling a migrant bird ending on a new continent lost," the mother thinks to herself. "Who can say the vagrant doesn't have a reason to change the course of its flight? Nothing inexplicable for me -- only I didn't want to explain: A mother's job is to enfold, not to unfold."
At first, I found this statement confusing and evasive. Does "to enfold" mean to blandly excuse? And can't "unfolding" -- the act of delving, of analysis -- be construed as a kind of love?
Then I remembered the orca. Last year, a grieving mother orca in the Pacific Northwest carried her dead calf on her head for more than 17 days and 1,000 miles. The world was transfixed -- not purely out of pity, I suspect, but recognition. Who has not wanted to keep their dead close, even carry them, as proof of their pain? Recall the stage directions in "King Lear": "Enter Lear with Cordelia in his arms."
At first glance, this book seems constructed of very cerebral debates between mother and son -- even the epigraph, Elizabeth Bishop's poem "Argument," includes the line: "argue argue argue with me." But the arguments in the novel never build. They eddy. Nikolai picks a little at his mother; she accepts it, almost gratefully. As the title alerts us, this book takes place in a territory beyond reason, in all its connotations -- beyond explanation or understanding. The mother does not require them. In the final reckoning, there is nothing she needs from Nikolai other than his company, his ghost; to carry him for a moment more, to keep the story going.
"We once gave Nikolai a life of flesh and blood; and I'm doing it over again, this time by words," she writes. "Where else can we meet but in stories now?"

Texto completo: When you look at the Senate Democrats who have announced their presidential campaigns so far, you notice that each one has a theme. For example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has made her career about reform of the financial industry. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., has made hers about preventing workplace sexual harassment. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who has all but announced his candidacy with his tour of Iowa, has made his campaign about what Democrats still have to offer the working class.

But what about Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who announced her candidacy on Monday?

Look only at her two years in the Senate and two relevant data points pop up. First, there’s her recent attempt, along with Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, to apply an anti-Catholic religious test to a judicial nominee because he belonged to the Knights of Columbus. This was too much even for her fellow Democrats to bear — not a single one objected to a resolution that implicitly rebuked Harris and Hirono for their behavior.

The second relevant point is Harris’ conduct during the Justice Brett Kavanaugh hearings. No, not the contentious second round of Kavanaugh hearings involving sexual misconduct allegations, but the relatively placid first round in early September. During that process, Harris insinuated, through a line of questioning, that Kavanaugh had held a highly improper conversation about the Russia investigation with someone at the law firm President Trump had hired. After casting this slanderous aspersion, Harris then knowingly lied to journalists in order to prejudice public opinion against Kavanaugh's nomination. She falsely assured reporters that she had "good reason" and "reliable" evidence that Kavanaugh had indeed discussed the Russia investigation with lawyers at Trump's firm.

Then, as it turned out, she didn't have any evidence at all. She had been bluffing, the way unethical prosecutors do when trying to get people to plead guilty to offenses they didn't commit. But this wasn’t some police interrogation room — it was a Senate committee hearing. Harris was thus exposed as a liar the moment her bluff was called. But it illustrates how accustomed she already was to using prosecutorial power and access to the media to smear and bully the innocent and guilty alike.

These two incidents clearly indicate the kind of progressivism that Harris espouses. It is the same intolerant, authoritarian, by-any-means ideology that stretches back into her earlier career as a prosecutor and as attorney general of California.

As attorney general, Lara Bazelon wrote recently in the New York Times, Harris “fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors.” This fits with her more recent behavior.

Harris was also fond of overcriminalization. She supported legislation that would jail the parents of truant children. She strongly opposed criminal justice reform measures throughout her tenure in California. She also supported the Golden State’s unconstitutional law muzzling crisis pregnancy centers, which the Supreme Court struck down last year as a clear violation of the First Amendment and an attempt to criminalize the moral and political viewpoints of others.

Harris is now running under the motto, “For the People,” a legal reference that embodies her aspiration to become the nation’s prosecutor in chief. Her nomination would be an odd turn for progressives to take, given their recent hostility toward all law enforcement. On the other hand, it would fit perfectly with the Left's general desire to punish people who disagree with their views — whether it be Kavanaugh, Catholic students peacefully standing around at an anti-abortion demonstration, second lady Karen Pence's Christian school, the Little Sisters of the Poor, or Trump and everyone who works for him.

Harris is here, and she’s running, and she's everything scary about today’s intolerant Left.

Chief Justice John Roberts right to push back against Trump, defend judiciary

Texto completo: In November, a federal judge in San Francisco struck down President Trump’s attempt to limit asylum-seekers to legal points of entry. Trump complained about the action of “an Obama Judge.”
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts criticized Trump, saying America does not have “Obama judges or Trump judges . . . What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”
In December, a federal judge in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”). The judge had been appointed by President George W. Bush. Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut, said that “Republicans just blew up our health care system.” Press comments have portrayed the judge’s ruling as political and characterized the Fifth Circuit (comprised of Southern states), which will hear any appeal, that way as well.
Will Chief Justice Roberts be even-handed now and criticize those calling the federal court decision in Texas the act of Republicans? Perhaps he regrets having entered this forum in the first place. Roberts has challenged Trump in a sport at which Trump excels. When federal District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii ruled against the Trump travel ban (called the “Muslim ban” by its detractors), Trump was fulsome in criticizing the judge as political because President Obama had appointed him. Trump called the San Diego judge hearing the case against Trump University biased because the Indiana-born Judge’s parents were from Mexico — making at least two offensive leaps that a judge who was the son of Mexican immigrants would be prejudiced against Trump due to Trump’s comments on Mexicans, and that the prejudice would be so great it would affect the judge’s impartiality in a matter totally unrelated to Mexico or immigration.
Federal judges are called to make decisions based on the law, not their own policy preferences. President Trump and Senator Murphy have done much harm in blurring that distinction.
This is not to say federal judges are identical. Litigants choose courts to file suits where they have the best chance of winning. Trump noted the “Obama Judge” was in San Francisco, within the liberal-leaning 9th Circuit that often rules against him. After the Obamacare ruling, the New York Times observed that “conservative lawyers are known to choose [the federal court in Texas] to file cases.” Neither practice is improper, so long as the court decision itself is based on nonpolitical grounds.
When Trump opponents win at the trial court level, they then try to get the court to apply its ruling to the entire country. That’s what the federal judge in San Francisco did, blocking Trump’s asylum policy nationwide. The federal judge in Texas has not yet given national application to his order striking down Obamacare. If he does, expect Democratic politicians who praised the San Francisco judge’s nationwide order to be outraged by the Texas judge doing the same thing, and expect Trump to praise the judge’s wisdom.
The judiciary interprets laws; it has no power to make laws. Judges are fairly criticized when their legal interpretation seems to create new law that Congress or state legislatures never intended. But Murphy and Trump labeling judges based on which president appointed them goes far beyond fair criticism. This kind of attack, if repeated often enough, will eventually impede the vital function courts perform in our constitutional scheme. A calumny often repeated sometimes sticks. When the law compels a politically unpopular outcome in a case, Americans should hope the judge ignores the political and does what’s right. That’s especially important to those who care deeply about civil liberties. I doubt the Bill of Rights’ protections for criminals would be approved in a popular referendum today. Segregated schools were the result of popular majority votes. America loses something precious if the third branch, fearful of being labeled political, begins to act in a political way.

He was also California Director of Finance. In 2016, he left the Republican Party and is now an independent.

Chess-playing Machine Could Change The Way We Think About Thinking

Texto completo: In early December, researchers at DeepMind, the artificial-intelligence company owned by Google’s parent corporation, Alphabet Inc., filed a dispatch from the frontiers of chess.
A year earlier, on Dec. 5, 2017, the team had stunned the chess world with its announcement of AlphaZero, a machine-learning algorithm that had mastered not only chess but shogi, or Japanese chess, and Go. The algorithm started with no knowledge of the games beyond their basic rules. It then played against itself millions of times and learned from its mistakes. In a matter of hours, the algorithm became the best player, human or computer, the world has ever seen.
The details of AlphaZero’s achievements and inner workings have now been formally peer-reviewed and published in the journal Science. The new paper addresses several serious criticisms of the original claim. (Among other things, it was hard to tell whether AlphaZero was playing its chosen opponent, a computational beast named Stockfish, with total fairness.) Consider those concerns dispelled. AlphaZero has not grown stronger in the past 12 months, but the evidence of its superiority has. It clearly displays a breed of intellect that humans have not seen before, and that we will be mulling over for a long time to come.
Not like it used to be
Computer chess has come a long way in 20 years. In 1997, IBM’s chess-playing supercomputer, Deep Blue, beat the reigning human world champion, Garry Kasparov, in a six-game match. In retrospect, there was little mystery in this achievement. Deep Blue could evaluate 200 million positions per second. It never got tired, never blundered in a calculation and never forgot what it had been thinking a moment earlier.
For better and worse, it played like a machine, brutally and materialistically. It could outcompute Kasparov, but it couldn’t outthink him. In Game 1 of their match, Deep Blue greedily accepted Kasparov’s sacrifice of a rook for a bishop, but lost the game 16 moves later. The current generation of the world’s strongest chess programs, such as Stockfish and Komodo, still play in this inhuman style. They like to capture the opponent’s pieces. They defend like iron. But although they are far stronger than any human player, these chess “engines” have no real understanding of the game. They have to be tutored in the basic principles of chess.
These principles, which have been refined over decades of human grandmaster experience, are programmed into the engines as complex evaluation functions that indicate what to seek in a position and what to avoid: how much to value king safety, piece activity, pawn structure, control of the center, and more, and how to balance the trade-offs among them. Today’s chess engines, innately oblivious to these principles, come across as brutes: tremendously fast and strong, but utterly lacking insight.
New way of learning
All of that has changed with the rise of machine learning. By playing against itself and updating its neural network as it learned from experience, AlphaZero discovered the principles of chess on its own and quickly became the best player ever. Not only could it have easily defeated all the human masters - it didn’t even bother to try - it crushed Stockfish, the reigning computer world champion of chess. In a 100-game match against a truly formidable engine, AlphaZero scored 28 wins and 72 draws. It didn’t lose a single game.
Most unnerving was that AlphaZero seemed to express insight. It played as no computer ever had, intuitively and beautifully, with a romantic, attacking style. It played gambits and took risks. In some games it paralyzed Stockfish and toyed with it. While conducting its attack in Game 10, AlphaZero retreated its queen back into the corner of the board on its own side, far from Stockfish’s king, not normally where an attacking queen should be placed. Yet this peculiar retreat was venomous: No matter how Stockfish replied, it was doomed.
Tellingly, AlphaZero won by thinking smarter, not faster; it examined only 60,000 positions a second, compared with 60 million for Stockfish. It was wiser, knowing what to think about and what to ignore. By discovering the principles of chess on its own, AlphaZero developed a style of play that “reflects the truth” about the game rather than “the priorities and prejudices of programmers,” Kasparov wrote in a commentary accompanying the Science article.
The question now is whether machine learning can help humans discover similar truths about the things we really care about.
The early signs are encouraging. In August, two articles in Nature Medicine explored how machine learning could be applied to medical diagnosis. In one, researchers at DeepMind teamed up with clinicians at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London to develop a deep-learning algorithm that could classify a wide range of retinal pathologies as accurately as human experts can.
Benefit for humans
The other article concerned a machine-learning algorithm that decides whether a CT scan of an emergency-room patient shows signs of a stroke, an intracranial hemorrhage or other critical neurological event. For stroke victims, every minute matters. (Neurologists have a grim saying: “Time is brain.”) The new algorithm flagged these and other critical events with an accuracy comparable to human experts - but it did so 150 times faster. A faster diagnostician could allow the most urgent cases to be triaged sooner, with review by a human radiologist.
What is frustrating about machine learning, however, is that the algorithms can’t articulate what they’re thinking. We don’t know why they work, so we don’t know if they can be trusted. AlphaZero gives every appearance of having discovered some important principles about chess, but it can’t share that understanding with us. Not yet, at least. As humans, we want more than answers. We want insight. This is going to be a source of tension in our interactions with computers from now on.
In fact, in mathematics, it’s been happening for years. Consider the long-standing math problem called the four-color map theorem. It proposes that, under certain reasonable constraints, any map of contiguous countries can always be colored with just four colors such that no two neighboring countries are colored the same.
Although the four-color theorem was proved in 1977 with the help of a computer, no human could check all the steps in the argument. Since then, the proof has been validated and simplified, but there are still parts of it that entail brute-force computation. This development annoyed many mathematicians. They didn’t need to be reassured that the four-color theorem was true. They wanted to understand why it was true, and this proof didn’t help.
But envisage a day when AlphaZero has evolved into a more general problem-solving algorithm; call it AlphaInfinity. Like its ancestor, it would have supreme insight. And each beautiful proof would reveal why a theorem was true.
For human mathematicians and scientists, this day would mark the dawn of a new era of insight. But it may not last. As machines become ever faster, and humans stay put with their neurons running at sluggish millisecond time scales, another day will follow when we can no longer keep up. The dawn of human insight may quickly turn to dusk.

Matt Damon showed up to the World Economic Forum wearing another man's clothes

Texto completo: Matt Damon was wearing another man's clothes when he arrived at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday.
Damon fell victim to the perils of air travel, telling a panel hosted by Bloomberg that he was forced to don the duds of his Water.org cofounder, Gary White , after Swiss Air misplaced his luggage.
“The relationship has developed to the point where I'm wearing Gary's clothes right now, because Swiss Air lost my bags," Damon said, when asked about his relationship with White, with whom he cofounded Water.org in 2009. “So we've come a long way."
Baggage mishaps aside, Damon talked about why he has made worldwide access to safe drinking water his primary philanthropic focus.
“It underlines everything," Damon said. “All these issues of extreme poverty are affected by it. It really touches everything. You can't solve any of these problems we're talking about today — gender equality, climate change, all of these things — water touches all of them."
In addition to Damon, a who's who of the Boston area's biggest names in business and education planned to attend the summit. Celtics co-owner and Bain Capital co-chairman Stephen Pagliuca was scheduled to make the trek along with six Bain & Co. leaders, and at least five higher-ups at Boston Consulting Group were on the guest list, including chairman Hans-Paul Bürkner . In the education realm, the forum was expected to welcome at least 10 Harvard-affiliated guests, including Harvard University president Lawrence Bacow . And MIT and Yale had at least seven university-affiliated attendees each on the RSVP list, including Yale president Peter Salovey and MIT president L. Rafael Raif .
Other notables with local ties scheduled to make the trip to Switzerland included chairman, president, and CEO of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company Roger Crandall , Bank of America vice chairman Anne Finucane , and Iron Mountain president and CEO William Meaney .
Several weighty topics were on the agenda at the WEF on Tuesday, but in one case a soundbite got the attention. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, taking part in a CNBC panel, was asked by a moderator if he had a message for President Trump , who canceled his trip to Davos because of the government shutdown. After a couple of false starts, the former senator from Massachusetts boiled his message down to one word: “Resign."
Several other events were scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. Former Harvard assistant professor and New York Times best-selling author Amy Cuddy was on a panel about violence against women that also included Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege , and Microsoft founder Bill Gates joined a panel examining how to build improved financial architecture to support global health initiatives.
One Boston-based businessman making waves at Davos wasn't even at the summit.
Seth Klarman , a billionaire investor who runs the Boston-based Baupost Group and has been called the “Oracle of Boston," sent a letter to investors — including overseers of Harvard's and Yale's endowments — that raises “a huge red flag about global social tensions, rising debt levels and receding American leadership," according to a Tuesday article from The New York Times.
The Times story predicted that Klarman's letter would be the talk of the town, writing that it was “likely to add to the hand-wringing that typically takes place in Davos during a week of panels and conversation over Champagne and canapés."

Texto completo: Now people can watch the disk's rotation - and eventual demise - from the comfort of home.
Westbrook's world-famous ice disk is ready for its close-up - at least it better be.
There's now a webcam that broadcasts the daytime movements of the disk, which has been spinning in the Presumpscot River for more than a week and continues its counterclockwise rotation, despite a new covering of several inches of fresh snow over the weekend.
Such disks are known to occur under just the right conditions, but the Westbrook version has the advantage of being unusually large - about 100 yards across - and in a downtown location where it's easy to see. And where, perhaps, it's too accessible - someone planted a small American flag in the disk's center and a rainbow flag on a pole near the edge of the disk.
Although city officials are discouraging anyone from trying to walk onto or otherwise disturb the disk, the flag on the outer edge does allow those monitoring the disk from the comfort of home to spot the steady counterclockwise rotation of the phenomenon.
The image can be found at mooseheadwebcams.com, which primarily has webcam images of various spots around Moosehead Lake in northern Maine.
Tina Radel, the city of Westbrook's marketing and communications manager, said Brown University asked to put up the webcam to monitor the growth and eventual demise of the ice disk. Rob Mitchell, the owner of a building on Ash Street, gave his approval, and Ethos Marketing, which is the building's tenant, allowed the college to access its internet network to stream the pictures.
The webcam captures an image once every minute, and the site includes a clip of the previous day's images strung together for a time-lapse of the disk that effectively shows it in motion.
Radel said the disk seemed to get a little smaller Sunday as a storm moved into the state, but then appeared to rebound after the precipitation stopped and cold air swept in.
"It actually looks like it grew larger last night," she said.
The disk has attracted worldwide media attention with reports by the BBC, U.S. television networks, The Boston Globe and The New York Times, among others.
The interest seems to have ebbed somewhat, Radel said, although she got emails Monday seeking approval to use time-lapse images - which Radel put on the city's Facebook page - from a site in France and from The Washington Post. News about the storm on the East Coast seemed to overwhelm interest in the disk on Saturday and Sunday.
"It slowed down, which was nice for the weekend," she said.
The disk actually stopped spinning last Wednesday when it got stuck to ice on the riverbank. A Freeport man came to the rescue Thursday with a paddleboard and an ice pick and broke it free.
Besides the media attention, the ice disk has drawn crowds to Westbrook as people feel compelled to see the phenomenon in person. That has pleased the operators of downtown businesses, including one bar that has been serving "Ice Disk Cosmos."

Recall MLK's words on good people staying silent

Texto completo: Our topic for today: three stories and a letter.
The stories all made recent headlines. The first was about the state of Florida posthumously pardoning the Groveland Four, a group of African-American men who suffered torture, prison and murder after being falsely accused of raping a white woman in 1949.
The second concerns broad Republican condemnation of one of their own, Rep. Steve King, for an interview with The New York Times in which he questioned why the terms "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" should be considered offensive.
The third involves a directive -- since rescinded -- NBC News sent its writers, reporters and anchors about King's words. "Be careful to avoid characterizing [King's] remarks as racist," it said, suggesting that the remarks instead be described as 'what many are calling racist'."
As for the letter: It was written by Martin Luther King Jr., whose 90th birthday the nation commemorates Monday. King famously penned the epistle from a jail cell in Birmingham in response to a group of white clergymen, eight moderate, principled men, who had condemned as "unwise and untimely" his demonstrations against segregation in their city.
One passage of King's response seems especially apropos to this moment. In it, he confessed that he had become "gravely disappointed with the white moderate." Too often, he said, they were "more devoted to 'order' than to justice;" and preferred "a negative peace, which is the absence of tension to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice."
Added King: "Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will."
Make no mistake: King well knew that all over the South, liberal white kids were risking their lives for black freedom. He was calling out other white people, often older, more moderate white people like those eight men, for the tepidness and flaccidity of their commitment to racial reconciliation. This was 1963, but as the stories above suggest, that problem endures.
It is possible, for instance, to celebrate that Florida has finally done right by the Groveland Four -- and yet, to also be disgusted that it takes 70 years for the state to belatedly admit its crimes and deliver some small measure of delayed "justice."
It is possible to consider the GOP's condemnation of Steve King all well and fine, yet also a little arbitrary and affected given that he has a history of racist rhetoric that passed without his party seeming to much notice or care -- and that the GOP itself has a long record of thinly-veiled racism as obvious as the writing on Barack Obama's birth certificate.
It is possible to concede that NBC has an interest in ensuring its people remain disinterested observers of events they report, yet feel that in asking them to refrain from calling obvious racism obvious racism, the network doesn't embody journalistic rigor so much as it does white peoples' too frequent refusal to call out such racism even when it's right in front of them.
We may safely assume most NBC executives, Republican lawmakers and Florida officials would say -- and probably believe -- all the right things if you asked about their commitment to racial justice. Yet given a chance to put force behind that commitment, they failed. In Florida's case, they failed for seven decades.
"The ultimate tragedy," MLK once said, "is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people." He was right.
If you are good, yet silent, maybe you're not really as good as you think.

High court needs to explain clemency overrides

Resumen: In March 2018, the California Supreme Court published a remarkable order, signed by all six sitting justices, intended to clarify its role in reviewing acts of clemency by the governor. Why did the court consider Brown's reduction of sentences not immediate releases for a number of second-degree murder convictions to meet the vague standard of "abuse of power"? Why did the court OK the pardon for Rod Wright, the former Democratic state senator convicted for lying about living in his district?

Texto completo: In March 2018, the California Supreme Court published a remarkable order, signed by all six sitting justices, intended to clarify its role in reviewing acts of clemency by the governor. This interesting, nine-page administrative order details the history of California's peculiar restrictions on the pardon powers of our governors, and clearly states that the court does not review the cases on their merits, but confines its overrides to cases "that represent an abuse of power."
No definitions, no rational standards, and only a single precedent are provided, but respect is expressed for the executive's "power to grant clemency on whatever grounds he or she deems appropriate" and for separation of powers. The order was created by the court for the court, not the result of a lawsuit or appeal.
As expected, Gov. Brown was more generous with pardons and commutations in his final year, and for the first time since 1930, the court intervened in 10 cases to reject Brown's decisions.
If we hold the court to its own standards, we must conclude that it found Gov. Brown abused his power. I submit that the justices are abusing their discretion in a secretive process that leaves the public to speculate about their motives.
Why, in the most disturbing case, did the court overrule the governor's pardon of Borey Ai, who won parole in 2016, and is now subject to mandatory deportation to Cambodia, the nation his parents fled before he was born?
Why did the court consider Brown's reduction of sentences not immediate releases for a number of second-degree murder convictions to meet the vague standard of "abuse of power"?
Why did the court OK the pardon for Rod Wright, the former Democratic state senator convicted for lying about living in his district?
And how do these cases compare to Gov. Schwarzenegger's commutation for the son of former Speaker Fabian Nuñez?
The court has agreed to release the sealed documents from the Wright case, so we can hope to learn more about it. The court should be fully transparent in all of these cases and articulate clear standards to the public and clemency petitioners. It must explain why the governor's pardon of ex-convict Borey Ai was an abuse of power, requiring their intervention and essentially deciding in favor of Ai's deportation.
Leaving it to legal experts to comment on separation of powers issues, I do see a major conflict of interest, as the court controls the broken process that led these convicts to seek clemency in the first place. We can be sure that almost every one of them has brought numerous appeals that reached the court, and they went to the governor as a last resort. Then, at the final stage, the court cherry-picked 10 of them for rejection with no explanation so far.
As a radio host, and an advocate for wrongfully convicted prisoners, I've had a number of exchanges with Jerry Brown about prisons and parole. I think he deserves credit for many reforms, reducing the state prison population and allowing the parole system to work as intended.
He also fixed the sentencing laws he screwed up in the 1970s. But the Rose Bird recall and his stints as Oakland's mayor and attorney general left him cautious about being seen as "soft on crime." He's never used his clemency power in a blatantly political move, like President Trump's pardon for Joe Arpaio. And he didn't try to clear death row, as advocated by six former governors in a December op-ed in the New York Times.
It's an insult to Brown for the court to veto his decisions without any showing of improper motive or abuse of power. And respect for the court is undermined by its secretive and arbitrary actions in these cases.

Conspiracy theories fall through

Texto completo: Before we get to the question of whether the president of the United States is a Russian asset, let's consider another question: When was the last time a popular and contentious conspiracy theory turned out to be true? Not a little true, but, like, really true?
It does happen. Whittaker Chambers was right about Alger Hiss being a Soviet spy. The government really did put poison in legal alcohol during Prohibition.
But even when conspiracy theorists earn the right to say "We told you so," the actual reality often falls short of the mark. The motives of the conspirators aren't as sinister as claimed, or the plot is better explained by incompetence than malevolence, or the scope of the conspiracy itself isn't nearly as vast as suspected.
This has always been my problem with the most extreme versions of the Russian collusion theories. The British former journalist and politician Louise Mensch offers an extreme version. Among her claims: Vladimir Putin had my late friend Andrew Breitbart murdered so that former Donald Trump consigliere Steve Bannon could take over Breitbart's eponymous website; Russian intelligence planted Hillary Clinton's emails on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop; pretty much the whole of the GOP leadership is in cahoots with the Kremlin.
I have a similar problem with the Deep State theories that have bounced around the Trumpian right: Trump's problems are all the result of the fiendish doings of a vast "globalist" conspiracy.
"The central premise," Infowars nutter Jerome Corsi writes in his book "Killing the Deep State," "is that President Trump is the target of a coup d'etat being undertaken by the Deep State, including the CIA, NSA, and other intelligence agencies that maintain a commitment to a globalist New World Order." The Deep State hates Trump, the argument goes, because his victory meant it could no longer "continue running the international drug trade while supporting the military-industrial complex in a policy of perpetual war."
Obviously, most sane people on either side of the Trumpian divide reject the cartoonish versions of their own positions. But similarities endure.
Pattern recognition is one of humanity's great evolutionary advantages. It is the foundation for trial and error, the scientific method and reason itself. But it can also mislead us. Most conspiracy theories involve motivated reasoning in which we deduce backward from a result, cherry-picking which dots to connect to fit a preexisting idea.
The people who insist that Trump colluded with Russia start with the explanation -- the election was "stolen" by Russia -- and then pluck facts to fit. And there are many such facts.
But, as Trump defenders and even Trump himself will quickly note, there are many contrary facts as well. His energy policies, for example, are deeply contrary to Russia's interests.
The bombshell New York Times report that the FBI opened an investigation into whether Trump was a Russian asset strikes me as simultaneously understandable and outrageous. Trump's behavior in 2016 and early 2017 was enough to overload the pattern-recognition software of anyone not already committed to Trump's innocence at all costs, particularly if you were both reading the news and receiving raw, and occasionally flawed, intelligence such as the Steele dossier.
Trump's disastrous hiring of actual Kremlin stooges and cronies, his praise of Putin, his lies about business dealings with Russia, his public beseeching of the Kremlin to release Clinton's emails, his campaign's infamous meeting at Trump Tower with an actual Russian agent, not to mention his firing of the FBI director and his comments to Russian officials in the Oval Office: One doesn't even need to resort to Deep State theories to understand why the FBI would be concerned.
But that doesn't necessarily make Trump a Manchurian president either.
He or his campaign may or may not have colluded with Russia. The Department of Justice might have cut corners to "get" him. Still, rather than elaborate conspiracies, it's far more likely that ad hoc decisions were made in the response to ad hoc actions by a candidate who thought he was going to lose and, later, by a president who didn't know what he was doing.
Jeb Bush was right when he predicted in 2015 that "chaos candidate" Trump would be a "chaos president." The Atlantic just published a list, "Unthinkable: 50 Moments that Define an Improbable Presidency," and what comes through most is that Trump's glandular, impulsive and often vindictive character is the only reliable signal in the noise that is his presidency. Any theory that doesn't take this into account is not likely to pan out.

Texto completo: It's hard to believe that one racially charged interview in the New York Times was what it took to garner a meaningful punishment from congressional Republicans of Iowa's long-standing, race-baiting congressman, Steve King. It's infuriating that it took that interview for his Republican Senate colleagues from Iowa, who've been well aware of his legacy of saying such things, to even criticize him. It's about time.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King was quoted telling the Times last week. Monday night, the House Republican leadership responded by removing King from its agriculture and judiciary committees, and the full House voted almost unanimously (one member wanted to go farther) to disapprove of him.
As every Iowan knows, that's one interview out of scores of statements and positions the 4th Congressional District representative has proudly offered up denigrating non-Western, nonwhite, Central American or Muslim people throughout his decades-long political career. Imagine if Iowa's other high-ranking elected officials had taken a principled stand before they were shamed into doing so by national fellow Republicans.
Only in recent days have Sens. Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst condemned King. Shortly before the 2018 election, Grassley could be seen on video calling King an "ally" he needed in the House. But after the Times piece brought wide condemnations of King, as did a Washington Post column by South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott, who is black, Grassley finally spoke up. Scott wrote, "King's comments are not conservative views but separate views that should be ridiculed at every turn possible."
Last Saturday, Ernst tweeted Scott's piece and condemned King's comments as "offensive and racist and not representative of Iowa." Grassley told reporters from Axios, "I find it offensive to claim white supremacy. I will condemn it."
Where have you been, senators? And where was Gov. Kim Reynolds, who just won election with King as her campaign co-chair? Then she was praising him as "principled." But after winning, she said something about his needing to decide whose values he represents.
In case they've forgotten, here's a little refresher on King's actions and pronouncements:
A Washington Post story this past fall said King had met in August in Austria with members of the Freedom Party, founded by a former Nazi SS officer. He also granted an interview to a website associated with the party. This was while King was on a trip to Poland paid for by a group dedicated to preserving the history of the Holocaust.
He has said nonwhites have contributed less to civilization than white people; that America can't restore its civilization with "someone else's babies," and that "mixing cultures will bring down the quality of life." He called for America to be so homogeneous that we "look a lot the same."
He proposed an electrified fence to keep Mexicans out, noting, "We do that with livestock." He described Mexicans as having cantaloupe-size calves from running drugs. He justified torturing political prisoners in Abu Ghraib, comparing it to fraternity hazing.
While keeping a Confederate flag on his desk, he held up reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in Congress. He introduced legislation lobbied for by ACT for America, listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-Muslim hate group. He went to bat for the convicted former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who defied a judge's orders not to detain immigrants nabbed through ethnic profiling. He lavished praise on European politicians for going after Muslims and trying to ban mosques and the Koran.
The Register has quoted more such comments by King over the years than I can count.
King endorsed a white-nationalist candidate for mayor of Toronto, earning the condemnation of writers for the conservative Washington Examiner and Weekly Standard, who called out his obsession with race-based politics.
Imagine if Iowa leaders had had this awakening about King 10 or 15 years ago, how things might be different for the state, and especially for King's 39-county House district. Instead of being demonized, immigrants could had been welcomed and encouraged by their representative to help grow the region, its agriculture and small businesses. Instead of being so deeply divided and polarized under King's leadership, the people of the district might have functioned as one, with a shared commitment to progress and growth.
Instead, his supporters have defensively carried water for him while his detractors have felt compelled to shrink from the limelight, embarrassed.
"That is not the party of Lincoln and it's definitely not American," House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said of King in stripping his committee assignments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested King find "another line of work."
Whatever your political views, real leadership means doing what's right when you learn what's wrong, not after everyone else has already condemned it - and then because of polls or popularity or because your career could suffer if you don't.
Whatever happens to King's career, one can only hope our other top leaders will learn from this and get on the right side for the right reasons - promptly next time.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Owners Tied to Plan to Hide OxyContin Risk" (Business Day, Jan. 16), documenting the talking points of Richard Sackler, then the president of Purdue Pharma, while misleading the public in 2001:
I met with a representative of Purdue Pharma around that time while an editorial writer with The Day of New London, Conn. I have never forgotten the meeting. He was combative and echoed exactly Mr. Sackler's contention that those who were addicted to OxyContin were misusing the drug and were therefore criminals.
This repulsive argument sought to place the entire blame on the people who became addicted to OxyContin while holding the company harmless.
Now the body count of opioid overdose victims is in the hundreds of thousands. The Sacklers should not be lauded and honored for wealth that is built on the bones of far too many children and family members, dead because of their product. The entire family should be, at a minimum, shunned and shamed for their greed in seeking profits heedless of human pain.
Maura J. Casey
Franklin, Conn.
The writer is a former editorial writer for The New York Times.

Texto completo: Dear Readers: Back in the day the first thing I’d read when I opened my Daily Herald was Jim O’Donnell’s media column. I found him to be bright and articulate with a vocabulary shared by few. I knew someday I’d enjoy working with him if given the chance.
O’Donnell, with his decades of connections, knows the Chicago sports scene, so what better than to have him complement our lineup of knowledgeable, familiar experts: Dietz, Gregor, McGraw, Miles and Rozner.
O’Donnell returns today to the Friday Sports pages of The Daily Herald with a sports media column. I’m confident you’ll enjoy his eye for detail, insight, great reporting and occasional feather-ruffling.
In addition to previous work here, the award-winning O’Donnell has written for Frank Deford’s National Sports Daily, the Sun-Times, the Tribune and The New York Times. He also worked on two best-selling books authorized by Michael Jordan, and while a freelance radio writer he worked with Steve Dahl and Garry Meier.
He’s back with us. Once you read his column, you’ll want to keep reading him.

Texto completo: An art exhibition, a play and more events that will help you commemorate the civil rights leader.
'Crusader: Martin Luther King Jr.'
This newly opened photography exhibition features images of Dr. King's Gandhi-inspired pilgrimage to India in 1959 and the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in which he was honored for his nonviolent crusade against racism. The exhibition continues through April 6 at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Manhattan; nypl.org/locations/schomburg.
'Turning 15 on the Road to Freedom'
In 1965 Lynda Blackmon Lowery marched as a teenager alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. She was jailed nine times before she turned 15 and was beaten on Bloody Sunday, when civil rights protesters were attacked by police officers and vigilantes. This play, adapted from Ms. Lowery's memoir, dramatizes her experiences. She'll be on hand for discussions after both matinee performances. Jan. 19 at 2 and 7 p.m., and Jan. 20 at 2 and 6 p.m. at the Riverside Church, 490 Riverside Drive; Manhattan; trcnyc.org.
'Unsung Champions of Civil Rights From MLK to Today'
Jami Floyd and Brian Lehrer of Public Radio's WNYC host a free program of interviews and panels focusing on the activists who have not yet received the recognition they deserve. The event will also include a photography exhibition and performances by Rutha Harris of the Freedom Singers and members of Urban Word NYC. Chester Higgins Jr., a former New York Times staff photographer, will be among the guests. RSVP in advance. Jan. 20 at 3 p.m. at the Apollo Theater; apollotheater.org/uptownhall.
'Play Date: Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'
The Sugar Hill Children's Museum of Art & Storytelling hosts a free daylong celebration of Dr. King's legacy. Festivities will begin in the morning with art-making activities focused on the theme of "creating a just world." In the afternoon, a story hour, more art making and an intergenerational dialogue inspired by Dr. King's book "Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?" will follow. Jan. 20 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the museum, 898 St. Nicholas Avenue, Manhattan; 212-335-0004, sugarhillmuseum.org.

Texto completo: Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
COMPAÑÍA IRENE RODRÍGUEZ at the Joyce Theater (Jan. 18, 8 p.m.; Jan. 19, 2 and 8 p.m.; Jan. 20, 2 and 7:30 p.m.). As a child growing up in Havana, Rodríguez would slip out of ballet class to secretly study Spanish dance instead. She rose through the ranks of the Spanish Ballet of Cuba before forming her own company in 2012 to express her brand of contemporary flamenco theater. Rodríguez isn't a purist -- she draws from many forms, including fandango, bolero and Afro-Cuban and contemporary dance -- as evidenced by the title of her Joyce program, "Mas Que Flamenco" ("More Than Flamenco"). She will be joined onstage by an ensemble of dancers, singers and musicians, but her captivating intensity will likely be front and center.

MERCE CUNNINGHAM at Anthology Film Archives (Jan. 21, 7:30 p.m.). As part of this year's extensive celebrations of the centennial of Cunningham's birth, the Anthology presents a weekly screening of his works through Feb. 18. Cunningham, who died in 2009, used technology inventively throughout his career; for the works in this series, the camera is not an impartial observer but an active participant. On Monday, the featured films will be "Fractions I" from 1978, in which four video monitors join dancers onstage, and "Channels/Inserts" from 1982, which employs creative editing and animation techniques. Both were collaborations with the video artist Charles Atlas, who will present the program.
212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org
L-E-V at the Joyce Theater (Jan. 23, 7:30 p.m.; Jan. 24-26, 8 p.m.; through Jan. 27). Two years ago, L-E-V made its Joyce debut with a mesmerizing work, "OCD Love," that called to mind a groovy, erotic, futuristic rave, which is how many of their works come across. Founded in 2013 by Sharon Eyal, a former star of Israel's Batsheva Dance Company, and Gai Behar, a former producer of underground music events, the troupe returns to New York in the coming week with "Love Chapter 2," which explores isolation and loneliness. Once again, the D.J. Ori Lichtik provides a score that shifts from manic to melancholy while L-E-V's seductive performers dance out their demons.
212-242-0800, joyce.org
STEFANIE NELSON DANCEGROUP at Aaron Davis Hall at City College Center for the Arts (Jan. 23, 11 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.). The Moving Memory Project explores memory loss through dementia and Alzheimer's and the impact of those conditions on people and their relationships. To help launch it, Nelson presents "A, My Name Is ...," which draws from her own experience with a family member with dementia. In the work, three performers embody one woman at different stages of her life. The dance performance is paired with short films from the Living With Alzheimer's Film Project, curated by the author David Shenk, who has written about the disease.
212-650-6900, adhatccny.org
NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (Jan. 22-March 3). City Ballet's winter season begins on Tuesday with a week of works by George Balanchine, the company's co-founder and lodestar. Two alternating programs highlight his inspired interpretations of the work of two disparate composers: Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky. The Stravinsky trio, performed on Tuesday, Thursday and the evening of Jan. 26, features "Apollo," "Orpheus" and "Agon," and captures Balanchine's modern sensibility. Meanwhile, the Tchaikovsky set, comprising "Serenade," "Mozartiana" and "Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2" on Wednesday, Jan. 25 and the afternoons of Jan. 26 and 27, shows off his classical elegance.

JEN ROSENBLIT at the Chocolate Factory (Jan. 23-26, 8 p.m.; through Jan. 27). In a previous work by Rosenblit, a giant swath of fuchsia felt exuded enough personality that the New York Times critic Gia Kourlas referred to it as a character in itself. In her new solo, "I'm Gonna Need Another One," Rosenblit again allows colorful inanimate objects to take center stage. Here, green blocks of foam crumble as the work progresses, illustrating Rosenblit's theme of the insubstantial self. She also gets at that dilemma through playful theatricality by adopting alternative personas -- among them, the Greek god Chiron, a wheat farmer and Dorothy from "The Wizard of Oz."

WORKS & PROCESS at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (Jan. 18-20, 7:30 p.m.). The Guggenheim's performance series is serving a tasty dance sandwich this weekend. On Friday and Sunday, Brandon Stirling Baker, the lighting designer for Boston Ballet, will discuss his craft in a program called "Choreography of Light." His work will be on display in excerpts from new ballets by Justin Peck and Alvin Ailey's Jamar Roberts. In between on Saturday, the Houston Ballet artistic director Stanton Welch introduces excerpts from his new production of "Sylvia," a 19th-century ballet about the mythological huntress with a beloved score by Léo Delibes.

How to control the fire hose of news

Texto completo: Having trouble keeping up with news that seems to be flowing out of Washington with even more fire-hose ferocity than usual? If so, you're not alone. Almost seven in 10 Americans (68 percent) feel worn out by the amount of news there is these days, according to a Pew Research Center poll in June.
That was notably higher than the 59 percent who reported feeling exhausted by the high amount of election coverage, compared with 39 percent who said they liked having so much news. That's not surprising, considering how much news President Donald Trump and his administration have produced, much of which they would rather not have made.
Just think, for example, of some of the recent fleeting stories that, in the pre-Trump era, would have dominated headlines for days.
In the past week, for example, The New York Times reported that, shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the bureau launched an investigation to see if the president was working on behalf of the Russian government. He angrily denounced the report and the Times ("Fake news!").
Yet, considering this was about a president who, among other questionable episodes, once cheerfully shared classified documents with Russia's ambassador during a closed-door Oval Office meeting, news of the FBI background probe left me feeling more relieved than shocked. But that news barely sank in before The Washington Post two days later reported that Trump had gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The measures included his taking possession of his translator's notes.
Meanwhile, the longest-running government shutdown in history was closing some offices and holding up thousands of paychecks in an impasse between the president and congressional Democrats over funding of a wall on the Mexican border.
It is worth remembering that Trump had agreed to a bipartisan funding plan but then reneged after he was ridiculed by Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh and some other conservative commentators for breaking his campaign promise of a wall. Sensing his base was crumbling, Trump demanded a wall or nothing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, burned once already, refused to send anything to the Senate floor without Trump's promise to sign it, if it passed.
Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer and his fellow Democrat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, held tight to their "no wall" position in a modified version of Napoleon Bonaparte's advice: Don't interrupt your political rival while he is destroying his own approval ratings.
But, as if the real news were not anxiety-inducing enough, Trump and his enablers held fast to his alternative version of reality. He blamed Democrats for the shutdown after promising earlier to take the blame himself. As for the questions about his Russia relations, he held to his statements that the only election conspiracy with the Russians was not his but that Hillary Clinton's campaign worked with a "deep state" of pro-Clinton FBI agents and others.
All of which reminds me of a Harvard study in 2017 that found China's government pumping almost a half-billion fake comments into Chinese social network posts over a year. The posts in fact did only one thing, the researchers said: "shower praise on all things China." Since the fake posts tended to emerge with events that might stir political unrest, the researchers reasoned that their sole purpose was to distract unhappy citizens from the temptation to organize "by stealing users' time and mental energy."
In similar fashion, the constant stream of tweets and statements from Trump that often have only a passing relationship to facts seems to be aimed at reassuring his base more than winning new converts. Pundits often speak of the "perpetual campaign." Trump is making it a reality.
What can we do about "news anxiety," which many in the psychiatric community say is a real malady, particularly in recent years? If you feel afflicted by it, mental health professionals advise limiting news or social media exposure, especially of the more sensational anxiety-inducing sort.
Psychologist Deborah Serani of Adelphi University, writing in Psychology Today, advised steering yourself away from sensational headlines and cable TV news and toward stories that offer depth, explanations and possible solutions to problems at hand.
That's healthy advice. After reporting the latest scandal or atrocity, it is reassuring to know that there is a rational path out of the problem at hand, if only we can persuade our political leaders to follow it.

Falsey died at 4:56 p.m. Jan. 3 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, according to Johnson County Medical Examiner's office administrative director Clayton Schuneman. He died of blunt force trauma to the head, and his death was ruled an accident. He was 67.
Falsey's brother James told The New York Times last weekend that he died due to injuries sustained during a fall at his Iowa City house. They reported that Falsey had been living in town for the past five years and was writing short stories and a novella.
He was also set to executive produce a new revival of his beloved comedy drama "Northern Exposure," as reported by Variety last November.
Through his work creating, writing and producing television in the 1980s and 1990s, Falsey's shows were praised for mixing eccentric wit and characters with stirring drama that proved to be both critically acclaimed as well as popular.
Along with his creative partner Joshua Brand, Falsey won three Emmy Awards. In 1992, he won for Outstanding Drama Series as a producer of "Northern Exposure," along with Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries or Special for "I'll Fly Away." He and Brand also won an Emmy for Outstanding Miniseries for "A Year in the Life" in 1987.
Falsey graduated from the Iowa Writer's Workshop in 1978, during an era of the workshop that featured the likes of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jane Smiley, science fiction master Joe Haldeman and other Iowa literary luminaries.
Soon after, he started a writing job for "The White Shadow," the Emmy-winning drama starring Ken Howard as a white, former professional basketball player coaching a mostly black city high school.
After "The White Shadow" ended, Falsey and Brand created the medical drama "St. Elsewhere." The show, one of the most acclaimed television dramas of the 20th century, would go on to win 13 Emmy Awards, launched the careers of actors like Denzel Washington and Mark Harmon and showcased one of the most talked-about, and controversial, series finale endings in television history.
The series ended with the titular hospital being shown inside of a snow globe.
TV and film critic Matt Zoller Seitz wrote last year on the 30th anniversary of the "St. Elsewhere's" finale that the show "wove in commentary on the process of writing, producing and airing a television show, and sometimes characters would round a corner and come face-to-face with a metaphor for the creative process." The show ran from 1982 to 1988.
In 1990, Falsey and Brand created "Northern Exposure," a seven-time Emmy Award-winning comedy and drama show centering on a recently graduated doctor who set up his practice in the small fictional town of Cicely, Alaska. The show ran from 1990 to 1995.
Both "I'll Fly Away" and "Northern Exposure" were co-produced by David Chase. Four years after the Alaska-set show ended, Chase created HBO's defining drama "The Sopranos." Fellow UI graduates Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess would go on to win numerous Emmy awards for their work on the hit mafia drama.
Falsey later co-created and produced the Steven Spielberg-backed anthology show "Amazing Stories." The last show Falsey produced was "Providence," a family drama that ran from 1999 to 2004.
Falsey was born in New Haven, Connecticut and graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1975.

Texto completo: WESTBROOK -- Has the incredible spinning disk of ice spun for the last time?
The football field-sized circle of ice rotating in the Presumpscot River was first spotted Monday and has been trumpeted internationally by the BBC, ABC's "Good Morning America" and The New York Times, among others. But when crowds gathered along the river Wednesday to gaze at its mystery and majesty, the ice was motionless. It had lodged against the river's edge and stopped.
"I guess if it's stopped circulating, and it freezes into place, that might be the end of it," said Ryan Breton, a meteorologist at Portland TV station News Center Maine (WCSH/WLBZ). "It's going to get down to about 5 (degrees) tonight (Wednesday) and only get up to about 20 on Thursday. And we could get snow over the weekend, which will weigh it down."
Spinning disks of varying size appear periodically during winter months in colder climates in North America and Europe, and have been the subject of speculation for years, appearing in rivers and streams but never lakes or ponds. A similar spinning disk appeared this month in rural Estonia and has been drawing curious onlookers to the shore of the Vigala River.
Breton, who researched ice disks for a TV report this week, said theories about them usually include the river current and the varying depths of the river as forces that help the ice spin and remain round.
STILL ATTRACTING A CROWD
Recently, research was conducted at the University of Liege in Belgium, where a team led by StÃ©phane Dorbolo showed that temperature changes in the water below a small ice disk could be the source of some of the rotational force. When the water cools to 39.2 degrees, it begins to sink and creates a vortex in the water, producing a small force that spins the ice, researchers said.
Though the disk in Westbrook had stopped moving, it was still drawing crowds Wednesday. It was still perfectly round and looked a lot like a Google Earth shot of our world from above. The public parking lot nearest the river was jammed to capacity around 12:30 p.m. and tiny Ash Street, leading to the best viewing spot, had a steady parade of cars.
Among the crowd of 50 to 60 people who had come to see the disk, talk turned to ways of getting it moving once again.
Vincent Rowe of Portland said he'd volunteer to go down to the riverbank, where the ice had lodged, and stomp on it to set it free. Then he reneged, for fear that he'd crack the 100-yard-wide frozen circle and spoil the magic for everyone.
Patty Fitzpatrick, also of Portland, wondered why some enterprising youngsters in a boat hadn't tried to restore the disk's spinning glory.
"Kids these days have no ambition," Fitzpatrick said.
Allen Vaughan, who lives within sight of the ice disk, didn't see it until Wednesday. His roommate called him and told him Westbrook was on the BBC news. So he decided to walk a few hundred yards from his home and see what all the fuss was about. He said he would have liked to have seen it when it was spinning, but still found its massive, perfectly round shape "fascinating."
MAYOR SAYS IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS
During the days when it was slowly spinning, onlookers and people on social media compared it to a crop circle, a carousel and a "duck-go-round." Ducks didn't seem to mind it being motionless Wednesday, as a half-dozen were resting on it.
Westbrook's mayor, Mike Sanphy, was on "Good Morning America" on Wednesday talking about the possible economic power of the disk.
Sanphy said later Wednesday that as people filter through downtown to see the disk, they can't help but notice how many more shops and restaurants there are compared with a few years ago.
"We've been trying to revitalize the downtown, so anything that brings people in is good for business," he said.
He had heard about a helicopter sightseeing company that had inquired with the city about bringing people on flights over the ice disk. He also said that media from Japan had called about getting a picture of it.
Pat Mahoney, a retired L.L. Bean worker from Gorham, came to see the disk after seeing a live shot of it on ABC's "Good Morning America." When asked if she was disappointed the disk had stopped spinning, Mahoney said, "not in the least."
Others agreed.
"I didn't realize it was so huge, bigger than it looked online," said Pearl McNeil of Portland, who came to see the disk with Fitzpatrick. "It looks like the globe. We saw it on Facebook and thought we should see it. I'm glad we came."

Texto completo: House Democratic leaders appear to have convinced rank-and-file lawmakers to accept Tuesday’s vote to disapprove of comments made to the New York Times by Steve King, R-Iowa, rather than seek a more serious vote to censure the veteran lawmaker.

Reps. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio and Bobby Rush, D-Ill., introduced separate resolutions calling for a vote to censure King for comments he made questioning why "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" were offensive.

But both lawmakers have agreed to refer the censure resolutions to the Ethics Committee, which essentially stops the House from having to vote on the matter.

A censure is rare and serious. It’s just a step below voting whether to expel a member.

King said his comments were taken out of context.

On Wednesday, Rush brought up his resolution to censure King.

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called for the matter to be referred to the ethics panel and it was agreed to without objection from Rush.

Ryan earlier in the day agreed to refer his resolution to the ethics panel as well.

Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., earlier this week stripped King of his committee assignments.

The House approved a resolution of disapproval of King’s comments on Tuesday.

Both parties are wary of taking serious punitive action against each other out of a fear of partisan retaliation.

Successful Aging: Maintaining a positive outlook helps in recovery and good health

Texto completo: I am a 78-year old healthy woman facing a fourth surgery on my leg and am a bit depressed. Fortunately, I’ve recovered well from the previous three. Up until now I have been very active, hiking, traveling, dancing and continuing to work in my career. Several friends who have had recent surgeries tell me I need to get used to doing less and that’s just what I should expect given my age. Their negative outlook is distressing to me. Can you offer a little hope? T.S.
Dear T.S.
Yes, hope is on its way. Let’s look at the reality. We know with age we will experience changes at some point in time. Some might be disease related, others more mechanical such as a joint replacement. We may need more sleep and slow down a bit. Our immune system may not be as efficient. And then there are changes in our vision and hearing. Add to that the loss of muscle mass and flexibility. Many of these normal changes can be postponed with healthy lifestyles.
And part of that healthy lifestyle is our attitude. Here is what we know:
Becca Levy and colleagues from Yale found that those who are optimistic about their age and reject aging stereotypes can extend their life by 7.5 years. This powerful finding takes into account age, gender, wealth and self-reported health and loneliness. This research is based on a study of 660 men and women in Ohio who were followed for over 20 years. Levy found the years they gained from having a positive attitude was more than the years gained from low blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking and regular exercise.
In today’s world, it can be difficult to maintain a positive view of aging as we live in a youth-centric society, particularly in Southern California. On our sunny days we are surrounded by sleek bodies in their beach, running and biking attire. In addition to our culture, preferences for youth over older age are evident in employment, movies, the advertising industry, marketing and more. But the times are slowly changing.
A recent New York Times story (January 9, 2019) headlined “Older and in Power, Unwilling to Remain Unseen” referred to four older women in positions of power: Susan Zirinksy at 66 will take over CBS News in March and is the first woman to do so. Then there is Nancy Pelosi who at 78 was re-elected to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. Representative Maxine Waters at 79 will lead the Financial Services Committee. And Glenn Close at 71 beat out four younger women to win the Golden Globe award for best actress.
Yes, these all are women, which makes their position noteworthy because in general age works against women a little bit more than it does for men. You’ve heard the expression – gray hair on a man is distinguished; on a woman it’s old age. Additionally, women confront two biases: age and gender.
Let’s continue to look at reality. Those who have an illness, particularly chronic ones, may have a hard time being optimistic. Illness is scary, forcing people to deal with uncertainty, lack of control and turning themselves over to doctors. For many there is a realization their life is finite. Being positive all of the time may be unrealistic.
Older adults are resilient. They have lived through wars, divorces, losing a job, relocating, financial concerns, illness and then spring back. Jonathan Rauch, author of “The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50” writes that older people feel less stress and regret; they dwell less on negative information and are better able to regulate their emotions. As a result, older adults are reported to be happier in their later years. Clearly difficult events continue to occur; it’s their response to the events that changes over time.
Although I am in no position to judge your current situation, it sounds as though your problem is likely fixable, given you have recovered well from your previous leg surgeries. Yet there is always uncertainty.
There is hope. Your ongoing positive outlook and resilience should serve you well. As to your friends, you might mention that everyone is a case of one – and in your case you are planning for a full recovery and resuming your active life. I feel confident that you will do everything possible to make that happen.

House condemns white nationalism, supremacy

Texto completo: -- The House voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to condemn white nationalism and white supremacy, a measure prompted by the comments of Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who openly questioned why those terms had become offensive.
Having been stripped of his committee assignments Monday and facing further reproach, King went to the House floor Tuesday to say that he would support the resolution while continuing to protest that he had been misquoted in The New York Times article.
"There is no tape for this interview I did. There's no way to go back and listen," he said, conceding that he might have said the quoted words but challenging how they have been interpreted. "That ideology never showed up in my head. I don't know how it would have come out of my mouth."
The resolution, introduced by House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., mentions King's remarks in its preamble, but the measure does not directly rebuke King himself. It passed 424-1, with Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., voting no because he favors a censure of King.
Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American congressional leader, called white nationalism and white supremacy "clear and present dangers to our great Republic," in floor remarks Tuesday.
"When elected representatives give cover and comfort to those who spread racial divisiveness, we embolden those on the fringes on our society, and we have seen some of the results," he said citing the hate-motivated murders of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., and synagogue attendees in Pittsburgh.
King sat apart from his colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle as Clyburn spoke. Moments later, King rose, made the sign of the cross, and descended into the well of the House to give his remarks.
King said he came from a family of abolitionists, before ultimately calling on his colleagues to support a measure that is intended to serve as a serious admonition against him.
"All men and all women are created equal," he said. "It is in my heart, it is in my soul, and it is in my works."
But those words came too late for his own Republican colleagues, not to mention scores of Democrats who are ready to pursue more serious actions against King, including censure -- the most serious House sanction short of expulsion.
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, called Tuesday for King to "find another line of work," a day after GOP leaders moved to punish King by stripping him of his committee assignments and King earned a rebuke from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., condemned King's comments but stopped short of calling for his resignation.
"I think that's up to Steve King," he said.
Some Democrats are pressing for further punishment. Two Democrats have filed censure resolutions that are set to see floor action by Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., praised Republican leaders for their action but left open the possibility that he would vote for a censure resolution.
Hoyer exploded when asked how King's behavior compared to the last House member to be censured, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
King's conduct, he said, "far exceeds" Rangel's actions, which included improperly using his office to solicit funds and failing to pay taxes on a vacation home. Hoyer served as majority leader during Rangel's 2010 ethics proceedings and pushed to reprimand Rangel, a lesser punishment than censure.
"What King is doing and what others have done is to encourage the undermining of the basic principles of our country," he said.<

Texto completo: She used to be known mostly for her vice presidential family lineage. But Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-most senior House Republican, is cutting a new path as the first GOP leader to call Rep. Steve King's remarks "racist" and call explicitly for his resignation.
Cheney on Twitter denounced King's recent quote in the New York Times.
"These comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse," she tweeted Jan. 10. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and House GOP Whip Steve Scalise likewise condemned King's remarks. The House on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to formally rebuke King. But Cheney is the only one of the three to call for King's resignation.
The only lawmaker to vote no was Illinois Democrat Bobby Rush, who wanted a stronger censure against King. But even he has noticed Cheney, in a good way.
"Liz Cheney, I commend her," Rush said.
"She was very clear," about what how she wanted to handle the King issue, McCarthy said.
Clear is the word on the two-term Wyoming congresswoman - an attorney, mother of four and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.
Even before she was elected to the leadership post for Congress, Cheney was clear about what she saw as the party's need for a quicker, more forceful communications strategy.
"We've got to change the way that we operate, and really in some ways be more aggressive, have more of a rapid response," Cheney told the AP in November.
Cheney's father won the conference chair more than 30 years ago after four terms as Wyoming's congressman. By landing the position after just one term, Cheney left little doubt that she's a rising political star in her own right.
"He told me not to screw it up," Cheney said.

Texto completo: "This body must speak out against this evil."
Rep. James Clyburn
D-S.C.
WASHINGTON – The House nearly unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday condemning Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, for questioning why phrases such as "white supremacist" are offensive.
King voted for the resolution himself. It passed 424 to 1.
Before the vote, King said he agreed with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn's resolution, titled "Rejecting White nationalism and White supremacy." The resolution invoked King's comments and condemned such words as "hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States."
"I regret that we are in this place," King said, adding that he rejects such ideologies. "I agree with every word that you have put in this. It's an honest and a direct resolution put together to address a subject that has been too long before the public dialogue in this country.
"I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's vote for this resolution. I'm putting up a yes on the board here," King said.
He said his "white supremacist" comments had not come across as he intended.
King sat alone on the GOP side of the chamber as Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, urged his colleagues to support the resolution. A handful of Republicans sat nearby. Many stood up to condemn racism.
On the other side of the aisle, about two dozen Democrats sat in rapt silence as Clyburn, a civil rights veteran, invoked the work of Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday was Tuesday.
"Now is the time to do right," Clyburn said before the vote. "This body must speak out against this evil."
The sole "no" vote came from Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., an African-American, who said the measure did not go far enough.
Minimally, King should be censured, Rush said Tuesday, and if he continues making such remarks, he should be expelled from Congress.
"Steve King has made a career out of being a racist, and he needs to be called out as such," he said.
The vote followed a series of condemnations from lawmakers in both parties. A handful of prominent Republicans said King should leave Congress, and top House Republicans voted Monday not to assign King any committees in the new Congress. King was on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business Committees.
He had been the chairman of the immigration and border security subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee when Republicans controlled the House.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?" King said in an interview with The New York Times last week. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
"The House Republicans denounce his language. We do not believe in his language, and we've decided that he will not serve on any" committees, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Tuesday. He said it was up to King whether he should resign.
Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the No. 3 House Republican, went further, echoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: "I think that he should find another line of work," she said. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, also called on King to resign.
Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, 235-199, with the help of a coalition of women, African-Americans and Hispanics. They ushered in the most diverse class yet, breaking records for the number of women and minorities. The House GOP became less diverse, seeing a decline in the number of women and the loss of the sole African-American Republican woman in the House, Mia Love of Utah.
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., applauded Republican leaders for their "strong" actions against King on Tuesday. "I think they did the right thing," he said. "I think they're very concerned about their party being perceived as a Steve King party."
Hoyer said the party was discussing two measures that would censure King – one by Rush and a more narrow one from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio – acknowledging that such actions could open a Pandora's box. "It is a big deal to be censured," he said.
Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce, the first Republican to join Ryan's censure resolution and a member of the steering committee that stripped King of his committees, told USA TODAY he tried to have a "man-to-man" conversation with King when he "made stupid comments" about immigrants in 2013.
"My point was that when you say stupid things, it splashes on all of us," Joyce said. "He said, well, he gets good publicity out of it. I said, 'Well you need to think about other people here because it's not right.'"

U-M's firing of gymnastics consultant isn't so simple

Texto completo: Whose voice counts?
It's a question that should have been asked the many times girls and young women expressed concerns about Larry Nassar and his "treatments," only to be ignored, chastised or told, patronizingly, that they must be mistaken.
And it's a question that should be asked now, as the gymnastics community tries to put itself back together and find a way forward.
The University of Michigan announced Sunday night that it was canceling its contract with Rhonda Faehn, whom it had hired three days earlier as a consultant for its women's gymnastics team. In her previous job, as women's program director at USA Gymnastics, Faehn was the federation's first top-level official to learn of gymnasts' complaints about Nassar.
The hiring infuriated some Nassar survivors, who say Faehn didn't do enough to protect gymnasts. Faehn said during congressional testimony that she'd been told three gymnasts were "uncomfortable" with Nassar and his treatments. Though she immediately forwarded the concerns to her boss, then-CEO and president Steve Penny, who told her repeatedly that he had alerted authorities, she did not go to law enforcement herself.
But the hiring had also been cleared, and cheered, by other survivors.
"Please remember that a few of us on this team were affected by Nassar and if we can stand up and say we are happy to have Rhonda with us, then you can be happy for us. It's a shame social media has such power and nobody is listening to the athletes yet again. Please reconsider!" Polina Shchennikova, now a student assistant coach at Michigan after an injury forced her to retire last fall, said on Twitter.
The tweet was retweeted by several Michigan gymnasts, as were other tweets asking why the wishes of the athletes — survivors — were being ignored.
There was a similar outcry from athletes when Faehn was suddenly fired by USA Gymnastics in May.
"If we are the ones that you are 'protecting' then why are you getting rid of the people who actually care about us?" Margzetta Frazier said in a text message to then-CEO Kerry Perry, a screenshot of which she briefly posted on social media.
So, again, whose voice counts? Are we to somehow parcel out who suffered more and judge their opinions accordingly? Are we going to proudly stand in support of some women while telling others that their feelings and concerns are unimportant and not worthy of being heard? Again?
There is no shortage of blame to go around for Nassar being allowed to prey on girls and young women for 20-plus years. But some are more culpable than others.
The coaches and administrators at Michigan State who ignored athletes' complaints, for example. The police and prosecutors who did not thoroughly investigate multiple allegations over the years. The medical professionals who did not raise alarms after hearing, and in some cases seeing, that Nassar was performing "treatments" that no teenager or early-20 something could possibly need and that obviously constituted abuse.
What, however, do we do with the rest? The others who, in hindsight, it's obvious could and should have done more.
Though Faehn told Penny about the athletes' concerns in June 2015, USA Gymnastics waited five weeks while it did its own investigation. It then told the FBI, which, for reasons that are still unexplained, did nothing with the report for almost a year. No one alerted Michigan State, where Nassar was still working, or the Michigan gyms where he saw individual athletes.
Only after Rachael Denhollander and another athlete, later identified as 2000 Olympian Jamie Dantzscher, told their stories to The Indianapolis Star in September 2016 did Nassar's horrors become public.
The New York Times reported last year that it had identified at least 40 girls and women who were abused between June 2015 and September 2016. That's as heartbreaking as it is enraging.
But if Faehn is to be ostracized for her inaction, how far does the moral outrage extend? To the personal coaches, who also knew and didn't go to authorities? To the parents, who, either out of trust that something was being done, concern for their daughters or a combination of both, did not report Nassar either?
Attorney John Manly and some survivors have made the case that the culpability is Faehn's because she was a mandatory reporter under Indiana law. But when a child's life and well-being are at stake, shouldn't we all be mandatory reporters?
At least Faehn has cooperated with investigations by Congress and Ropes & Gray, and it was her testimony at a June hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee that revealed Penny had had medical records removed from the Karolyi ranch.
There is no way to undo the vast damage Nassar did. But there are lessons to be learned, foremost being that groupthink is toxic and when people speak out, they must be heard.
Whose voice counts?
They all should.

William Barr: 7 things to watch at Senate confirmation hearing for Trump's AG pick

Resumen: William Barr's position on Robert Mueller's investigation is one of several things to watch for at his Senate hearing to become attorney general

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear Tuesday from William Barr, President Donald Trump’s nominee to become attorney general. Here are seven things to watch for at the hearing:
1. Mueller investigation
Barr wrote a memo in June about Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller pursuing a possible obstruction of justice charge against Trump, arguing the probe was “fatally misconceived. ”
Senate Democrats plan to press Barr on whether he will support the Mueller probe.
“I want to make sure that (Barr) is not going to take the position that he should just protect Trump at all costs,” Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, told USA TODAY. “I want to hear from him that the attorney general’s office is an independent entity. ”
Barr said in a copy of his testimony released Monday that Mueller should be allowed to complete his work. Barr said the memo was written about a narrow obstruction-of-justice statute rather than about the special counsel's authority more broadly.
“I can assure you that, where judgments are to be made by me, I will make those judgments based solely on the law and will let no personal, political, or other improper interests influence my decision,” Barr said.

2. Trump and Russia
The FBI began not just a criminal investigation before Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, but a counterintelligence probe, according to a report in The New York Times.
Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del. , said the report suggests there may have been more concerns that sparked the Mueller investigation than were publicly known at the time. Coons told reporters Monday he will focus during on whether Barr “will stand up for the rule of law and the appropriate independence of the Department of Justice.
Trump has repeatedly criticized the Mueller probe as a "witch hunt" and denied colluding with Russia to win the election.
“I never worked for Russia,” Trump said Monday. "Not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question because it's a whole big, fat hoax. "
3. Executive power
Barr, who was attorney general from November 1991 to January 1993 and earlier served as deputy attorney general and headed the Office of Legal Counsel, holds an expansive view of the president’s executive power.
In the legal counsel job, Barr wrote opinions that justified the FBI arresting fugitives overseas and the invasion of Panama and arrest of dictator Manuel Noriega. As deputy attorney general, Barr told former President George H. W. Bush he had the authority to attack Iraq without congressional approval.
Barr could face an early test of executive authority if he is confirmed because Trump has threatened to proclaim a national emergency to shift funding from other departments to build the wall along the southern border.
“I think it’s important to know what kind of judgment the attorney general nominee might provide for the president on the scope of his power," Coons said.
Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. , said he was sure Barr would be asked "about his opinion about the relationship between Justice and the other parts of the executive branch, including but not limited to the office of the presidency. "
4. Partisan clashes
The hearing comes amid significant turnover in Trump's Cabinet, with acting secretaries at the Justice, Defense, Interior departments, along with White House chief of staff and head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Justice Department has a role in developing administration policy over a variety of hot-button issues, including immigration and voting rights.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said several Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are running for president and "have demonstrated that they will treat almost anything like a political circus. " Cruz himself is a former 2016 presidential candidate.
Coons said tensions linger from the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which he called "one of the most divisive and charged hearings" during his eight years in the Senate. But Barr helped himself by releasing a statement that answered questions and addressed concerns, Coons said.
“It is my hope that everyone will conduct themselves in appropriate, professional ways," Coons said.
5. Criminal justice policy
Lawmakers are expected to press Barr on a criminal-justice overhaul, which in part would give judges more discretion in sentencing. His predecessor, Jeff Sessions, had been an advocate of harsh punishment, directing prosecutors to seek the toughest charges possible.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. , said she wants to ask about department initiatives such as criminal-justice overhaul, immigration, human trafficking and opioids.
In his prepared testimony, Barr said the crime rate has fallen substantially since he last last served as attorney general in 1992, when his priority was to target violent offenders and gangs. Barr said the First Step Act, the name for the overhaul legislation, recognizes the progress made and he said he would diligently implement it.
"I believe we must keep up the pressure on chronic, violent criminals," Barr said. "We cannot allow the progress we have made to be reversed. "
6. Immigration
Barr will testify during a partial shutdown of the federal government – at more than three weeks, the longest in history. Trump and congressional Democrats are at a stalemate over immigration policy, with the president insisting on $5. 7 billion for construction of a wall along the southern border.
Barr said in his prepared testimony that immigration has been a huge benefit, but that the country couldn't accommodate many millions of people who would come from poorer countries if there were no restrictions.
"In short, in order to ensure that our immigration system works properly, we must secure our nation's borders, and we must ensure that our laws allow us to process, hold and remove those who unlawfully enter," Barr said.
7. Justice Dept. morale problems
Barr could face questions about sagging morale at the Department of Justice, which has been a target of Trump’s criticism for the past two years.
Trump fired his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, the day after the midterm election in November after sharply criticizing him for recusing himself from the Mueller investigation. Trump has also blasted FBI repeatedly for corrupt and incompetent leadership and investigators.
Barr said in his prepared remarks that he would protect the department's integrity.
"Above all else, if confirmed, I will work diligently to protect the professionalism and integrity of the department as an institution, and I will strive to leave it, and the nation, a stronger and better place," Barr said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Congressional Democrats Sunday pledged heightened scrutiny of President Donald Trump's dealings with Russia, spurred by news reports of extraordinary secrecy surrounding his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the opening in 2017 of an FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump worked on behalf of the Kremlin.
Trump's Republican allies in Congress and his administration defended him, impugning the motives of federal investigators, insisting the White House had been tough on Russia, and denouncing as "ludicrous" any suggestion that Trump had been compromised by Moscow.
The intensifying Russia-related furor coincides with a partial government shutdown that pushed over the weekend into a record-breaking fourth week. More than three-quarters of a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay. They missed their first paychecks of 2019 last week.
There was little sign of any imminent breakthrough in ending the shutdown, whose effects are being more broadly felt with each passing week.
Trump spent Sunday morning demanding on Twitter that Congress allocate funds for building a wall on the border with Mexico, a project Democrats vehemently oppose.
Trump called into a conservative talk show on Saturday to denounce a New York Times report that in 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was acting as an agent for Russia.
Asked on Fox News whether he had ever "worked for Russia," Trump fumed, but did not take the opportunity to directly respond to the query.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked - I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written," he said.
On Sunday news shows, several leading congressional Democrats expressed deepening concerns over Trump and Russia, after the New York Times report and a Washington Post story about Trump's efforts to conceal what was said in meetings with Putin over the last two years.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said on "Fox News Sunday" that word of a counterintelligence investigation was "alarming," and that it showed the need for the wide-ranging Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller to proceed unimpeded.
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that opening a counterintelligence investigation on a sitting president shows the FBI must have had a "very deep level of concern."
With a new Democratic majority in the House, freshly anointed committee chairmen are pledging to use their expanded powers to look into Trump and Russia, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and sensitive documents.
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., who now heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his panel would hold hearings about what he called Trump's "bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies."
In a statement issued Saturday night, Engel suggested that secrecy about what was said when Trump met with the Russian leader - to the extent of keeping his national security team in the dark - was of paramount concern.
"Every time Trump meets with Putin, the country is told nothing," Engel said. "America deserves the truth, and the Foreign Affairs Committee will seek to get to the bottom of it."
Republican allies of the president said the acts of concealment described by the Post, including Trump's demand that an interpreter hand over the U.S. side's only notes of a private meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, were well within his authority.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said on CNN's "State of the Union" that "this is not a traditional president."
"He has unorthodox means," Johnson said. "But he is president of the United States. It's pretty much up to him in terms of who he wants to read in to his conversations with world leaders."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats had been stymied in previous efforts to learn what was said between Trump and Putin during a summit last year in Helsinki, Finland - but signaled that was about to change.
"Last year, we sought to obtain the interpreter's notes or testimony, from the private meeting between Trump and Putin," he said in a statement. "The Republicans on our committee voted us down. Will they join us now?"
Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, said, "Shouldn't we find out whether our president is really putting 'America first?' "

Trump's weekend: new Russia questions, shutdown irritants

Texto completo: WASHINGTON (AP) - It wasn't the weekend that President Donald Trump wanted: largely alone at the White House, irked by a pair of startling Russia headlines and baffled that he's not getting more credit for staying put during the partial government shutdown.
Trump surprised his aides by deciding, with just a few hours' notice, to call in to Jeanine Pirro's show on Fox News on Saturday night to push back against coverage of his presidency on multiple fronts, particularly published reports about his approach toward Russia.
Even then, the president avoided directly answering when Pirro asked whether he currently is or has ever worked for Russia. The question came after The New York Times reported that law enforcement officials began investigating, in 2017, whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests. The newspaper said the investigation came after the president's firing of FBI Director James Comey.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked," Trump told Pirro, a personal friend. "I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing."
Trump went on to assert that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.
"If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other ... probably any other president, period, but certainly the last three or four presidents," he said.
White House aides expressed regret that the president did not more clearly and forcefully deny being a Russian agent when asked by the usually friendly Fox News host, according to three White House aides and Republicans close to the White House. The three spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.
Trump also objected to a report in The Washington Post that said he went to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin even from high-ranking officials in his own administration. The report cited unnamed current and former U.S. officials.
In the Fox News interview, Trump questioned why the newspaper made such a "big deal" out of his discussions with Putin in Helsinki last summer. "Anybody could have listened to that meeting, that meeting is up for grabs."
The Russia reports came as Trump plays up his presence at the White House during the standoff with Democrats over funding for his long-promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Large swaths of the government have been shut down for weeks while Trump and Democrats in Congress remain at an impasse over money for the border wall.
Trump has been trying to play up his presence at the White House during the standoff as a sign that it's Democrats who won't negotiate a deal.
"I like the symbol of me being here," Trump told Pirro. "I like that symbol because I am ready to sign. And they're not. And they're not."
Trump has expressed bafflement that he is not getting more credit for largely staying put during the shutdown. Aides acknowledge that the West Wing mishandled the first few days of the shutdown, when Trump remained out of sight, and are now trying to use the trappings of his office, with an Oval Office speech, a visit to the Texas border and the president's frequent tweets about waiting in the White House for Democrats to act.
By Sunday night, a blanket of snow in Washington seemed to provide a calming backdrop for the discontented president. He tweeted: "Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden. Really is something - SPECIAL COUNTRY, SPECIAL PLACE!"
Trump's claim that he's been tough on Russia was disputed Sunday by Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. The senator said almost all the sanctions on Russia arose not in the White House but in Congress, due to concerns by members of both parties about Moscow's actions. Warner accused the White House of being very slow to put in place the penalties.
The Times reported that FBI agents and some top officials became suspicious of Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign but didn't open an investigation at that time because they weren't sure how to approach such a sensitive probe.
Trump's behavior in the days around Comey's May 2017 firing helped trigger the counterintelligence part of the probe, according to the newspaper.
In the inquiry, counterintelligence investigators sought to evaluate whether Trump was a potential threat to national security. They also sought to determine whether Trump was deliberately working for Russia or had unintentionally been influenced by Moscow.
Trump tweeted early Saturday that the report showed that the FBI leadership "opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof" after he had fired Comey.
Robert Mueller took over the investigation when he was appointed special counsel soon after Comey's firing. The overall investigation is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with the Russians, as well as possible obstruction of justice by Trump. The Times says it's unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence angle.
Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Times he had no knowledge of the counterintelligence inquiry but said that since it was opened a year and a half ago and they hadn't heard anything, apparently "they found nothing."

Texto completo: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump avoided directly answering when asked whether he currently is or has ever worked for Russia after a published report said law enforcement officials, concerned about his behavior after he fired FBI Director James Comey in 2017, had begun investigating that possibility.
Trump said it was the "most insulting" question he had ever been asked.
The New York Times report Friday cited unnamed former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
Trump responded to the story Saturday during a telephone interview broadcast on Fox News Channel after host Jeanine Pirro, a personal friend, asked the Russia question.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked," Trump said. "I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing."
Trump never answered Pirro directly, but went on to assert that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.
"If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other ... probably any other president, period, but certainly the last three or four presidents."
Trump's claim was disputed by Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He said almost all the sanctions on Russia arose not in the White House but in Congress, due to concerns by members of both parties about Moscow's actions. Warner accused the White House of being very slow to put in place the penalties.
The Times reported that FBI agents and some top officials became suspicious of Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign but didn't open an investigation at that time because they weren't sure how to approach such a sensitive probe.
Trump's behavior in the days around Comey's May 2017 firing helped trigger the counterintelligence part of the probe, according to the newspaper.
In the inquiry, counterintelligence investigators sought to evaluate whether Trump was a potential threat to national security. They also sought to determine whether Trump was deliberately working for Russia or had unintentionally been influenced by Moscow.
Trump tweeted early Saturday that the report showed that the FBI leadership "opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof" after he had fired Comey.
Robert Mueller took over the investigation when he was appointed special counsel soon after Comey's firing.
The overall investigation is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with the Russians, as well as possible obstruction of justice by Trump. The Times says it's unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence angle.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said the report "may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place." He and other Democratic senators said this report and others within the past week questioning Trump's behavior toward Russia give new urgency to the need for the Mueller investigation to be allowed to run its course.
A new report in The Washington Post said Trump went to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin even from high-ranking officials in his own administration. The report cited unnamed current and former U.S. officials.
In the Fox News interview, Trump questioned why the newspaper made such a "big deal" out of his discussions with Putin in Helsinki last summer. "Anybody could have listened to that meeting, that meeting is up for grabs."
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., defended the president, who he said was "burned earlier by leaks of other private conversations."
Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Times he had no knowledge of the counterintelligence inquiry but said that since it was opened a year and a half ago and they hadn't heard anything, apparently "they found nothing."
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is close to Trump and chairs the Judiciary Committee, said he intends to ask the FBI director if there was a counterintelligence investigation into the president. "If this really did happen, Congress needs to know about it and what I want to do is make sure how could the FBI do that?"
Trump has repeatedly and vociferously denied collusion with the Russians.
Also Sunday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he will force a vote in the coming days on the Treasury Department's decision to ease sanctions on three companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week defended the decision, saying the companies are undergoing a major restructuring to "sever Deripaska's control and significantly diminish his ownership." He saids Deripaska himself and any companies he controls remain under sanctions.
Schumer, however, contends the Russian oligarch maintains significant influence on these companies, including the aluminum manufacturing giant Rusal, and said it's important the sanctions remain in place while Mueller's investigation proceeds. Deripaska has figured into the investigation due to his ties to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
Warner predicted some Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate would join Democrats in voting to override the removal of these sanctions.
Warner and Johnson spoke on CNN's "State of the Union," while Coons and Graham appeared on "Fox News Sunday."

The decision to hold a vote came on the same night GOP leadership voted not to give committee assignments to King. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters the Republican steering committee voted unanimously not to assign King, who has been in Congress since 2003, to any positions on House committees.
“Steve’s remarks are beneath the dignity of the Party of Lincoln and the United States of America. His comments call into question whether he will treat all Americans equally, without regard for race and ethnicity," McCarthy said. "House Republicans are clear: We are all in this together, as fellow citizens equal before God and the law. "
King was previously on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business committees and served as chairman of the immigration and border security subcommittee.
Opinion: JD Scholten: Here's how I nearly beat Steve King and here's why he keeps winning. So far.

Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders are coalescing behind a vote of disapproval being considered by Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, the aide said.
"I rise today to address what I will call a tale of two kings. One, a member of this body, who wondered out loud to the New York Times why the terms white nationalism and white supremacy are offensive," Clyburn, who is black, will say on the House floor according to an excerpt of his remarks. "I would say to my colleague that the terms are offensive because the concepts are evil.
"I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in breaking the deafening silence and letting our resounding condemnation be heard. "
Earlier Monday, two House Democrats introduced resolutions to formally censure King, a stronger step than a vote of disapproval, although both are formal rebukes from the chamber.
Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. , and Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, both proposed censure resolutions.
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?” King said in an interview with the New York Times last week. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”
King has sought to tamp down the controversy over his comments about white supremacy, saying: "I want to make one thing abundantly clear; I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define. ”
In a statement on Monday, King vowed to stay in office, describing McCarthy's decision as an assault on his freedom of speech.
"Ultimately, I told him, ‘You have to do what you have to do and I will do what I have to do,'" King said. "I will continue to point out the truth and work with all the vigor that I have to represent 4th District Iowans for at least the next two years. "
The resolution of disapproval is similar to the one passed in 2009 for Rep. Joe Wilson, also led by Clyburn. Wilson, a South Carolina Republican, had shouted “You lie!" at then-President Barack Obama during a speech in front of Congress. The following week the Democratic-controlled House passed a resolution of disapproval, largely on party-lines.
Rush said King has "become too comfortable with proudly insulting, disrespecting, and denigrating people of color. "
"As with any animal that is rabid, Steve King should be set aside and isolated,” Rush said in a statement Monday. Rush's censure resolution is "privileged" which means it must come to the floor either for a vote or be tabled by leadership.
Rush "firmly believes anything short of censure would be shallow," a statement from his office said.
A censure resolution would require that King go to the well of the House and listen as a statement of disapproval is read, while the resolution of disapproval would not.
Many of King's colleagues, including Republicans, have criticized his comments.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released a scathing statement on Monday: "Rep. King’s statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. If he doesn’t understand why ‘white supremacy’ is offensive, he should find another line of work. "
Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah called King's comments "reprehensible" and called on him to resign. King already faces Republican primary challengers, including state Sen. Randy Feenstra.
"These comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse," Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the House GOP conference chair tweeted.
Sen. Tim Scott, R-S. C. , the only black Republican in the Senate, wrote a Washington Post op-ed titled: "Why are Republicans accused of racism? Because we’re silent on things like this. "
King has made other comments that have stirred outrage. In 2013, King said Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who came to the U. S. as children, were involved in drug smuggling.
“For every one who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there that weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” King told Newsmax in 2013.
He was abandoned by the House Republican campaign arm going into the 2018 election over alleged ties to white nationalist groups. He narrowly won his election in his deep red district.
On Monday morning, President Donald Trump said he was not familiar with comments from King.
"Who?" Trump asked after a reporter asked him about King's recent comments. After the question was reiterated, Trump responded, "I haven't been following. "

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Congressional Democrats Sunday pledged heightened scrutiny of President Donald Trump's dealings with Russia, spurred by news reports of extraordinary secrecy surrounding his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the opening in 2017 of an FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump worked on behalf of the Kremlin.
Trump's Republican allies in Congress and his administration defended him, impugning the motives of federal investigators, insisting the White House had been tough on Russia, and denouncing as "ludicrous" any suggestion that Trump had been compromised by Moscow.
The intensifying Russia-related furor coincides with a partial government shutdown that pushed over the weekend into a record-breaking fourth week. More than three-quarters of a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay. They missed their first paychecks of 2019 last week.
There was little sign of any imminent breakthrough in ending the shutdown, whose effects are being more broadly felt with each passing week.
Trump spent Sunday morning demanding on Twitter that Congress allocate funds for building a wall on the border with Mexico, a project Democrats vehemently oppose.
Trump called into a conservative talk show on Saturday to denounce a New York Times report that in 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was acting as an agent for Russia.
Asked on Fox News whether he had ever "worked for Russia," Trump fumed, but did not take the opportunity to directly respond to the query.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked - I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written," he said.
On Sunday news shows, several leading congressional Democrats expressed deepening concerns over Trump and Russia, after the New York Times report and a Washington Post story about Trump's efforts to conceal what was said in meetings with Putin over the last two years.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said on "Fox News Sunday" that word of a counterintelligence investigation was "alarming," and that it showed the need for the wide-ranging Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller to proceed unimpeded.
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that opening a counterintelligence investigation on a sitting president shows the FBI must have had a "very deep level of concern."
With a new Democratic majority in the House, freshly anointed committee chairmen are pledging to use their expanded powers to look into Trump and Russia, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and sensitive documents.
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., who now heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his panel would hold hearings about what he called Trump's "bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies."
In a statement issued Saturday night, Engel suggested that secrecy about what was said when Trump met with the Russian leader - to the extent of keeping his national security team in the dark - was of paramount concern.
"Every time Trump meets with Putin, the country is told nothing," Engel said. "America deserves the truth, and the Foreign Affairs Committee will seek to get to the bottom of it."
Republican allies of the president said the acts of concealment described by the Post, including Trump's demand that an interpreter hand over the U.S. side's only notes of a private meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, were well within his authority.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said on CNN's "State of the Union" that "this is not a traditional president."
"He has unorthodox means," Johnson said. "But he is president of the United States. It's pretty much up to him in terms of who he wants to read in to his conversations with world leaders."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats had been stymied in previous efforts to learn what was said between Trump and Putin during a summit last year in Helsinki, Finland - but signaled that was about to change.
"Last year, we sought to obtain the interpreter's notes or testimony, from the private meeting between Trump and Putin," he said in a statement. "The Republicans on our committee voted us down. Will they join us now?"
Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, said, "Shouldn't we find out whether our president is really putting 'America first?' "
Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo, who is traveling in the Middle East, dismissed the possibility that Trump acted on Russia's behalf, calling it an "absolutely ludicrous" notion.
"The idea that's contained in the New York Times story, that President Trump was a threat to American national security, is silly on its face, and not worthy of a response," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation."
The ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, said it was "curious" that as investigations were beginning in 2017, "you had Vladimir Putin policies almost being parroted by Donald Trump."

There is no need to fear stocks

Texto completo: Still scared by the last few months' scary stories? Relax. My last three columns explained why 2018's stock market disappointment supports a V-shaped rebound and a happy, profit-rich 2019. Yet many worry this time is different. Do you?
If so, consider this: Without global recession, a long bear market is super unlikely. Two negative years in a row have never happened without a worldwide recession or global war. To foresee that risk, consider the Conference Board's fantastic Leading Economic Indexes (LEIs) and global purchasing managers' indexes (PMIs). They currently presage global expansion.
LEI combines 10 forward-looking economic indicators into one super-accurate predictor of future growth (or recession). Components include such items as factory orders, credit availability, and, most telling, the yield curve spread (see my July 22 column on yield curve).
No U.S. recession has started while U.S. LEI was high and rising. It always fell for months beforehand. If recession were nigh, LEI would warn us. Now it screams growth. It's high and rising – up 18 of the past 20 months.
Not just here! The Conference Board runs LEIs for 11 other countries, the eurozone and the world. Its eurozone LEI remains in a long uptrend. Ditto for China, India, Korea and the world. Britain's is down, but its weakness comes from sentiment-based components, bashed by Brexit fears. Britain's fundamental components point positively.
Combining LEIs with monthly PMI surveys adds belts to your forecasting suspenders. PMIs estimate what percentage of a country's businesses grew. If PMI tops 50, more than half grew, implying monthly economic growth. If under 50, then contraction.
Don't fixate on any one country – even America. Instead, scope out the biggest chunks of global GDP. Like America, 24.4 percent of the world. Or the 28-country eurozone, 15.9 percent. Add China (16.1 percent), Japan (5.9 percent), Britain and India (3.2 percent each) – and you'll have enough.
December PMIs just came in – showing growth in nearly all major nations. U.S. manufacturing PMI was 54.1. Nonmanufacturing – the vast majority of GDP – hit 57.6. Britain's manufacturing (54.2), service (51.2) and construction (52.8) PMIs also showed growth. Every major European country reached or exceeded 50 except France (where "yellow vest" protests disrupted business – a one-off). Otherwise, growth!
China's manufacturing PMI is below 50, but barely.
The global economy doesn't need – and seldom has – all countries growing at similarly strong rates. It's about areas of strength outweighing weak spots. Today, the strength far outweighs weakness. Yet sentiment presumes the reverse, setting up big positive surprise potential as recession doesn't happen. Of course, stocks don't typically move for long in a perfectly straight line.
But fathom global growth, and believe in the V!

Texto completo: Eastport is the easternmost city in the United States and the smallest city in Maine. Its 1,300 residents are connected to the mainland by a causeway.
But don't mistake its isolation for detachment.
"We may be geographically isolated, but we don't let that define us," said Gregory Biss, chairman of the Eastport Arts Center. "We consider ourselves part of the world, and we want to demonstrate that and live that."
Toward that end, the Eastport Arts Center will host New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for a talk on Saturday afternoon that serves as a fundraiser for the tiny arts center, which provides year-round programming in a former Baptist church that was built soon after Maine became a state.
De Blasio's 92-year-old aunt, Jean Wilhelm, lives in Eastport and is active at the arts center and with the community theater that performs there, Stage East. The mayor of New York will be in town to celebrate Wilhelm's birthday, which was Jan. 10.
De Blasio is known for his tall frame - he stands 6 feet 5 inches - progressive politics and loyalty to his aunt. He's a frequent visitor, and came to Eastport for a birthday visit and similar fundraising talk a year ago. "He called me about a month ago and said he was coming to town again for her birthday, and would we be interested in having a similar event," Biss said. "I said, 'Twist my arm a little harder, please.' "
He's going to talk about progressive politics in the half-century since the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
Wilhelm said her nephew fell in love with Eastport after he began visiting her when she retired there more than a decade ago.
"He's been just terrific to me all my life, so it was sort of natural that he would come visit after I moved here," she said in a phone interview Saturday. "He fell in love with the place just as I did. Eastport is a remarkable town, full of an interesting array of people, lots of whom like me have come from other places, but also loads of people who have lived here all their lives and are firmly rooted. It's a nice combination."
The mayor of New York travels with a security detail. That amuses Wilhelm. "It's quite hilarious. He and I go off and do our things, and there are always these mysterious vehicles following us," she said. "He likes to just get out and walk around and talk to people. He's a great guy. I am so impressed with him as a human being. It's a nice feeling."
The celebrity of the guest aside, de Blasio's appearance is a big deal for the arts center, which has an annual budget of about $150,000. The arts center will raise at least $3,000 from de Blasio's talk, and more if people are generous. The arts center can seat about 125 people and is asking for a minimum donation of $25 per person, up to $100. Ten seats are being reserved for students for $15 each.
"This will help us a lot," Biss said. "Money is a big issue for us. Coming up with that nut every month is a big deal."
Famous New Yorkers helping tiny arts centers in Maine may be a new trend. In October, Maine-bred actor John Cariani recruited his castmates from the musical "The Band's Visit," including Tony Shalhoub, to do a benefit concert in New York for the Wintergreen Arts Center in Presque Isle. Cariani grew up in Presque Isle.
Wilhelm arrived in Eastport just as the Eastport Arts Center was preparing to move from downtown into the newly acquired former Baptist Church on Washington Street. She was instrumental in the purchase of the church, which was built in the 1830s, and designed the theater for the second floor. She remains active in Eastport's community theater, Stage East, though her directing days are likely over.
"Oh, I'm too ancient now," she said, shrugging off the notion of directing again. "I can't believe I am still kicking around, at this age. But I would give my eyeteeth."
Wilhelm has worked in theater most of her life, including for several years in Australia. She taught theater at Gaucher College and also worked at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. She got involved with Stage East as soon as she arrived in Eastport. Theater, she said, brings a community together. "It's extraordinary as a community builder, among other things. There are a lot of people around who have always had some sort of hankering to get on stage, not professionally but because putting on plays is such an interesting thing to do, and it's a chance to make great friends," she said.
De Blasio couldn't be reached to talk about Eastport, but last year he told News Center Maine (WCSH/WLBZ) that he liked Eastport because it was "down home. Eastport is a nice, mellow place, unspoiled. I love it."
In a statement released by the Eastport Arts Center, he said, "Where I go in the country people yearn to restore a sense of community. I find that the Eastport Arts Center achieves that goal in exemplary fashion."
Wilhelm is the sister of de Blasio's late father, Warren Wilhelm. When de Blasio was 18, his father killed himself. When de Blasio graduated from high school, he began using his mother's maiden name and legally changed his name in 2001 after a winning a seat on the New York City Council, according to The New York Times.
He was raised in Massachusetts and remains a committed Red Sox fan.

Texto completo: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking with unusual candor, said Sunday that the United States had tried but failed to end a Saudi Arabia-led blockade of Qatar, a crucial military partner in the Middle East.
He also said Saudi leaders needed to ensure that they would take full responsibility for the death last fall of Jamal Khashoggi, an outspoken dissident who lived in Virginia and who was killed on a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
Mr. Pompeo made his remarks in Doha, Qatar, just before flying to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, where he is scheduled to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's most powerful figure, on Monday.
Taken together, the comments underscored the challenges faced by the Trump administration as it tries to maintain its relationship with Saudi Arabia and build a coalition against Iran, while mitigating the fallout from a range of actions undertaken by the kingdom and Prince Mohammed, its de facto day-to-day ruler.
The State Department said in a statement on Sunday that American and Qatari officials had discussed the "Gulf crisis" arising from the blockade of Qatar, where the United States military has an important base.
The diplomatic split between Qatar and other Arab nations, which began in 2017, has been a problem for the Trump administration, especially as it seeks to forge a coalition of Arab nations to counter Iran.
The Arab nations blockading Qatar say the tiny nation is financing terrorists, interfering in their domestic affairs and growing too close with Iran, all charges that Qatari leaders deny.
Officials of Qatar, and the opposing nations, say the blockade could go on for years, and American officials now appear to be veering toward that bleak conclusion.
"It's on everyone's mind and not at all clear that the rift is any closer to being resolved today than it was yesterday," Mr. Pompeo said in a talk with State Department employees at the United States Embassy in Doha, the Qatari capital. "And I regret that."
Mr. Pompeo said he planned to raise the issue of the blockade with Prince Mohammed in their meeting on Monday, which had originally been scheduled for Sunday night, right after Mr. Pompeo's arrival in Riyadh.
Instead, Mr. Pompeo was pulled abruptly at the airport into a meeting with Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir, a senior official who stepped down last month as foreign minister, and Prince Khaled bin Salman, the crown prince's younger brother.
A State Department spokesman, Robert Palladino, said late Sunday that among the issues Mr. Pompeo had discussed with the two Saudis were the need to counter Iran and to end the Yemen war, where a Saudi-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against the Houthis, a rebel force. The airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians, and the war has resulted in the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with many Yemenis starving.
At a news conference earlier in Doha on Sunday, Mr. Pompeo said he would discuss the Khashoggi murder with Prince Mohammed to "make sure we have all the facts so that they are held accountable, certainly by the Saudis but by the United States as well where appropriate."
Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by a Saudi hit team while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, Turkish officials have said. The C.I.A. determined that Prince Mohammed had ordered the killing.
But President Trump has not endorsed that finding, and has said the United States will continue its relationship with Saudi Arabia and with the prince, who is close to Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and main Middle East adviser.
Mr. Pompeo has supported the president's viewpoint but has also spoken on occasion of the need for accountability by the Saudis. Middle East experts working in the State Department have concluded that the Saudis have not yet met the threshold of accountability.
A Saudi court has begun trial proceedings for 11 suspects in the Khashoggi killing, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for five of them.
The Saudi government has also removed a few senior officials from their posts, including Saud al-Qahtani, a close associate of the prince who was the kingdom's social media czar.
The prince has played a leading role in Saudi Arabia's policy with regard to both the Qatar blockade and the Yemen war.
As a result of the intractable situation over Qatar, Anthony Zinni, a retired Marine general and former head of American forces in the Middle East, resigned last week from his post as a Trump administration envoy charged with resolving the blockade.
"We were going nowhere on the Qatar issue," Mr. Zinni wrote last week in an email to The New York Times. CBS News first reported his resignation.
The rift among key Gulf partners has frustrated Pentagon officials. A senior defense official said that each time the Americans brought it up, Saudi and Emirati officials would dig in more.
The United States has told other Gulf nations that it will participate in a wide range of military training exercises only if Qatar is included. In all but one exercise, the hostile governments have allowed the Qatari military to participate.
At a news conference with Mr. Pompeo in Doha, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, Qatar's foreign minister, called his country's relationship with the United States "a strong partnership based on very strong premises."
Qatar shows no signs of giving up on its commitment to the Pentagon, and the American military continues to operate its air base at Al Udeid, which houses about 10,000 military personnel.
But Pentagon and intelligence officials say they fear that the split among the Arab nations will push Qatar closer to Iran.
"There's no way forward, and we're kind of stuck in it for now," said Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. "I think something seriously has got to change to make either or both sides reconsider."
There are other pressures on the relationship between the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia. The Republican-led Senate voted last month to end American military assistance to the Saudi-led coalition in the Yemen war. And the flight to Canada of Rahaf Alqunun, an 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled from the kingdom and her family this month, has again put a spotlight on human rights in the conservative nation.
But Mr. Ibish said he did not foresee the United States breaking the relationship over any of those issues.
"There's one country in the Gulf region that is large, powerful and shares most of our long-term goals about stability and security, and that's Saudi Arabia," he said. "So the list of options is very short. It's zero for both countries."

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Gun deaths soar to record 'American carnage'

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Two of the five worst mass shootings in recent U.S. history occurred in 2017, including in Las Vegas where a gunman barricaded in a high-rise hotel slaughtered 58 people at a music concert below. Mass killings kept happening last year: at a high school in Parkland, Florida; another school in Santa Fe, Texas; a synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Then, of course, there was the daily toll of less-publicized shootings and self-inflicted fatalities.
Even with Democrats taking power in the House, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream, particularly given the power of the national gun lobby and continued Republican control of the Senate and White House.
The good news is that after the Parkland shooting, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns and a license to buy handguns. The restrictions go further than federal background checks. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat.
It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3.4 per 100,000.
Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchasing guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards buying firearms and ammo, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt "red flag" laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person's firearm for a limited period of time until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Despite the disconnect between the majority of Americans who want sensible gun control and a Congress that does nothing about it, headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks. American carnage doesn't have to be a tragedy without end.

Texto completo: Bright and early Jan. 1, there was a new reality to face.
Marie Kondo was in your living room.
For the past four years or so, Kondo, a professional organizer from Japan, has been on the march. She penned two publishing juggernaut books that occupied slots 1 and 2 on The New York Times best-seller list, simultaneously. She was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People. An odd list of almost-relevant celebrities professed their love for her. She arrived at cultural phenom status by telling people how to clean up.
Now, Netflix has delivered Kondo and her KonMari method to our digital doorsteps, dropping an eight-episode season of "Tidying Up With Marie Kondo" on Jan. 1.
It's a U.S. version of her reality show, which follows along as she visits messy, cluttered houses and makes them neat again, all while maintaining a perfect, omnipresent smile and her preternaturally crisp, trademark bangs.
She definitely timed it right -- January is when many of us think about how we manage our stuff, having accumulated more of it during the preceding holiday season. Clutter is also a legitimate source of stress, and the stress epidemic is currently rolling along at breakneck pace. Any potential relief -- like a supernaturally calm neatness guru -- is almost irresistible.
Princeton scientists have shown that cluttered environments have an impact on the brain's ability to focus, and affect working memory. At UCLA, research on family life showed that the stress hormones of mothers spiked whenever they had to deal with the family's possessions. Yale researchers documented a spike in brain activity that points to genuine psychological pain when people are asked to part with possessions -- in hoarders, it's akin to the pain of drug withdrawal.
Yet Kondo falls short in addressing the psychological implications of clutter, even though there is definitely cause to examine some of the behavior demonstrated on her show. The borderline-unlikable couple in the first episode spar in an uncomfortable way, while the ever-smiling Kondo urges them to talk to their clothes. How about talking to a therapist? Cleaning up, while it has great psychological benefits, is unlikely to solve underlying issues -- the unexamined mound of trashy possessions is hardly worth throwing out since the angst is still piling up.
Kondo's almost android-like persona doesn't allow for confrontation: She's set to perma-soothe. Her best effort at getting people to understand their problem with clutter is to force them to pile all of their clothes, for instance, in one place, look at it, then start sorting. She doesn't judge, but stands back and waits for a revelation to hit.
Not making us feel bad about our messes is a huge part of her appeal and hits at the basic truth that no one can learn our lessons for us. What doesn't seem necessary is the pseudo-ritual she's concocted to go along with cleaning, which involves holding each item to see if it brings you a zing! of joy (Kondo is at her most animated when describing this zing), then thanking each holey sock and sprung-elastic bathing suit before consigning them to rapidly filling garbage bags.
I'm all for gratitude, and I get the notion of revisiting the memory of the great concert you went to as you are bidding fond farewell to the ragged concert T-shirt. Applying that to every item you own seems like a little bit of magical thinking that is bound to ring false when you're looking at your 25th pair of pilled, black underwear. And it's likely to make your cleanup take seven times longer than it needs to.
Kondo's theories also hit a snag when it comes to her main sorting criteria. "Does this item spark joy?" is an OK question to ask, but there's also "does this item replicate the 2,000 other Christmas nutcrackers in our rumpus room?" and "does this item represent the tipping point into insanity?"
Kondo nods at the idea that we'd all be better off with less stuff, but she's most intent on building in a way to let ourselves off the hook when we hang on to too much -- leaving us to wonder whether some of her subjects are headed for a serious relapse into clutter. (I'd bet on it.)
Bottom line: Mindlessly surrounding ourselves with more stuff is bad. But you don't need Kondo to break the habit and get your place cleaned up. If you want to watch her tiptoe around messy houses as a way to ease into a cleanup of your own, I won't deny you. Episode 3 features an adorable family relocating from Michigan to California, and delivers enough of Kondo's system to give you the idea.
- - -
To get started, here's all you really need to know
Break down the task. Kondo's real magic is in creating a basic order to do things in. Pick one category of stuff at a time, look at what you have, and start sorting.
"Do I use this item, and/or do I love it?" are still the best criteria for choosing what to keep and what to get rid of. You can skip thanking your old socks if you want to.
You don't need to feel guilty about accumulating things, or getting rid of them. Let all that, and the stuff, go. It's healthy on every front. If you notice some other issues cropping up as you clean, consider tackling those with a therapist.
Organizing is not hard. Group things by categories, and make sure the most-used items are stored in the most-accessible places, close to where you use them. Give everything a home it can always be returned to.
Any Gap employee can fold a T-shirt. Kondo's "origami-like" folding has been much discussed, but any folding style that works for you is good. Just choose a method, and stick to it.
Maintaining a house is everyone's job. Make your family the owners of the organizational system, not just the beneficiaries -- participation and understanding are key.

Bigoted King out; of step with U.S. ideals

Texto completo: As a percentage of its population, Iowa sent more troops to fight in the Civil War than any other state. Iowans fought on the side of the Union against the Confederate South. Abraham Lincoln, president of the United States and the commander in chief of Union forces, was the first Republican president.
So it seems odd (to me, at least) that a Republican congressman from Iowa would display a Confederate flag on his desk. But that's what Rep. Steve King did as recently as 2016. (He removed it only after it was revealed that a cop killer had waved a Confederate flag at an Iowa high school football game.)
I'm not one of those people who thinks everyone who displays a Confederate flag is necessarily a racist or a bigot. But I usually reserve the benefit of the doubt for actual Southerners who are nodding to tradition or nostalgia.
If there's one thing King has not earned it's the benefit of the doubt. Even accounting for an IQ that seems to be in conflict with the idea that white people are superior, the man understands what he's up to.
In an interview with The New York Times published Thursday, King asked: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive? Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?" The obvious answer is because he needed an education - and still does.
At the 2016 Republican National Convention, King responded to the suggestion that the GOP needs to appeal to Americans other than old white people: "I'd ask you to go back through history and figure out, where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you're talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?"
Contrary to the prattle of white nationalists and supremacists (and, interestingly, various left-wing theorists and black nationalists), Western civilization is not synonymous with whiteness. Many of the people King would count as white today were not considered white by various giants of American white nationalism and white supremacy. Czechs, Hungarians, Poles, Italians, Greeks et al. weren't "whites" at the beginning of the 20th century, when the Steve Kings of that era were terrified of non-white immigrants.
In 1911, the joint congressional Immigration Commission completed a 41-volume report that included the Dictionary of Races or Peoples, a pseudoscientific grab bag containing "a motley compendium of ethnic stereotypes, skin complexion, head shape, and other hardy perennials of the race science literature," according to Princeton historian Thomas Leonard in his vital book "Illiberal Reformers."
In fairness, "white" wasn't a term of art back then, so white supremacists were actually Aryan or Nordic or English (not Irish!) supremacists. But you get the point.
Then there's the notion that non-whites haven't made worthy contributions to civilization. Leave aside that by not counting Italians (sorry, Galileo and Da Vinci!), East Europeans (sucks for you, Copernicus!) or Jews (Einstein? Good riddance) as white, you're bequeathing many of the glories of civilization to non-whites. But even with the most expansive definition of "white" possible, how do we account for the fact that Chinese, Ottoman and Arab societies were leaps and bounds ahead of Europe for centuries? The Chinese invented the compass, paper, movable type, mechanical clocks, iron smelting and countless other innovations when "white" Europe was a barbaric backwater.
And let's not forget that Christianity is a cultural import from that great melting pot that was the Middle East.
One is reminded of Benjamin Disraeli's famous retort to an Irish Catholic parliamentarian's anti-Semitic attack on his heritage: "Yes, I am a Jew, and when the ancestors of the right honorable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island, mine were priests in the temple of Solomon."
But this is the wrong way to respond to King's bigotry. Among the best ideas and ideals of Western, Christian and, most importantly, American civilization is that we are supposed to judge people on their individual merits, not keep score based on their ancestry.
This vision was central to the creation of the Republican Party, which is why it's so dismaying that Rep. King calls himself one.

SUPERMOM'S JOURNEY!; Serena takes us along for the ride as she conquers tennis and motherhood

Resumen: From her own accounts, Williams posts video of intimate family moments, and allows fans to see the dynamic of her marriage with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. In full view, she has brought her fans along for the good days and bad as she started training again, stopped nursing sooner than she'd hoped in order to drop weight, won her first WTA matches in March and until the dramatic U.S. Open final loss to Naomi Osaka. Even in that moment, on the blue Flushing courts against a player who was clearly better on the day, Williams let us see everything that was happening; the unwinding of her composure after a chair umpire's strict interpretation of the rules, the emotion as a record 24 Grand Slam victories remained just out of grasp, rising to make Osaka's first Grand Slam title the centerpiece it deserved.

Texto completo: I f you follow Serena Williams on social media, you've probably heard of Qai Qai. Her year-old daughter Olympia's doll has her own Twitter and Instagram accounts, and even hosted a QQQ&A from Down Under, where the Australian Open is set to begin on Monday.
It's fun for Williams' fans to see Qai Qai in a director's chair courtside for practice or being hugged by Olympia, but it's also a calculated strategy of engagement. From her own accounts, Williams posts video of intimate family moments, and allows fans to see the dynamic of her marriage with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. The lighthearted part of it is just the tip of the iceberg for a woman with some very serious things to accomplish.
The annual Grand Slam campaign is about to begin and, for the millionth time in living memory, Williams has a realistic shot at all four when the Australian Open begins on Monday.
How she is doing it is nothing short of revolutionary. Last year, Williams missed the Australian but reached the final at the U.S. Open and Wimbledon, and the fourth round at the French. Through all of it, she has made motherhood a core part of the process.
"Some people believe that women go quietly and have their babies and the story is on the back end when they come back and they win and they win at the highest level," former WNBA and UConn star Swin Cash said. "She's taking the people who may only want to cover the comeback and forces them to cover the journey."
Cash, who had a little boy at about the same time Williams had Olympia, has related to Williams at every step in this story. In the way Williams presents it, having a baby isn't the obstacle in a comeback story; it's just part of the journey. Last week when Olympia wanted to be held while Williams was getting ready for a match, Williams posted photos of her getting her stretching done with Olympia in her arms.
Williams wasn't always so accessible. There were points in her career where she avoided the media, or sat for post-match press conferences like she'd been issued detention after a loss. In the last few years, that has changed. Even after difficult losses in the final at the U.S. Open and Wimbledon last year, she was available and engaged. Her opening remarks at Wimbledon were some of the most candid I'd ever heard.
In London, she discussed in emotional detail the decision to stop nursing as part of her training process.
"Once I got to six months, I felt good about it," Williams said. "Then it was just emotionally letting go. That was a different thing. I literally sat Olympia in my arms, I talked to her, we prayed about it. I told her, 'Look, I'm going to stop. Mommy has to do this.' I cried a little bit, not as much as I thought I was. She was fine. She was totally fine. It was the strangest thing. I just learned from that experience, every physical body is different."
It wasn't your usual pre-tournament press conference and it was incredibly relatable for many of the women who have followed her career and try to navigate between obligations.
"Serena being a woman and a woman of color, all the crap that she's been through and still 'I'm persevering, I'm keeping it moving,' that's amazing," Cash said. "Having to think of career and all of that, granted I think she has resources that a lot of people don't, but the intimacy of what she shares and what she is responsible for, even how she trains to come back, it's so vital and important for the times that we're in right now."
Sheryl Swoopes, Kim Clijsters, Kara Goucher, Christie Rampone, Kerri Walsh Jennings and many others have been champions with children. Few, however, have the platform that Williams does, or are doing it in an era when athletes can control such a large part of their media presence.
I'd wager, though, that Williams would still be on the Forbes list of richest athletes even if she didn't publicly embrace her role as a new mom. Perhaps even more so, and here's why.
As much as we love to beatify motherhood in western culture, we don't actually treat mothers very well. We don't give them much time off work after having a baby, or create affordable childcare solutions. Many parents can't take off time to care for a sick child without guilt, and all the costs that go with raising an educated, healthy kid are going up.
Even in media, mothering itself is considered soft news. This was brilliantly explained in a recent New York Times opinion piece from Hillary Frank, who has a parenting podcast called The Longest Shortest Time. When pitching ideas on topics related to motherhood to NPR, she'd get responses like "This is just too ... small." Meanwhile, repeated stories on erectile dysfunction were A-OK.
Frank called it a special kind of misogyny reserved for mothers.
But more than that, when it comes to women in the workforce, there is little about becoming a mother that creates the sense that you'll be better at your job. The mommy-track is still a thing, and this assumption goes double for women who are athletes.
Your body changes, and when your body is your instrument of employment, there is a chance it will not be as efficient afterwards.
And into this arena comes Serena Williams, whose excellence is incontrovertible. Who is wearing her motherhood like a badge of honor. Whose blood clots after a harrowing birth nearly made her another example of how black women are more likely to die in the process. Who faced repeated setbacks as she started her professional comeback, including withdrawing from the fourth round of the French Open against Maria Sharapova due to a pectoral injury.
Branding is one thing, but Williams' family is modeling what could be a future for working parents. Ohanian has actively called for paid parental leave, and took time after the birth of their daughter to be home. He's made time to support her in person at many events in conjunction with his own work, and has made parenting as much a part of his public face as she has.
And all of it would be lovely even if Williams had retired two years ago. But she emphatically did not. In full view, she has brought her fans along for the good days and bad as she started training again, stopped nursing sooner than she'd hoped in order to drop weight, won her first WTA matches in March and until the dramatic U.S. Open final loss to Naomi Osaka.
Even in that moment, on the blue Flushing courts against a player who was clearly better on the day, Williams let us see everything that was happening; the unwinding of her composure after a chair umpire's strict interpretation of the rules, the emotion as a record 24 Grand Slam victories remained just out of grasp, rising to make Osaka's first Grand Slam title the centerpiece it deserved.
And here she stands, strengths, scars, heart, challenges and mistakes all exposed to the air. Ready to do it again.
Yes we are entertained, but we are also enlightened. Williams' excellence is unbounded by her sport, and still she plays on.
Advantage, Williams.

The late Post columnist who saw the good in America - and justified the bad

Texto completo: On April 26, 2013, to mark the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Library in Dallas, Charles Krauthammer devoted his Washington Post opinion column to predicting how history would render judgment on Bush. Like so many of the columns Krauthammer delivered over his more than three decades as a Post columnist, it's a fairly masterful work of rhetoric. In fewer than 800 words, Krauthammer manages to defensibly compare Bush to Abraham Lincoln, exclude from view the financial crisis of 2008 (among other complexities of the Bush administration) and subtly assign blame to Barack Obama for the Boston Marathon bombing.
The climax of the piece, when it comes, has force. "Like Bush," writes Krauthammer, "Harry Truman left office widely scorned, largely because of the inconclusive war he left behind. In time, however, Korea came to be seen as but one battle in a much larger Cold War that Truman was instrumental in winning. He established the institutional and policy infrastructure (CIA, NATO, the Truman Doctrine, etc.) that made possible ultimate victory almost a half-century later. I suspect history will similarly see Bush as the man who, by trial and error but also with prescience and principle, established the structures that will take us through another long twilight struggle and enable us to prevail."
One can be fairly stunned by the judgment and still grant Krauthammer, who died last year from intestinal cancer, his due as a columnist. If there is a case to be made for the greatness of Bush, who left office seeming like one of the most disastrous American presidents of the 20th century, it is surely here. Bush was the president on watch when American power and supremacy were confronted with a world historical challenge. He made grievous mistakes. He didn't win the wars he started. But the security foundation he laid, on a bedrock of hard choices, will maintain American global dominance over the long run and thus enable the continued flourishing of the liberal democracies (including our own) that depend on such dominance.
It's a cold argument, and "The Point of It All," the posthumous anthology in which it's collected, has some ice in its veins. The acceptance of human suffering that enables Krauthammer to hypothesize Iraq as a retrospective victory for liberal democracy is rather ruthlessly deployed throughout the collection on behalf of a range of subjects. Krauthammer is hard-faced, in particular, in defense of America, "mankind's first-ever universal nation."
History, for Krauthammer, is a never-ending, unforgiving lesson in the extraordinary difficulty of carving out even small pockets of freedom, prosperity and stability. War, death, stupidity, cruelty and domineering are tolerable, in the long run, if they serve or at least don't impede the creation and sustenance of such pockets. For a free society as vast and enduring as the United States, a great deal is tolerable. The alternative isn't something better or purer, but chaos and the misery that it breeds.
This perspective achieves a kind of sublime brutality in "Thomas Jefferson, the Sublime Oxymoron," a Time magazine essay occasioned by a Library of Congress exhibition on Jefferson. Krauthammer writes admiringly, in particular, of the clarity with which Jefferson dealt with the Native American "conundrum." "Jefferson had great respect for the Indians," he writes. "He considered them the equal of the white man. And yet he fully understood that America would have to be built at their expense. . . . 'Behind every great fortune there is a crime,' said Balzac. Behind every great nation too. Jefferson certainly wanted to do justice to the Indians. But he knew the white man needed to instill fear in the Indian or the American experiment would fail."
This exculpatory turn is a characteristic Krauthammer maneuver, a harsh 100-proof tonic for a world that threatens to deprive us of consolation and certainty at every turn: It was bad, but we are nonetheless good. In some ways we are only able to be good because tough leaders are willing to be bad. Acknowledge this fact, and the past, but don't be dragged down by guilt.
Krauthammer was also quite warm, even reverential, when he wanted to be. In columns in the new collection he is charming on fatherhood, baseball, chess, the "Genius of the Founders," the miracle of modern Israel, space exploration, Australia, friendship, Tiger Woods, America and Americans, and much else. His warmth offers reassurance as well. "There is something about the American spirit - about the bedrock decency and common sense of the American - that seems to help us find our way," he writes, "something about American history that redeems itself in a way that inspires all. I would summarize it by quoting my favorite pundit, Otto von Bismarck . . . [who] is famously said to have said: 'God looks after children, drunkards, idiots and the United States of America.' I think he still does. I hope he still does."
I find this somewhat reassuring. But mostly I find Krauthammer frustrating, a smart man and expert craftsman who lacked the intellectual grit to push at, or through, his own defenses and premises. He was forgiving of the flaws of ideological allies but too often dismissive of the intellects and motives of the people with whom he disagreed. He was a close and thoughtful reader within a narrow field but indifferent to the point of ignorance when it came to many of the major intellectual figures and movements of the modern era. He practiced as a psychiatrist for seven years before becoming a full-time writer, but he wasn't interested in the nuances of human psychology. He was a facile writer of sentences, an excellent summarizer of ideas and a master architect of the op-ed, which is a notoriously difficult form.
But he was a complacent thinker. Krauthammer stopped at the point when things threatened to become too complex or messy. Even his contempt for Donald Trump, which he was admirably willing to bear with him into the lion's den (i.e. Fox News), ran up against hard limits. Trump, for Krauthammer, wasn't symptomatic of deeper flaws in our country or the conservative movement. He was an aberration.
"Beware the too-examined life," he said to the McGill University class of 1993, in a commencement speech included in "The Point of It All." This was not a throwaway line for Krauthammer. It was core to his worldview. Introspection, self-consciousness, deconstruction: For Krauthammer these practices were more likely to be vices than virtues, corrosive to the good life, sound political judgment and global leadership.
I think he introspected too little and forgave too much. But it's worth admitting (as he would not, if he were in my position) that I might be wrong. We all choose the level of complexity at which it makes sense for us to live. We simplify, because it is impossible to do otherwise. We live more meaningfully in the conviction that certain broad notions, like love and truth, are richer than the subsidiary levels of discourse into which they can be parsed. We recognize that dwelling at length on one's faults, failures and traumas can sabotage the capacity to function and grow. We believe that the particular constellation of principles, reductions, generalizations, elisions, emphases and self-deceptions that constitutes our political worldview is the precise one that, if adopted by everyone, would be most conducive to the health of the republic. We all have our stories.
Krauthammer had his stories. They spoke - speak - to many, many people. As I write these words, "The Point of It All" is second on the Washington Post and New York Times nonfiction bestseller lists, in both cases just behind Michelle Obama's "Becoming." This is an instructive, or ironic, pairing. Krauthammer had almost nothing but disdain for Obama's husband and for the more introspective, tempered patriotism of the first couple. He thought it subverted the national project and was a luxury that leaders couldn't afford.
I'm on Team Obama, but it's worth saying that if the big argument we were having right now, as a nation, were reflected in a battle for bestseller supremacy between a serious, careful conservative like Charles Krauthammer and a thoughtful liberal like Michelle Obama, we'd be in a much better place. I fear that it's No. 4 on the Post list, the Colbert show's cheap, Trump-mocking picture book "Whose Boat Is This Boat?," that is the more accurate signpost.

Texto completo: Owners of Amazon's Ring home-security systems can see inside and outside their homes remotely but so can a bunch of tech workers in a location that's a hotbed of cybercrime, new reports suggest.
E-commerce giant Amazon bought Ring for $853 million last year, and the New York Times' popular Wirecutter website soon deemed Ring's video-equipped doorbell a worthy addition to home security.
But in addition to the doorbells, and a variety of outdoor cameras and sensors, Ring also sells indoor cameras that integrate with its home-security system, and Wirecutter has now added a warning to its review: "A recent story in The Intercept alleges that Ring may have allowed its employees inappropriate and potentially unrestricted access to its customers' video streams or recordings."
The Intercept, a tech-focused news site, reported that despite Ring's mission to keep homes and their occupants secure, "the company's treatment of customer video feeds has been anything but."
The company gave its Ukraine-based R&D team "virtually unfettered access" to "every video created by every Ring camera around the world," according to The Intercept.
"The Ukraine team was also provided with a corresponding database that linked each specific video file to corresponding specific Ring customers," the site reported.
Citing unnamed sources, The Intercept reported that the Ukraine team was allowed to watch the video feeds so they could improve the company's image-recognition software by identifying objects in imagery by tagging them.
"A second source, with direct knowledge of Ring's video-tagging efforts, said that the video annotation team watches footage not only from the popular outdoor and doorbell camera models, but from household interiors," The Intercept reported, adding that the process appears to still be in use at the company.
"The source said that Ring employees at times showed each other videos they were annotating and described some of the things they had witnessed, including people kissing, firing guns, and stealing."
The site's reporting followed an article on investigative-journalism website The Information, which first exposed the purported practice, pointing to late 2016 as the estimated time it started, and noting the significance of the R&D team's location.
"The risk was heightened in Ukraine, a hotbed of cybercrime," according to The Information. "If the information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could give would-be thieves a virtual guide for when to break into someone's home."
Amazon had imposed stricter controls on Ring employees' viewing of video, according to The Intercept. "Employees in Ukraine are no longer allowed to download and store videos on their computers, for example," the site reported.
A Ring spokesperson on Friday acknowledged that the firm views and annotates certain Ring videos, but said Ring takes customers' personal information very seriously.
"These recordings are sourced exclusively from publicly shared Ring videos from the Neighbors app (in accordance with our terms of service), and from a small fraction of Ring users who have provided their explicit written consent to allow us to access and utilize their videos for such purposes," the spokesperson said.
"Ring employees do not have access to livestreams from Ring products."
The company added that it holds employees to a high ethical standard, and said, "anyone in violation of our policies faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties. In addition, we have zero tolerance for abuse of our systems and if we find bad actors who have engaged in this behavior, we will take swift action against them."
According to The Intercept, Ring describes "Neighbors" a neighborhood-watch system that allows users to share information and imagery from their Ring cameras without mentioning image recognition, and without warning that "those who use the feature are opting in to have their homes watched by individuals in a Ukrainian R&D lab."
The company only addresses image recognition deep in its privacy policy, saying, "you may choose to use additional functionality in your Ring product that, through video data from your device, can recognize facial characteristics of familiar visitors," the site reported.

LAUSD teachers went on strike in 1989. But are the stakes higher in 2019?

Texto completo: Whether they were stuck in an auditorium or playing long-term hooky, many a school kid old enough to remember the 1989 Los Angeles teachers strike recalls the period as nine days of good old-fashioned lawlessness.
Quoted in a New York Times article at the time, LAPD Lieut. Frank Valdez expressed his concern about “little predators” roaming LA’s downtown streets. “The problem kids are not going to go to school and it’s going to create problems all over, not just on campus,” he said during the strike.
Jamie Todd Rubin, an 11th-grader at Cleveland High School at the time, wistfully remembers weekday ventures to the beach, Valley bowling alleys and movie theatres while his teachers fought for better pay as his personal “golden age.”
Triumphantly, he recalled that “teachers ended up getting what they were looking for too.” In many respects, they did.
By all accounts, teachers succeeded in gleaning higher wages, more administrative control and greater stature for their union from the Los Angeles Unified School District after thousands walked off the job in the spring of 1989.
It was the second teachers strike since the founding of United Teachers Los Angeles in 1970, ushering angst into the city and turmoil to the nation’s second largest school system.
In 1989, the major win for teachers after the walkout that lasted nine days was getting school-based management and shared decision-making into a contract. Around 80 percent of members participated in the strike, and half of LAUSD K-12 students stayed home.
Read full LA Unified School District coverage here
As an army of 30,000 teachers stand ready to form new picket lines on Monday, their demands ring markedly familiar: higher pay, relief from ballooning class sizes, and more nurses, librarians and counselors trained to address the medical and psychological needs of today’s students.
Has much really changed?
Former UTLA President John Perez, who was on the picket lines both as a teacher in 1970, said it this way:
“To be perfectly honest, very little has changed. In 1970 we felt disrespected. In 1989 we felt disrespected. And in 2018 teachers feel disrespected.”
Undercurrents of teacher empowerment were also at the crux of the 1970 strike, UTLA’s first, when around half of the young union’s members went off the job for nearly five weeks.
Then, as now, district officials threatened that acceding to their calls for salary increases would spell financial ruin.
Parallels between ’89 and today run as deep as rhetorical strategy, like the union’s relentless critiques of LA Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner.
“Oh yeah it was a big war in ’89 and the union made superintendent [Leonard] Britton the bad guy,” Perez said. Picketing teachers wore buttons with his face over a lemon, or with a slash over his face. “We called him Lenny the lemon.”
Some have argued all this recurrence is evidence that the lasting effects of earlier strikes have been mixed at best, and that securing lasting public funding for education has proven elusive over the decades.
Former LAUSD elementary school teacher Michael Romo lamented the lack of progress since 1989.
“Back in my day we had nurses, smaller class sizes and maybe even better stocked libraries,” said Romo, director of the California Teachers Association in Burbank and Glendale.
He went on strike in 1989, his first year of bilingual teaching at Norwood Street Elementary School. “For 30 years to come back to the same issue, it’s like we’ve made no progress.”
Of course, things do change in 30 years. Along with overarching economic differences and a friendlier face in the governor’s mansion, a key factor in this looming walkout that appears to have been absent from previous strikes is competing visions for the future of public education.
UCLA Professor John Rogers, director of the university’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, interpreted the current impasse between the district and the union as a reflection of opposite reactions LAUSD’s current financial and enrollment woes.
“The district is thinking about how they can contain costs and deal with a growing charter school sector by devolving the district over time as a portfolio of schools,” he said. “While teachers think the way forward is to more broadly improve the quality of its own educational program, only sometimes acknowledging how much spending that requires.”
The emergence of charter schools in Los Angeles, which are privately managed but publicly funded, have been central to the standoff between district and union leadership.
Perez seems to think this is uncharted territory, particularly what he said was superintendent Beutner’s goals to break up and “privatize” the a time-honored and democratic institution like L.A. Unified.
“The existential threat to public education as we know it is real. That wasn’t there in 1989,” he said. The district’s financial woes this time around also have some experts worried about a state takeover.
“My understanding is after the strike it will appear to be a win for teachers and then the layoffs will come soon after,” said UCLA Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies Pedro Noguera.
Noting LA County’s recent appointment of a fiscal team to the district, he said “That’s my fear, that they’re at risk of being taken over.”
Carmen Romero, special education teacher at South Gate High School, remembers those long days in auditoriums, in the gym and on the football field as a 10th-grader at Bell High School during the 1989 strike.
“We didn’t feel valued as students,” she said about the nine days of boredom. More of a rule-follower, she was on campus every day of the strike.
“But it made me appreciate school more, and feel like I deserve things like desks and respect.” Now that she’s gearing up to get on the picket line as a teacher, “It’s the same feeling.”

A man usually tells you to walk, not a woman, because of frequency not sexism

Texto completo: Q. Where I live they have been changing the crosswalk buttons to these fancy new ones that beep, flash and talk to you. Why are all of the voices men’s voices? Isn’t this the age of equality?
– Patrick Shane, North Tustin
A. Patrick lives in unincorporated county territory, near the city of Tustin. After getting some specifics on the traffic signals, he and Honk agreed the city would be best to ask, as at least some of these new-school devices are in Tustin.
Krys Saldivar , the manager of the Tustin’s Public Works Department, said the city is upgrading all of its pedestrian push buttons tied to traffic signals, with about 40 percent having these newer devices.
“Those who are blind will be able to hear where they are crossing and when to cross, and those who are deaf will feel the vibration when it is safe to cross,” she told Honk in an email. “The first ones that have been installed in the city were actually programmed by the manufacturer.”
That would be Polara, a Texas-based company.
Its president, John McGaffey , said if a city asks, Polara can provide a female voice; it has done so before. But it generally uses a male voice.
“In controlled studies using … accessible pedestrian signals, the majority of the visually impaired participants said they were able to hear a male voice better because it has greater low-range frequencies (under 800 Hz), which people can tend to hear, even with some hearing loss. We also try to keep the voice consistent so the messages sound similar, no matter where you are in the United States.”
Q. My license expires on my birthday in June. Should I go ahead and make an appointment with the Department of Motor Vehicles now because of the crowded DMV offices, with the popularity of the REAL ID? Or should I wait until they send me a notice? It’s very confusing! Thank you!
– Linda Wells, Mission Viejo
A. DMV officials and Honk readers have told the wise one, that would be Honk, that wait times have gone way down since the mess in the summer.
Still, appointments are the way to go if you must go into an office to renew your license (Typically every 15 years until you hit age 70, then every five years).
“She can make an appointment before she receives her renewal notice,” Marty Greenstein , a DMV spokesman up in Sacramento, said via email. “In fact, that’s something we encourage. If you know your license is going to expire in a few months, go ahead and make your appointment. We started sending out renewal notices 90 days in advance this summer (up from 60) to give people more time.”
The DMV takes appointments for several months out. Linda noticed that the two DMV offices near her home were completely booked. What about that?
“Appointment availability can change on a daily basis as offices perform daily assessments, or spots open when an appointment is canceled,” Greenstein said.
So keep trying, Linda.
But don’t go too early to a DMV office to renew, or you will be required to take what used to be called a “written” test and is now a “knowledge” test (it is usually done on a touchscreen these days) even if you weren’t scheduled for one. The DMV reasons that if you renew real early, then you are shortening up the time it has to monitor your track record out there on the roads, so the test is meant to ensure you are a safe motorist.
“In instances when a knowledge test is not required, coming in at any time during that 90-day window before your license expires should not trigger that requirement,” Greenstein added.
Honkin’ cool: A dad didn’t want his daughter to be alone on Christmas, so Hal Vaughan took six flights over three days to be with her. Pierce Vaughan is a rookie flight attendant for Delta Air Lines, and Dad shadowed her, able to jump on standby for free, a perk of his daughter’s job. A passenger heard about the journey, put it on Facebook and the cute story went viral. The trip: New Orleans; Detroit; Fort Myers, Fla.; Detroit; Hartford, Conn.; Atlanta; and back to New Orleans (Source: The New York Times).

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday canceled his planned trip to the annual and glittering economic conference in Davos, Switzerland, later this month, citing what he called the Democrats' intransigence on his funding request to build a wall along the United States' southern border.
Trump and congressional Democrats are at an impasse over the president's request of more than $5.7 billion to build the wall. That impasse caused a partial government shutdown, which has been going for nearly three weeks.
“Because of the Democrats intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation, I am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum," Trump wrote on Twitter. “My warmest regards and apologies to the @WEF!"
The forum, an annual gathering of the world's political and financial elite, is typically an event American presidents avoid. Trump was the first president to attend the forum, in 2018, since Bill Clinton attended in 2000.
Earlier Thursday, officials in Davos authorized a protest by a socialist youth group against Trump and other expected attendees of the Davos conference.
Authorities rejected a similar protest request last year when Trump attended the elite event, citing heavy snowfall.

President denies knowledge of Manafort data sharing
WASHINGTON — President Trump said Thursday that he knew nothing about his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, allegedly sharing 2016 presidential campaign polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate the FBI has said has ties to Russian intelligence.
That information was included in a court filing this week that appeared to inadvertently include details not intended to be made public and indicates a pathway by which the Russians could have had access to Trump campaign data.
"No I didn't know anything about it," Trump said in response to a question from a reporter as he departed the White House en route to Texas, where he is visiting the US-Mexico border. Trump did not elaborate and turned to another reporter with a question on a different topic.
Trump's response comes as Special Counsel Robert Mueller continues to probe whether there was coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.
Manafort on Tuesday denied in a filing from his defense team that he broke his plea deal by lying repeatedly to prosecutors working for Mueller about that and other issues.
In his rebuttal to the special counsel's claims of dishonesty, Manafort exposed details of the dispute, much of which centers on his relationship with Kilimnik. The Russian citizen, who began working for Manafort's consulting firm starting in 2005, has been charged with helping his former boss to obstruct Mueller's investigation of Russian interference into the 2016 election. He is believed to be in Moscow.
The special counsel alleged Manafort "lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign," according to the unredacted filing. The source of that data, including whether it came from the Trump campaign, is unclear.

Walking out said to be a trademark negotiating tactic
President Trump's decision to abruptly walk out of a meeting with congressional leaders on Wednesday shocked some on Capitol Hill.
But those who have done business with him recognized it as one of his trademark negotiating tactics.
Long before he entered the White House — where the latest turn on his heel occurred — Trump was known to have done the same thing when a deal wasn't going his way. He even walked out of a judge's chambers during divorce proceedings.
His exit on Wednesday, however, appeared to gain him little traction with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic lawmakers who attended the Situation Room meeting. She called Trump's approach to the shutdown talks “pathetic," while Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer claimed the president had thrown a “temper tantrum," slamming the table before walking out.
Trump on Thursday tweeted that Schumer “told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I 'slammed the table & walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum.' " Trump said he “politely said bye-bye and left, no slamming!"
According to Jay Goldberg, who was Trump's lawyer from 1989 to 2014 and handled two of his divorces, the president has reason to believe that walking out could be effective.
“He crafted that approach, it's one he owns," Goldberg said. “He has a tendency to argue, and if he is not satisfied he will leave the room, disappear, doesn't come back, and the people are on edge wondering where he is. And then when he feels it is the appropriate time he comes back."
Goldberg said that Trump once attended a protracted meeting to reach a divorce settlement with his first wife, Ivana Trump. After hours of talks, he disagreed with the amount of alimony she wanted, and the two sides couldn't agree. So Trump stood up and left.
“Everyone was looking for him because without his presence a deal couldn't be done and he was gone for two hours and we didn't know where he was," Goldberg said. “When he came back, the other side was so concerned if they didn't make a deal he would walk away again."
In another episode during the divorce case, Trump walked out on a judge he thought had made an unreasonable request and didn't come back, rattling the judge and lawyers from both sides, Goldberg said.

Texto completo: The investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election isn't just focused on criminal acts. Worried about the president's erratic behavior and the firing of FBI Director James Comey, the FBI opened an inquiry into President Trump directly, a new report says.

The counterintelligence investigation that examined if Trump was working for Russia, now part of the inquiry special counsel Robert Mueller took over when he was appointed, was rolled into Mueller's investigation because if Comey's firing was aimed at ending the Russia investigation, it needed to be investigated both as a possible crime and a national security concern, the New York Times reported.

While Mueller's inquiry has led to the indictment of dozens of people, including close Trump advisers such as campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his former personal attorney Michael Cohen, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mueller has yet to conclude his investigation.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called the report "absurd."

"James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI," Sanders said.

Pompeo's Cairo Speech Contained Inaccuracies

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a major speech in Cairo on Thursday, rebuked the Obama administration's policies in the Middle East and hailed the accomplishments of the Trump administration.
"It's the truth, lowercase 't,' that I'm here to talk about today," Mr. Pompeo said. "It is a truth that isn't often spoken in this part of the world, but because I'm a military man by training, I'll be very blunt and direct today: America is a force for good in the Middle East. We need to acknowledge that truth, because if we don't, we make bad choices -- now and in the future."
Yet Mr. Pompeo's speech was not always accurate. Here's a fact-check.
What Mr. Pompeo Said
"America's reluctance, our reluctance, to wield our influence kept us silent as the people of Iran rose up against the mullahs in Tehran in the Green Revolution."
This is exaggerated.
In June 2009, thousands of protesters took to Iran's streets to dispute the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and called for more political freedom, clashing with riot police officers. President Barack Obama's response was muted, but he did speak about the "Green Movement," or "Green Revolution."
"Like the rest of the world, we were impressed by the vigorous debate and enthusiasm that this election generated, particularly among young Iranians. We continue to monitor the entire situation closely, including reports of irregularities," Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama's press secretary, said in a statement on June 13, the day election results were announced and protests erupted.
At a news conference two days later, Mr. Obama said he was "deeply troubled by the violence that I've been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process -- free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are universal values and need to be respected."
Saying the United States would continue to engage in dialogue with Iran, Mr. Obama added, "I think it would be wrong for me to be silent about what we've seen on the television over the last few days." Mr. Obama continued: "To the youth of Iran, I want them to know that we in the United States do not want to make any decisions for the Iranians, but we do believe that the Iranian people and their voices should be heard and respected."
In subsequent news conferences, interviews and official statements, Mr. Obama continued to emphasize that the United States should not be seen as interfering in Iran's election but condemned the violence directed at the protesters and called for freedom of political expression.
Reasonable people can argue whether the Obama administration did or said enough to support the protests, but Mr. Obama was not "silent."
What Mr. Pompeo Said
"When the mission is over, when the job is complete, America leaves. Today in Iraq, at the government's invitation, we have approximately 5,000 troops where there were once 166,000."
This needs context.
Mr. Pompeo's numbers are accurate, but most of the troop withdrawals occurred under Mr. Obama -- whose foreign policy decisions the secretary of state had condemned moments earlier in his speech.
In October 2007, there were 166,000 troops in Iraq, the peak of the American military presence in the country. Troop levels declined every year from 2009 to 2012, under Mr. Obama, with the last combat convoy fighting in the Iraq war leaving in December 2011.
The rise of the Islamic State, however, led Mr. Obama to send troops back to Iraq, with some 4,600 American service members deployed in Iraq in July 2016. An estimated 5,000 troops remained in Iraq as of December 2018.
What Mr. Pompeo Said
"There's no contradiction whatsoever. This is a story made up by the media."
This is misleading.
Asked in a news conference about conflicting statements on President Trump's plan to quickly withdraw troops from Syria, Mr. Pompeo insisted that administration officials have been "very clear."
Yet Mr. Trump and other officials have given contradictory statements on whether the Islamic State has been defeated, and shifted the timeline for withdrawal from "now" to when the Islamic State has been defeated.
On Dec. 19, Mr. Trump announced the withdrawal and declared victory over the Islamic State on Twitter, adding, "Our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now. We won."
Defense Department officials told The New York Times that Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal to be completed within 30 days. The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post reported that the departure would be "rapid."
Four days later, Mr. Trump said the withdrawal would be "slow" and "highly coordinated" and maintained that "our troops are coming home!" On Dec. 31, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the Islamic State was not completely defeated, and repeated that troops would return home "slowly."
The Times reported that Mr. Trump extended his timetable to four months, though Mr. Trump denied that in a January cabinet meeting.
Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, told reporters on Jan. 6 that American forces would remain until the complete defeat of the Islamic State and until Turkey guaranteed the safety of Syrian Kurds. That same day, Mr. Trump echoed Mr. Bolton's statement and said that troops "won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone."

Texto completo: Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds won't back embattled Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, in his 2020 primary election.

King served as one of Reynolds' 2018 re-election campaign co-chairs, but she said Wednesday she wouldn't endorse him in 2020 after GOP state Sen. Randy Feenstra announced this week he would challenge the nine-term incumbent next cycle.

"The last election was a wake-up call for it to be that close. That indicates that it does open the door for other individuals to take a look at that," Reynolds told local television station WHO-TV, referring to King's narrow three percentage point win in November over former professional baseball player J.D. Scholten in a solid Republican congressional district.

"I will stay out of the primary. I'm not going to weigh in," Reynolds said.

Reynolds' comments come after she started distancing herself from King last year. King had faced heavy criticism ahead of his Nov. 6 re-election for statements he had made about race and immigration policy. Among his detractors were the National Republican Congressional Committee.

NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, slammed King in October after he refused to delete a retweeted post on Twitter about "Satan" George Soros, which critics perceived as anti-Semitic, especially in light of last year's fatal shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pa.

King also gave an interview in August to members of the Austria Freedom Party, an organization with links to white nationalists. He additionally supported Faith Goldy, a candidate for Toronto mayor, who appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast.

King on Thursday questioned during an interview with the New York Times how language surrounding white nationalism and white supremacy became "offensive."

“Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?” he said.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump headed to Texas on Thursday in an effort to promote his wall and again threatened to declare a national emergency if Democrats don't agree to his demand for more wall funding.
Republicans didn't meet their deadlines
By Robert Robb
The primary cause of the government shutdown is a failure of governance by Republicans in Congress.
The federal government's fiscal year begins Oct. 1. There is a law that sets interim deadlines to ensure that a budget is in place before the new fiscal year begins.
Both chambers of Congress are to agree to a budget resolution by April 15. That resolution is supposed to create an outline within which the respective Appropriations Committees are to operate.
The House is required to pass all appropriations bills to fund the government in the upcoming year by June 30. There is no deadline for action by the Senate or adoption of a final budget. But the clear intent is for all that to get done in the summer, so the new fiscal year begins with a budget approved by Congress and signed by the president.
Talker: What happens to the Mueller investigation when Rosenstein leaves?
Sign-up for Today's Talker newsletter here
Last year, Republicans were in charge of both chambers of Congress and the presidency. Yet Oct. 1 rolled around without a budget in place for roughly a quarter of the federal government.
There is no more fundamental responsibility of Congress than passing a budget for the federal government. Republicans kept claiming that they would return to "regular order" and actually pass appropriations bills in time to avoid the drama and gamesmanship of continuing resolutions under the threat of a government shutdown.
Their failure to do so deserves most of the blame for the impasse. If they had done their job, as they pledged to do, the federal government would be fully funded for the year and no one would have the leverage to shut it down.
Is there a way out of the impasse?
At this point, a border "wall" is mostly symbolic for both sides.
A physical barrier can help inhibit illegal entry. It is not a waste of money, particularly by federal government standards. And it is not immoral. But it is also far from the main event in reducing illegal immigration.
What is immoral is the treatment of federal workers in this impasse. Workers shouldn’t be denied a paycheck because politicians can’t get their most basic task, passing a budget, done on time. Nor should they be required to work without pay, even if it will be made up in arrears.
Democrats have offered a reasonable way out of the impasse: Pass appropriations for the rest of the year for all remaining federal agencies except Homeland Security. Pass a short-term continuing resolution for Homeland Security and continue the fight over funding for physical barriers on the border.
The only possible GOP objection is that such a resolution would reduce Trump's leverage to force Democrats to give on funding the "wall. "
In our system of government, the president shouldn’t have the leverage to shut down the operations of unrelated agencies to try to impose his will on a particular point. And it is irresponsible for Republicans in Congress to give him that leverage.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he won't bring to the floor any shutdown resolution that the president isn't committed to sign. That's a mistake.
For one thing, what Trump says in advance doesn't necessarily indicate what he will do in the event. McConnell previously brought a continuing resolution to the floor, which passed, on the understanding that Trump would sign it. And then Trump reneged.
The Democratic proposal is reasonable. It would probably pass the Senate. It probably wouldn't pass with enough Republican votes to overcome a presidential veto. But there is always the possibility that it might.
Having irresponsibly failed to pass a budget when in control of both chambers of Congress, Republicans shouldn't compound the irresponsibility with truculence now that they control only one.
Robert Robb is a columnist at The Arizona Republic, where this column first appeared. You can follow him on Twitter: @RJRobb
What others are saying
Frank Bruni, The New York Times: "(The wall is) a function of, more than anything, (Trump's) ego, his vanity, to which the television networks, furloughed federal workers — all Americans — are hostage. He’s not remarkable among presidents in having a high opinion of himself and in desperately wanting others to share it. A robust measure of arrogance and some degree of neediness are what make the grind of the campaign trail and the glare of the media bearable. And all presidents want to rack up triumphs that make them look and feel large. But none in my lifetime has spun so many falsehoods in the service of that. None has been so naked in his hunger for that heft. "
Jonathan Turley, The Hill: "Congress gave President Donald Trump such authority in the National Emergencies Act, augmenting claims of inherent authority, but the source of the funds could be more challenging. Under two laws in Title 10 and Title 33 of the United States Code, he could seek to use unobligated funds originally set aside for military construction projects, or divert funds from Army civil works projects. There are limitations on the use of such money, and there could be strong challenges to the use of unobligated funds in other areas. There is money there to start but not nearly enough to finish such a wall without proper appropriation. "
Noah Feldman, Bloomberg: "The Constitution does contain an emergency powers clause. Article I, Section 9 allows for the suspension of habeas corpus in cases of rebellion or invasion. From the fact that the suspension clause exists, you can deduce something very basic to the U. S. constitutional system: There are no other inherent constitutional emergency powers. . . . Those emergency powers are unsurprisingly varied and broad. But none of them can displace the Constitution itself. And it is the Constitution that says the Congress appropriates money and the executive spends it. "
What our readers are saying
Republicans controlled the White House and Congress for two years. If this is such a crisis, why didn't they appropriate money for the wall? Because there is no crisis, just a gambit to keep the gullible, ignorant base foaming at the mouth.
— Ron David
Liberal Democrats are the party of failure. Unfortunately, there is opportunity for bad actors who are exploiting our system, and we have American taxpayers paying for it.
— Robert Williamson
Our airports are less safe now. Proper food inspections are possibly being skipped. The social safety nets are at risk. Allowing President Donald Trump to destroy our federal government this way over a failed 2016 campaign promise is un-American. Stay strong, Democrats. Don't allow Trump to get away with this or he will just do it again.
— John Bertelson
Finally, a president who has the guts to tell Democrats to go pound sand when they refuse to negotiate. Pull the cord and declare a national emergency, Mr. President, and build that wall.

Resumen: Getting off the ground has been no issue for our captain. Since he took the helm, the city budget has risen over 25% to its current altitude of $90 billion, more than tripling inflation. The reality is that the mayor enjoyed a tremendous growth of the city's coffers that stemmed from the economic recovery, the city's wage growth, its booming real estate industry and steady stock-market gains. With the passage of the federal tax cut in late 2017, income mobility away from high-taxed jurisdictions may become more of a factor in sagging personal income tax revenue growth, which the Council forecasts will only be 0.1% this year.

Texto completo: When an airplane faces an emergency while climbing, it is seldom forced to make an immediate descent back into an airport. Instead, its pilot "squawks 7700" to let air traffic controllers know of the urgency, then proceeds to level off the aircraft to work through the problem and recalibrate its systems.
As New York City heads into a new budget cycle this month after years of rising expenses, our pilot, Mayor de Blasio, would be serving his passengers well if he took this opportunity to squawk 7700, level off spending and recalibrate our finances.
Getting off the ground has been no issue for our captain. Since he took the helm, the city budget has risen over 25% to its current altitude of $90 billion, more than tripling inflation. New York's additional $19 billion of spending since de Blasio took office, in itself, is substantially larger than the country's second largest municipal budget: San Francisco's paltry $11 billion.
The totality of our city budget is staggering. The Department of Sanitation alone spends more money than the government of Haiti and has more people in green than the army of Ireland. If this week's announcement of a new $100 million health plan for all uninsured New Yorkers is any indication, it may yet still grow.
The reality is that the mayor enjoyed a tremendous growth of the city's coffers that stemmed from the economic recovery, the city's wage growth, its booming real estate industry and steady stock-market gains. These revenues were the jet fuel that propelled new entitlements and services, including: UPK; 3-K; Fair Fares; and a heavily subsidized ferry system. The city also doubled its spending on homeless services, and this mayor was forced to settle contracts with 150 municipal unions, which his predecessor had simply let expire.
The skies were clear for several years as city spending hurtled ever upward; but in 2019, warning lights are flickering and alarm bells hum. The good news is that more often than not, when a plane squawks 7700, the problems are manageable and a skilled pilot can continue on in safety.
The first alarm bell rings for the real estate industry, long the backbone of the City's finances. While last year's executive proposal acknowledged a slight slowdown in the market, it still projected a steady growth of annual property tax revenue by 6.1%. Yet as soon as the ink dried on that budget, news broke that the city had seen its worst real estate sales quarter since the financial crisis began. By year's end, The New York Times called a slumping housing market "the new normal."
Another alarm warns of turbulence ahead in the stock market. The City Council's 2019 Economic and Revenue Forecast ominously warned that future Wall Street volatility would "[remove] some fuel from income tax collections."
Of lesser concern are some warning lights off to the side of the cockpit. Revenue streams that account for smaller, but significant, percentages of the budget are projected to remain flat in the coming years. These include taxes on utilities, hotels, commercial rents and cigarettes.
The final warnings are coming directly from passengers in the cabin. They are growing sick of rising ticket prices. With the passage of the federal tax cut in late 2017, income mobility away from high-taxed jurisdictions may become more of a factor in sagging personal income tax revenue growth, which the Council forecasts will only be 0.1% this year.
We still desperately need the top 1% of earners in first class to pay 44% of the city's income tax.
Taken individually, these are all manageable concerns. But as with all warning signs, a good pilot knows the importance of leveling off while the problems are corrected. Let's hope de Blasio proves his mettle.
Borelli represents Staten Island in the City Council.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge dismissed part of Ashley Judd's multipronged lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein on Wednesday, ruling that her allegations of sexual harassment do not fall within the scope of a California statute.
The order by Judge Philip S. Gutierrez of United States District Court in Los Angeles does not end Ms. Judd's case, which is built around other claims, including defamation and unfair business practices. In a suit filed in May, she claimed that her career withered because Mr. Weinstein spread lies about her in Hollywood after she rejected his sexual requests.
"Nothing about today's ruling changes that Ms. Judd's case is moving forward on multiple claims," Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., the lead lawyer representing Ms. Judd, said in a statement.
Judge Gutierrez's 13-page order on Wednesday made it clear that he was making no judgment on whether Ms. Judd had been sexually harassed by Mr. Weinstein "in the colloquial sense of the term." Rather, the ruling was limited to whether a recent change in California sexual harassment law applied to Ms. Judd, who has said in court filings that Mr. Weinstein, appearing in a bathrobe during a business meeting at his hotel in the 1990s, asked her to submit to a massage and watch him shower. Ms. Judd previously recounted the episode in an interview with The New York Times.
Mr. Weinstein has denied engaging in nonconsensual sexual activity.
"We have said from the beginning that this claim was unjustified, and we are pleased that the court saw it as we did," Phyllis Kupferstein, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement. "We believe that we will ultimately prevail on her remaining claims."
In September, Judge Gutierrez ruled that Ms. Judd could not claim sexual harassment because she did not have a specific business relationship with Mr. Weinstein at the time -- a requirement of the statute. But the court allowed Ms. Judd to amend the sexual harassment part of her complaint and resubmit it. Her lawyers did so, citing end-of-year revisions to California sexual harassment laws and arguing that the changes should be applied retroactively.
It is rare for people to recover damages for smear campaigns -- for instance, quietly labeling actresses as "difficult" when they do not acquiesce to powerful men -- because of how complicated it can be to prove the action took place, much less harmed a career. But Ms. Judd has an A-list director on her side: Peter Jackson, who came forward early last year to say he removed Ms. Judd from a "Lord of the Rings" casting list "as a direct result" of what he now thought was "false information" provided by Mr. Weinstein.
In her original suit for defamation, Ms. Judd said that, until Mr. Jackson came forward, she did not know that "something unseen was holding her back from obtaining the work she wanted, and had been doing so for decades."
Separately, Mr. Weinstein faces a criminal trial in New York City this year. He faces charges that he raped one woman and forced another to allow him to perform oral sex on her.

Texto completo: Donnie Romero — a pastor who gained national attention after his views on the Pulse nightclub shooting inspired a protest from LGBTQ advocates — has resigned. In a video posted to YouTube, Romero says that he had sinned by paying for sex, gambling and using drugs.
Romero — formerly the pastor of Stedfast Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas — publicly voiced support for the Pulse nightclub gunman, who opened fire inside the popular LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando and killed 49 people. A June 2016 Dallas Morning News report says Romero's words sparked a protest.
"These 50 sodomites are all perverts and pedophiles, they're the scum of the Earth and the Earth is a better place now and I'll take it a step further," Romero said in a sermon published online, the publication reports. "I'll pray to God like I did this morning, and I will again tonight, that God will finish the job that that man started," Romero said.

Jan. 8: School official who allegedly told trans teen 'You freak me out' could keep job
Citing videos of a church meeting and an affiliated pastor, the New York Times reports that Romero resigned his ministry last week amid allegations of adultery and drug use.
An apology video, purportedly of Romero, was posted to YouTube on Wednesday.
"I went to Jacksonville and I went to a casino and I was drinking. And there were girls there that were prostitutes and I committed adultery on my wife multiple times. I drank and gambled multiple times. . . . I even smoked weed. "
In the video, Romero repeatedly apologizes for his actions, while standing by his beliefs: "I haven't changed anything I believe. I still believe exactly the same. "
Stedfast Baptist Church was classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-LGBT hate group in 2017.

Texto completo: David Folkenflik will take your questions now.
Or, more precisely, he will Tuesday, when he opens the new season of Point Park University's Media Innovators speaker series.
Mr. Folkenflik, NPR media correspondent and co-host of "On Point," appears at the school's brand new Pittsburgh Playhouse, Downtown. He also is the author of "Murdoch's World: The Last of the Old Media Empires."
"We wanted people who were innovative in the media in some way, and who could speak to the changes that are happening in media and society today," said Andrew Conte, director of the Center for Media Innovation. "So, having David come in and speak about the media was important, a good way to kick off the project."
Mr. Folkenflik really enjoys the give-and-take of a conversation.
"I want it to feel like a live, organic back-and-forth," he said. "I thrive off of that."
So, no long lectures. Students are encouraged to engage their guest about issues - whether it's the president's latest slam on the media, Netflix pulling an episode of "Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj" on order from the Saudi government, or something else entirely.
Although Point Park launched the speaker series last year with Newsmax founder Chris Ruddy, activist and rapper Jasiri X and NFL Hall of Fame writer John Clayton, there was no unifying thread. This season brings together four national reporters to focus on the state of media in America today.
In addition to Mr. Folkenflik, Nathaniel Rich, novelist and New York Times Magazine writer-at-large, will speak Feb. 21 at the Highmark Theatre. He authored the Times' remarkable interactive feature "Losing Earth," which starkly outlines society's failure to stop climate change.
Also on board is Melissa Block (March 19, PNC Theatre), an NPR special correspondent and former host of "All Things Considered." NPR political correspondent Don Gonyea (May 9, Highmark Theatre) will close out the series.
Mr. Folkenflik described the "dizzying, bewildering array of events and stories and trends and dynamics playing out in front of us" as providing more than enough topics for him on any given day. Journalists are working harder than ever but finding roadblocks in many ways, from politicians declaring theoretical war on the so-called media "enemy of the people" to harsh economic realities.
"Two things stand out," he said. "One of which is that social media has hijacked how people consume news. . They are still consuming news that's even produced by traditional news organizations - and their digital cousins - but they are doing it through Facebook and Twitter and Reddit and other places.
"And when it comes to Facebook and Twitter and Google News, those are the guys who are monetizing this stuff, as opposed to [traditional outlets such as newspapers], who create it. And that's a huge problem.
"The second, of course, is that social media has added jet fuel to the claim attributed to almost everyone: that a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is just putting on its boots."
This "tsunami of information" is something "people have to wade and swim through."
And that can obscure the truth.
"We are constantly swimming in pixels, and it's just too much," he said.
But there's still an upside.
"There is also more good stuff, a hell of a lot of good stuff is available to you," he said. "The challenge of the journalist is to make it as clear and compelling and as trustworthy as possible."
For all its faults, Twitter, Mr. Folkenflik said, can be an extraordinarily useful tool. He processes daily reads of the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and Washington Post, among other traditional news sources, but bolsters his news intake by following certain journalists, a wide spectrum of politicians, activists, lawyers and policymakers.
"Even as it's a site swimming in abuse and vitriol and misinformation, I find that by trying to follow people I judge to be interesting and reliable, I can find an incredible amount of productive information," he said.
Mr. Folkenflik's event begins at 7 p.m. and tickets are $25. Prices vary from speaker to speaker, up to $50. For series subscription and meet-and-greet package information call the Playhouse box office at 412-392-8000 or go to pittsburghplayhouse.com.

Keto? Paleo? Whole30?

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: A U.S. Navy veteran has been imprisoned in Iran for nearly six months on unspecified charges, according to his family.

Michael White was slated to return to the U.S. on July 27 after visiting his girlfriend in Iran but never got on his flight from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, to the U.S., White’s mother Joanne White told the New York Times.

A missing person report was subsequently filed and Joanne White said she was notified several weeks ago that her son is alive in an Iranian prison.

“All I know is that he is alive and they were putting in a request for a consular visit by the Swiss,” she said, according to the Times. After the Iranian hostage crisis, U.S. interests in Iran have been represented by Switzerland’s Embassy.

The State Department did not contribute additional information but said security of U.S. citizens is the agency’s highest priority.

“We are aware of reports of the detention of a U.S. citizen in Iran,” the State Department told the Times. “We have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad. Due to privacy considerations, we have no additional information to provide at this time.”

According to CNN, at least five other Americans, some with dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, are detained in Iran.

Texto completo: I agree with The New York Times' warning to Nancy Pelosi not to give too much power to the newly elected House Democrats who call themselves "Democratic socialists." They will be a minority of the Democrats in the House.
I don't enjoy being unkind or insulting toward anyone, even the Republicans in Congress, a sizeable minority of whom are really scary "survival of the fittest" social Darwinists, but you have to be a complete idiot to call yourself a "Democratic socialist." That includes Bernie Sanders, who I like and agree with 90 percent of the time.
First, they are not true socialists because they do not advocate abolishing our capitalist economic system.
Second, if you believe that anyone who calls herself/himself a "socialist" can be elected president of the United States, then you must live in Dreamland.
I do agree with their belief that our federal government should do more and spend more to help the poor, the near-poor, the lower middle class and the middle class who are struggling to survive and to pay their bills. They need to inform and educate the public to the fact that almost every one of our traditional allies (if not all of them) have federal governments that do more and spend more (in proportion to their population sizes) than we do in the USA.
And, to paraphrase Al Pacino in the movie "And Justice For All," for us to be right about this, all of these other countries have to be wrong.
I don't think so.

Texto completo: At first, Roy J. Glauber thought it might have been a prank when the phone rang in his Arlington home at 5:36 a.m. in October 2005 and a voice with a Swedish accent said he would share that year's Nobel Prize in physics. “I could scarcely believe him," Dr. Glauber said hours later at a news conference.
His skepticism was understandable. At the time, Dr. Glauber was an 80-year-old Harvard University professor. The Nobel was for work he had done more than four decades earlier: an influential paper he published in 1963 that furthered the understanding of how matter and light interact.
Along with fielding congratulatory calls and speaking before a bank of cameras that October day, Dr. Glauber had other work he wouldn't set aside. A devoted and passionate teacher of students at all levels, he arrived right on schedule to teach “The Atomic Nucleus on the World Stage" — a freshman physics class.
Dr. Glauber, who had been recruited as an 18-year-old to join the Manhattan Project during World War II, and who was still at work last year, died Dec. 26 in Newton-Wellesley Hospital of respiratory failure. He was 93 and had lived in Arlington.
The Nobel committee said Dr. Glauber's half of the 2005 physics prize was “for his contribution to the quantum theory of optical coherence." John L. Hall and Theodor W. Hansch shared the other half “for their contributions to the development of laser-based spectroscopy."
Dr. Glauber's research “helped clarify how light could have both wave and particle characteristics, and explained the fundamental differences between the light emitted by hot objects, such as electric light bulbs, and the light emitted by lasers," The Optical Society said in a memorial tribute that is posted online.
Known for his humor in and out of the classroom, Dr. Glauber added a little levity to the beginning of his Nobel lecture, when he accepted the award two months after being awakened by that early-morning call.
“We have had light quanta on earth for eons, in fact ever since the good Lord said, 'Let there be quantum electrodynamics' — which is a modern translation, of course, from the biblical Aramaic," he quipped.
For many years, Dr. Glauber was also a regular at the irreverent Ig Nobel Prize ceremony at Harvard, where annual awards recognize quirky scientific achievements. He was the keeper of the broom — sweeping paper airplanes from the stage — and sometimes handed out the prizes.
The Mallinckrodt professor of physics emeritus at Harvard, Dr. Glauber taught there and at other schools for more than 65 years. He attended a conference in Barcelona just last summer, and “literally only retired from Harvard last year," said his daughter, Valerie Glauber Fleishman of Newton.
Into his 90s, Dr. Glauber still accepted interview requests from young students who were preparing science or history projects — he spoke with some of them via Skype. “He just loved supporting young people and he was completely dedicated to advancing education and science," his daughter said.
Although “some professors will only teach graduate students, he taught undergraduates, he taught freshman core curriculum courses, he even taught in the extension school," said his son, Jeffrey Glauber of Doylestown, Pa.
At one point, Dr. Glauber gave lectures one night a week to students from 24 high schools, providing “a panoramic view of the structure of light and of matter." It was a version of Harvard's “waves, particles, and the structure of matter" core curriculum course for non-science majors. “The course itself is not intended to be very formal; it is meant to be as enjoyable as it is instructive," he told the Globe in 1988.
Indeed, Dr. Glauber “always turned teaching into a production," his son said. “He would bring in the Harvard band to play, and then show on the screen the waves of their music, and what it looked like. He brought science to life."
The older of two children, Dr. Glauber was born in New York City on Sept. 1, 1925. His father, Emanuel Glauber, was a traveling salesman. His mother, Felicia Fox, had studied to be a teacher.
In his early boyhood, “we rarely spent more than two days in any one town, mostly in the eastern US," he said in a 2013 interview for Voices of the Manhattan Project, run by the Atomic Heritage Foundation and the Los Alamos Historical Society. “And my only playmate, my only companion at the time, was my mother."
Because of her education background, “she was teaching him as they went from city to city," Dr. Glauber's son said.
When Dr. Glauber's sister was born, the family settled in New York City, living at various times in Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx.
Dr. Glauber was in the first class to graduate from the Bronx High School of Science, and he received an award for outstanding achievement. Several months earlier, he had created telescopes for a science contest. His prize was a trip to the Pittsburgh manufacturing plant of Westinghouse, The New York Times reported.
Having skipped a couple of grades, he turned 16 in the fall of 1941 as he entered Harvard. In October 1943, when Dr. Glauber was barely 18, “a stranger in a dark suit appeared in the physics department office evidently asking for me," he wrote in his Nobel biography. The man offered the chance to engage in “interesting work" somewhere “out west."
That turned out to be the Manhattan Project. Dr. Glauber worked in the theory division and witnessed the Trinity Test of the first nuclear weapon. He recalled seeing the bomb's flash “and some of the glow that followed from a distance of over a hundred miles."
After the war, he returned to Harvard and graduated with a bachelor's degree and a doctorate. J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the Manhattan Project, invited Dr. Glauber to conduct postdoctoral research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., where he met and spoke with Albert Einstein. “Our paths thus crossed quite a few times," Dr. Glauber said in his Nobel lecture, in which he included a photo he had shot of Einstein during an encounter in 1951.
The following year, Dr. Glauber returned to Harvard, which was his academic home the remainder of his life.
In 1960, he married Cynthia Rich. They had two children and their marriage ended in divorce in 1975. Subsequently, he raised his children as a single parent, an experience he described as “immensely rewarding."
“I'm sure there is some number of papers I never got to write as a result," he wrote in his Nobel biography, “but raising those children and seeing them succeed was not an experience I would trade for the missing papers or any sort of recognition."
A private burial will be held for Dr. Glauber, who in addition to his children leaves his sister, Jacqueline Gordon of San Juan Capistrano, Calif.; Atholie Rosett of Cambridge, his girlfriend during his final 13 years; and five grandchildren.
Modest despite his many accomplishments, Dr. Glauber wore lightly the honor of winning many prestigious awards, topped by the Nobel.
“I just received a telephone call, believe it or not, from Stockholm," he said in a phone message he left for his daughter a few minutes after he was awakened in October 2005. He chuckled and said: “It's a little too much to believe. I've just won the Nobel Prize."
Dr. Glauber added that he had won half the prize and then, rather than talk about himself, praised his fellow scientists instead. “Ted Hansch and John Hall have, between them, won half the prize," he said. “I would have told you they had done a lot more than I've done."

Resumen: Maybe, much like Charles Dickens? "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity; it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness; it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair; we had everything before us, we had nothing before us; we were all going directly to Heaven, we were all going the other way." - What will you choose? 'Nattering nabobs of negativism' Vice President Spiro Agnew is famously quoted, but it was a Nixon speechwriter, later turned columnist for the New York Times, William Safire who created the quote. The best resolution you can make for a new year is to change the conversation in your head and become a "Perpetual purveyor of positivity!" I'll take credit for this quote.

Texto completo: The endless possibilities of 2019 are upon us. I am looking forward to this new year with optimistic enthusiasm and a belief that 2019 will be my best year ever. How about you?
Let's look back at our passing year. How would you describe your 2018? Maybe, much like Charles Dickens?
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity; it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness; it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair; we had everything before us, we had nothing before us; we were all going directly to Heaven, we were all going the other way." - Charles Dickens, "A Tale of Two Cities."
It seems like Dickens was describing our 2018. Now that I think about it, it sounds like every year of my life.
There is good and bad and positive and negative in every situation. It is always a matter of perspective. Some see light while others see darkness. Others see progress while others see failure.
What we see when we look at any life situation is a matter of choice. I always choose to find the optimism in every situation. To do otherwise is self-defeating.
So, for me, I choose to focus on the best of 2018, while I enter 2019 believing it will be even better. That is my choice. What will you choose?
'Nattering nabobs of negativism'
Vice President Spiro Agnew is famously quoted, but it was a Nixon speechwriter, later turned columnist for the New York Times, William Safire who created the quote. He put the words into the vice president's mouth as a response to Agnew's treatment by the press.
How you choose to look back at 2018 will largely color how you see 2019. Are you a "Nattering nabob?"
It's easy to make plans and resolutions for the year that is a blank slate, but reality sets when it occurs to you the resolutions you make only happen if you make them so. Then the voices in your head remind you that last year was the worst of times and that life is stacked against you. Those same voices will tell you that your resolutions are not possible and that if you try, you will only fail. With this kind of rhetoric bouncing around in your head, unchallenged by positive resistance, you drop your resolutions and you are off to another year.
Here's the dirty little secret. If you listen closely, you will realize that the voices of negativity in your head sound just like yours. The best resolution you can make for a new year is to change the conversation in your head and become a "Perpetual purveyor of positivity!"
I'll take credit for this quote. I was raised in a positive home. I was taught to look for the good and the positive in every situation. I understand that others were not, but as I have said many times in this column, optimism is a choice we make. You choose to be the nattering nabob of negativity or the perpetual purveyor of positivity. The first choice encourages depression and failure, while the second choice creates happiness, optimism and encourages success.
That voice in your head will try to convince you otherwise, but 2019 can be an outstanding year in your life. I am not talking about looking at life through rose-colored glasses. I am not asking you to pretend that the negative doesn't exist. Good and bad coexist on this earth, but it doesn't mean we have to engage in both. Choose to believe you can, not that you can't. Make the choice and commitment that 2019 will be your best year ever.

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.

Stock market: Worried about markets? Remember 'V' is for victory

Texto completo: The key to investing success in 2019 is remembering that "V" is for victory.
December was wretched for stocks, but it's over. As I detailed last week , stocks always bounce after extreme nasty stretches. And they do so in a near-perfect V-shaped pattern, it's merely a question of when. You’ve survived the left side of a V: the terrifying slide. Soon stocks will rocket up the V’s right side, if they haven’t already started.
So let's talk about the V's left side. Last week, I said December’s market action seemed like “mass forced institutional liquidations” – shuttering hedge funds scrambling for cash by year end. There isn’t good data on this, but hundreds of hedge funds closed Dec. 31 after botching three straight years. Most were bearish in 2016 and 2017, fearing Trumpageddon. They lagged terribly as U. S. stocks rose 36. 4 percent. Then they reversed in 2018, swinging uber-bullish, and getting hammered as stocks fell after September.
The hedge fund business model makes these long, lagging stretches challenging to recover from. The funds are paid largely through a 20 percent fee on any gains above some contractually detailed “high-water mark” in the value of the investments. That mark doesn’t ever reset when asset values fall. If they get too far underwater and can’t get back above it before long, continuing isn’t worthwhile. Their self-interest becomes closing shop and starting fresh later. Hence this year’s unusual stampede for liquidating cash by year end.
Then, too, most hedge funds let their investors leave only at contractually specified periods. So many surviving funds likely felt forced to raise cash, anticipating disappointed investors fleeing right about now, when redemption windows open. The result: Mass December selling, which prioritized speed over price. Imagine hundreds of folks in a one-door room. One yells “FIRE!” They all start stampeding together. That was most of December.
They seemingly were largely done liquidating by Dec. 26, when stocks rose 5 percent. That may have reflected others who earlier, expecting more of the same, had sold short (selling un-owned, borrowed shares) to profit from expected further declines but got pinched by the rebound. If so, the V’s right side is likely underway now.
Last year reminds me of 2011. Few recall, but stocks had a full-scale 2011 correction from May to October. Using closing prices, the Standard & Poor's 500 fell 19. 4 percent. Bear market dread abounded that October, like now. Then came the V. By Feb. 24, 2012, stocks hit new highs, after a 24. 2 percent rise. Now 2011’s correction is largely long forgotten.
This time, starting in October, the S&P 500 fell 19. 8 percent from peak to trough (using closing prices). That's almost big enough for a bear market (a 20 percent fall). Absent another big downdraft, it was a big 2011-like correction. Many will forget it – like most have long forgotten this bull market’s prior five global corrections. They’re painful in the short term but fade fast from memory, making them blips on a chart. The aftermath is always the V’s right side – a big rebound.
Before I got promoted in 2017 to USA TODAY, I wrote columns for Forbes for 32½ years. My Jan. 29 and Oct. 15 2009, columns detailed exactly how the V would work following that biggest, ugliest bear market since the Great Depression. Read "Anticipate the V" and "Viva The V" .
So believe in the V. Own stocks! The stock market is amazingly resilient, and always will be, because humanity is resilient. Don’t bet against us.

Democrats see climate change as 2020 opportunity

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Environmental advocates say now is the time for decisive action on climate change.
Democrats won the House in November riding a platform that included a call to address the crisis. Global warming was blamed for intensifying natural disasters that killed dozens and cost billions of dollars across the country in 2018. A recent avalanche of evidence that the climate is already changing radically has hardened the case for immediate action.
"Climate change is here and now. And palpably getting worse. That is rapidly changing how Americans think about it," David Doniger with the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote in a recent blog. "The shift from 'future problem' to 'now crisis' is being fueled by blockbuster scientific reports and blockbuster real-world catastrophes."
And yet few – including Doniger – expect Washington to do much any time soon in the dramatic way scientists are urging.
President Donald Trump, who last year yanked the U.S. out of the Paris Accord on climate change, continues to doubt the science and says radical action would only hurt the economy. At an international climate conference in Poland in December, his emissaries doubled down on the expansion of fossil fuels, notably coal.
And while incoming House Democratic leaders vow to make climate change a priority when they take control in January, their most ambitious proposals are expected to die in the GOP-controlled Senate, where Republicans remain resistant to far-reaching steps aimed at weaning the nation off carbon.
So for Democrats and their environmental allies, the next two years in Washington are likely to be more about making a case to voters than actually scoring significant victories on climate change, said Bob Shrum, a longtime Democratic strategist who teaches political science at the University of Southern California.
"I don't think Trump's going to give an inch on this," he said. "I think we'll be at a stalemate (for the next two years). But I think Democrats can prepare the ground, can win the argument and can go into 2020 on these issues in a pretty strong position."
Studies suggest there isn't much time for politicking on the issue. Some of the effects are already taking place, according to a landmark climate assessment the administration released in November.
Climate change is contributing to extreme weather conditions, the spread of new diseases by insects and pests and changes to the availability of food and water, the researchers say.
But the dire warning has done little to prod Capitol Hill Republicans, many of whom still question the science behind climate change.
Reluctant to cross Trump, they barely discuss the issue these days compared to three years ago, according to an analysis of press releases, floor statements, tweets and Facebook posts by software firm Quorom.
When Republicans do talk about it, the refrain is that innovation and incentive alone can solve the issue. One of the most notable achievements they tout was passage of a tax credit to encourage the capture and storage of carbon emissions into the ground before they become airborne and contribute to global warming.
But they roundly oppose dramatic steps, such as a carbon tax, to cut the nation of fossil fuels because it would increase the cost of energy.
Wyoming GOP Sen. John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and a sponsor of the carbon capture legislation, opposes such "punishing regulations.
"Making energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs to consumers will be accomplished through investment, invention and innovation," Barrasso wrote in a column for The New York Times.
Experts on climate change firmly disagree.
With carbon capture, clean energy development and other advances, the reliance on fossil fuels must stop as well if the planet has any hope of meeting the net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 that scientists cite as a minimum to stave off the worst effects of a warming globe.
"That's a one-two punch we need to solve the climate crisis," said Conrad Schneider, advocacy Director for the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit organization pushing for carbon emission reduction. "Neither alone is going to get it done."
One of the few congressional Republicans willing to support a carbon tax is Florida Rep. Francis Rooney.
Representing one of the country's reddest districts, the former businessman from Oklahoma is a conservative on most issues. But on climate change, he is is an unflinching opponent.
"I don't think we need to burn coal," Rooney said. "A carbon tax is the most market-oriented, nonbureaucratic, efficient way I can see to kill off coal."
And Rooney said the intransigence most of his fellow Republicans, including President Trump, display on the issue is harmful to the GOP brand – and could come back to haunt them in 2020.
"We need to be reaching out to broaden our base, and if you look at this last election, our base is narrowing unfortunately," he said. "I talk to our kids and young people all the time, and they are more environmentally sensitive, they're more pro-alternative energy, they get the natural gas thing instead of coal."
Tom Steyer, the liberal California billionaire who is mulling a presidential run in 2020, believes climate change – and Republicans' refusal to follow experts' advice despite the dire warnings – will help Democrats sweep into office two years from now.
"When we talk about what's at stake here, we're talking about unimaginable suffering by the American people unless we solve the problem over the next 12 years," he said recently. " And I think that we're very far from doing that. And it is unclear to me that we can summon that will without having substantial political victories across the board."

Texto completo: Andre Berto, a two-time welterweight boxing world champion, is ready to go a few rounds in the Beverly Hills housing market. He's put his modern home in the area on the market for $8.995 million.
Built in 2016, the boxy two-story features 12-foot-high ceilings, wide-plank floors and an expansive terrace/patio that spans the upper level. About 4,900 square feet of interior includes an open-plan kitchen and dining area, a living room with a fireplace, five bedrooms and seven bathrooms.
The master suite, which has a private patio, is reached by a floating staircase.
The house sits on a third of an acre with lawn, mature landscaping and a swimming pool with a spa.
Berto, 35, has twice held the WBC welterweight title and won a bronze medal in 2003 at the World Championships in Bangkok. The Haitian American fighter, whose record is 32-5 with 24 knockouts, in August fought former welterweight champion Devon Alexander, winning the match by split decision.
Berto bought the Beverly Hills house a year ago for $6.62 million.
Shaye Sullwold of the Cosmopolitan Group holds the listing.
Designs on a new living space Adam Carolla is swapping styles in La Cañada Flintridge. A few months after listing his Midcentury spread for sale, the comedian has paid $7.327 million for a contemporary-style house in the area.
Designed by architect Vaughan Trammell and built in 2013, the house sits at the end of a leafy cul-de-sac. Clean lines, offset roof lines and clerestory windows create visual interest from the street. Inside, stone walls and hardwood floors fill some 7,300 square feet of living space.
At the heart of the home, a built-in fireplace warms an indoor-outdoor great room. Picture windows brighten the sky-lit dining room under vaulted ceilings. Other highlights include a step-down living room, a center-island kitchen, a movie theater, a gym and a wine cellar.
A dumbwaiter serves all three floors, which hold five bedrooms and six bathrooms.
Outside, the nearly one-acre property includes an infinity-edge swimming pool and spa, two fire pits and a grill. There's also a viewing deck.
In addition to his popular podcast, "The Adam Carolla Show," the 54-year-old Carolla has appeared on "The Man Show" and "Catch a Contractor." From 1995 to 2006, he co-hosted the syndicated radio show "Loveline."
Scott James of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage held the listing. Kathy Seuylemezian, also with Coldwell Banker, represented Carolla.
Desert segment comes to an end Sports talk radio host Jim Rome and his wife, Janet, have signed off in Indio, selling their Tuscan-inspired home in a resort community for $2.5 million.
The four-bedroom, five-bathroom house, built in 2009, sits on a lakefront lot of about two-thirds of an acre. Designed for outdoor entertaining, the home opens through a gated courtyard with patios and a fireplace. Pocketing walls of glass open to a rear patio with a dining area and a barbecue/bar.
A strip of sandy lakefront sits beyond the swimming pool, which has a raised spa. There's also a private boat dock with a lift.
Inside the single-story house, living spaces evoke Old World ambiance with thick beams, stonework and reclaimed teak wood and pavers imported from Tuscany and France. A great room with a fireplace adjoins a center-island kitchen. Nearby is a card/game room.
Rome, 54, has been a mainstay on radio airwaves since the mid-1990s with "The Jim Rome Show." More recently he hosted the premium cable sports-talk series "Jim Rome on Showtime" from 2012 to 2015.
He was one of 24 on-air personalities nominated earlier this year for the National Radio Hall of Fame.
Jenell VanDenBos of Bennion DeVille Homes represented both ends of the deal.
A full-floor production in NYC Fashion mogul and film producer Sidney Kimmel is looking to make a move on the opposite coast.
More than a year after listing the former Johnny Carson estate in Malibu, Kimmel and his wife, Caroline, have put their New York City apartment up for sale at $39.5 million.
The roughly 6,800-square-foot residence makes up the entirety of the 27th floor of the Thierry Despont-designed Ritz-Carlton New York residences.
Beyond a bronze entry, the unit opens to a gallery that connects each wing. A central bar area connects the living room, which has an antique fireplace, to the wood-paneled office. The corner dining room sits adjacent to the kitchen and has picture windows that capture views of Central Park and the Upper West Side.
On another wing, the master suite — measuring some 2,000 square feet — comprises two onyx and marble-clad bathrooms, two dressing rooms, a private office and a sitting room. There are two bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms in all.
Sidney Kimmel, 90, is the founder of Jones Apparel Group. His film producing credits include "Moneyball" (2011), "The Place Beyond the Pines" (2012) and "Hell or High Water" (2016).
He was an executive producer for the 2018 blockbuster "Crazy Rich Asians," a film based on the Kevin Kwan novel of the same name.
The producer and his wife bought the property in 2001 for $22.343 million. Earlier this month, the couple took their Malibu property off the market. It had been listed at $65.2 million.
Steven Cohen, Robert Varvara and Tim Malone of Corcoran Group hold the New York City listing.
Readying for a new chapter Author Kristin Hannah has put her longtime home in Kauai, Hawaii, up for sale at $10.75 million.
The oceanfront contemporary sits on about half an acre in the desirable North Shore area. Built in 1998, the multilevel house features two offset wings, each with 9-foot-tall pocketing glass walls oriented toward the ocean. Balconies and patios on each level make the most of the coastal setting.
Inside, high ceilings and natural light create a feeling of spaciousness from room to room. The floor plan includes an ocean-view office, a great room with a fireplace, a wet bar, three bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. Custom Koa wood cabinetry stands out in the kitchen.
Outside, tropical landscaping and ocean views create a backdrop for a dining lanai. A swath of lawn sits between the house and miles of sandy beachfront.
Hannah has written more than a dozen novels including "Firefly Lane," "On Mystic Lake" and "The Nightingale," the latter of which was a New York Times bestseller. Her latest book, "The Great Alone," also made the New York Times list as both print and audiobook bestseller this year.
She bought the place more than a decade ago for $4.45 million, records show.
Ben Welborn and Tiffany Spencer of Hawaii Life hold the listing.
Swinging for a profit PGA Tour golfer J.B. Holmes has teed up his Florida home for sale at $2.15 million. That's $100,000 more than he paid for it four years ago.
Set lakeside on three-quarters of an acre, the two-story house expands to a glass atrium with a fountain-fed swimming pool with a spa, kitchen and fireplace. Inside, five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms are spread across 6,325 square feet of space.
Through a double-door entry, there's a foyer lined with tile and a two-story living room under wood-coffered ceilings. An elevator runs upstairs, where pocket doors in the master suite open to a covered lanai overlooking the pool. Other second-story living spaces include a movie theater and a loft with a wet bar.
The home was built in 2007. It's found in the Concession neighborhood outside Bradenton.
Holly Pascarella of Keller Williams Realty Select holds the listing.
Holmes, 36, boasts seven wins as a professional golfer, including four on the PGA Tour. The most recent came three years ago when he won the Shell Houston Open in a playoff with Jordan Spieth and Johnson Wagner.
Author Kirstin Hannah's oceanfront contemporary features two offset wings that are both oriented toward the sea. A dining lanai and other patios create additional living space outdoors.

Texto completo: Central Trumansburg's cozy coffee house is alive and well. The Village's Gimme! Coffee baristas are cordial and do not misspell your name on a paper cup. The place provides a perfect setting for meeting friends, sussing out the local and global political scenes, taking in the action on the street, or conducting research via the café's high-speed Internet connection. Oh, and coffee.
A short time ago we met at that very Gimme! with T'burg's Charles O. Dickerson High School English teacher Jane George, and two of the students in her Global Humanism Club and class, Orion Vogel-Moore and Maggie McCurdy. Ms. George has set her students on a powerful mission: to become active participants in learning about and working to help resolve United Nations (UN) defined human rights issues.
In March they hope to travel to New York City to participate in the Global Education Motivators (GEM) Student Leadership Conference on Development at the United Nations, meeting with delegates from the UN's Council on Human Rights along with students from a UN-affiliated high school and with others from international high schools.
Last year the Global Humanism class focused on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action. Students collaborated for three days, developing a plan of action, and T'burg students were elected to leadership roles as editors, facilitators and delegates. The plan of action was presented to and accepted by The United Nations Youth Envoy, and the presentation was streamed on the Internet; friends and family in California and Arizona reported that they enjoyed watching it live from so far away.
This year, as both class and club, the Trumansburg group will work with others to present findings and proposed actions in support of another of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, clean water.
But before they can get there, the students' immediate goal is to raise $10,000 to cover conference fees, transportation, and hotels, so that every involved student can afford to go, be part of the research and presentation team, and do a bit of topic-related sightseeing. If you'd like to support their mission, please send checks to the high school, 100 Whig Street, made out to the Global Humanism Club.
In addition to being an inspired and inspiring English teacher, Ms. George, who is a certified wildlife rehabilitator, has led the way for her students to get their wildlife rehab certification. "It's another way of working with natural resources," she explained. She said she enjoys working in the Trumansburg Community School District because the administration, which made it possible for her and for her students to form the Global Humanism Club ". . . lets us do what we do best: teach."
Big doings at the conservatory Mark Costa, arts coordinator for the Trumansburg Conservatory of Fine Arts, tells us that they will present innovative guitarist and composer Hiroya Tsukamoto, fusing folk, jazz, and world music on Friday, January 11 from 8:00-10:00 pm. According to Costa, Tsukamoto "takes us on an innovative, impressionistic journey filled with earthy, organic soundscapes that impart a mood of peace and tranquility."
Couple this with the Conservatory's new comfortable seating, and you've got a delightful experience ahead. What a great way to ease from the chaos of 2018 into what we hope will be a more peaceable 2019. Advance tickets are $15, available online at TCFA.live, or $18 at the door the day of the show. For a preview, check out Tsukamoto's web site, hiroyatsukamoto.com.
Trumansburg Rotary Speaker Series On Jan. 17, Todd Edmonds of the Trumansburg Community Recreation initiative will speak about that program's plans and needs. TCR's mission is to develop facilities and programs for community sports, recreation, and leisure in the Trumansburg area, thus helping to promote community members' health and vitality.
And on Jan. 24, Kimberly Bell, superintendent of the Trumansburg Community School District, will talk about plans for our school system in 2019 and beyond.
Trumansburg Rotary invites the public to its Thursday evening speaker series, at American Legion Post 770, at the corner of East Seneca Road and Route 96, just north of the village. The talks begin at 7 p.m.
Kudos to Finger Lakes Wineries It's nearly old news, but nonetheless thrilling: New York Times wine writer Eric Asimov gave a Thanksgiving shout-out to local wineries for their dry Rieslings. "Look for labels like Ravines, Hermann J. Wiemer, Anthony Road, Forge Cellars, Red Newt, Heart & Hands, Silver Thread and Bloomer Creek," he advised. We say you needn't confine your Finger Lakes selections to any one holiday. They'll light up your Sunday roast chicken dinner and your Easter ham, and will still be delicious when the longer days return, and you can enjoy them with the sunset show from your deck.
Brewery to open And in more recent news, the folks at Garrett's Brewery on the village's Main Street have finally gotten their license. Look for their opening any day now! Best to them, and to all of our readers in the New Year – may your year be filled with warmth, friendship, love, good food and drink, and the time to enjoy it all.

Trump Suggests Declaring National Emergency to Skirt Congress on Wall

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump raised the possibility on Friday of declaring a national emergency to allow him to build a wall along the southwest border without congressional approval, hours after Department of Homeland Security officials requested additional support to erect temporary barriers between the United States and Mexico.
Mr. Trump's comments followed a contentious meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House. It failed to produce a deal to end the two-week partial shutdown of the federal government, a funding lapse that began with the president's insistence that Congress allocate $5.6 billion for the wall.
"We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly," Mr. Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden when asked about an emergency declaration.
Asked if his claim was intended to scare Democrats into making a deal, he replied, "I never make threats."
[President Trump took the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms.]
Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, presidents are allowed to take unilateral action in times of crisis, provided they notify Congress, specify the circumstances that necessitated the declaration and document all uses of executive authority that are covered by the emergency.
Officials at the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense Departments have researched the issue for Mr. Trump. However, no emergency order has been drafted or approved, one official with knowledge of those plans said.
The Homeland Security Department submitted an official request for assistance from the Pentagon on Friday, a Defense Department official said. But the military has yet to determine what resources are needed and if any additional troops are required for the mission, the official said.
The moves come as the president finds himself trapped between a central campaign promise to build a wall and rising anxiety among Republicans over political damage inflicted by a shutdown that Mr. Trump has defiantly owned.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ruled out paying for a border wall, even at a much lower funding level, despite suggestions by Mr. Trump that the government shutdown could last "months or even years."
Administration officials have been scrambling to tackle the legal and logistical problems involved with steering previously allocated funding toward any project that can be described as a wall, a fence or a barrier.
The definition of a wall has grown ever more elastic.
The White House and homeland security officials have been pushing the Pentagon to continue to use military troops at the border -- mainly to install, extend and repair a section of concertina wire used to stop immigrants from entering unmanned sections of the southwest border.
Mr. Trump tweeted last month that "the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall" -- a reference to several hundred miles of fencing along the border.
The temporary troop deployments are just one of many recommendations that the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, and her staff have made to the Pentagon.
One possible solution, in the absence of new congressional allocations, is figuring out a way to steer contracts already planned for Army Corps of Engineers projects toward some kind of barriers. But lawyers at the Homeland Security and Justice Departments have yet to determine if doing so could withstand court challenges, two senior administration officials said.
Mr. Trump spent the holidays at the White House to demonstrate his determination to secure new border funding. Yet he has struggled to dramatize his cause, as stories of federal employees and other Americans suffering from the effects of the shutdown pile up.
On Thursday, homeland security officials abruptly canceled a scheduled press briefing by Kevin K. McAleenan, the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection, when Mr. Trump decided that he wanted to appear in front of the cameras himself. He did so, in the White House briefing room, with Border Patrol and other immigration enforcement employees who had been meeting with him in the Oval Office.
"It was completely off the cuff," Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in the room with Mr. Trump, said shortly after leaving the White House. "I don't know who in the room -- it may have been him -- that was like, 'We should go out there and do a presser.' So we did."
Mr. Del Cueto and other members of the Border Patrol's labor union have met with Mr. Trump several times in his presidency -- so frequently, they said, that they could not remember the number of times they had been to the Oval Office.
Separately, on Friday, Mr. Trump in a tweet denied as "FAKE NEWS" a New York Times article reporting that he was considering nominating former Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, as his next defense secretary. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned last month to protest Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria.

Title IX is under threat, even as 2018 is heralded as The Year of the Woman

Texto completo: NBC, CNN, Vox, The New York Times – the media is heralding 2018 as The Year of the Woman. Yes, women won seats in 2018 elections at record levels. But what’s happening underneath this political surge?
The president of the most influential nation on the planet has trumpeted pussy-grabbing. A nominee for the highest court in our land was credibly accused of sexual assault – and was confirmed for the position anyway, since boys will be boys. More than 200 major figures in television, movies, business, the media, politics, and sports were outed and ousted, but they were rarely prosecuted for their predatory behavior.
Rape occurs at epidemic levels in this country. In the United States, one in four women will be sexually assaulted during their lifetimes. In one recent 24-hour period alone, more than 12,000,000 women shared online #MeToo stories of their personal victimization.
In Minnesota, there were an estimated 6,915 rapes in 2015 – and 53 convictions, meaning that 6,847 rapes in that one year were never brought to justice. An AP report on Friday, Dec. 28, noted that, according to FBI data, the national “clearance rate” for rape cases fell to its lowest point since at least the 1960s because not enough resources are devoted to investigating sexual assault, the second-most serious crime in the FBI crime index.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 684,000 Minnesota women will be raped, stalked, or experience violence from an intimate partner in their lifetimes.
The Star Tribune’s recent series, “Denied Justice,” highlighted the egregious failures of Minnesota’s criminal justice system to take survivors’ experiences seriously, to treat survivors appropriately, and to commit to the same standards and procedures for investigation and prosecution of rape as with other crimes. There has now been a review of policies and practices throughout the state. This review described police disregard for, and in many instances, the outright humiliation of, survivors; the unwillingness to prosecute male perpetrators; and the appalling lack of appropriate services to address the lifelong physical and psychological trauma that these crimes create.
The anticipated outcome of this investigation is that Minnesota’s victimized women will receive some of the justice that they deserve.
But at the same time that this vital Minnesota self-scrutiny is occurring, the U.S. government is taking deplorable action that will reduce women’s willingness to come forward and will increase men’s impunity for sexual crimes against women.
Led by Betsy DeVos, secretary of the Department of Education, this is happening almost under the radar. What is she doing? Rolling back Title IX.
Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 is a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in any educational institution receiving federal funding. In 1994, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights applied the law to sexual assault on campuses. This requires universities to investigate and adjudicate sexual assault cases. However, the rates of assault on campus did not decline.
In 2009, a study looked at 10 years of sexual assault complaints filed under Title IX. The results? Students who were responsible for sexual assault faced almost no consequences. Disciplinary actions were minor: counseling, community service, probation, or even no action at all. Sexual assault survivors faced the harshest punishment: seeing their rapist on campus every day. Title IX was failing.
In 2011, the Obama administration issued a “Dear Colleague Letter” to reinforce the requirement that schools investigate sexual assault.
The goals were to set out victim-centered standards, encourage reporting, increase the availability of victim support services, and shift the campus culture to one that emphasizes consent for sexual activity.
The Dear Colleague Letter also established rights and protections for accused students, including due process, equal opportunity to present witnesses and evidence, timely access to information used in the hearing, an impartial investigation and hearing process, and an appeals process.
The Letter required schools to use a “preponderance of evidence” standard in deciding sexual assault cases. This standard sets the burden of proof as “more likely than not,” or more than 50 percent likely, that something occurred. This standard, used in civil cases and all discrimination cases, gives the benefit of the doubt to the victim.
In September 2017, DeVos announced that the Department of Education was rescinding the Dear Colleague guidelines and will establish new Title IX requirements.
The department issued interim guidelines that are likely to become permanent.
* Schools can decide sexual assault cases using either the “preponderance of evidence” standard OR a “clear and convincing evidence” standard, a stricter standard that will make it harder to hold perpetrators accountable for assaults.
* Colleges can use mediation in sexual assault cases. Mediation means that the accused and the accuser negotiate with a third person about how to resolve the case. Mediation is highly inappropriate. Sexual assault survivors should not have to “work through” their assault with the accused.
* Campuses can choose to offer an appeal process only to accused students, not to both parties. This gives the accused a significantly unfair advantage.
* The definition of sexual harassment is narrowed to exclude most off-campus assaults, even though many campus activities occur away from campus. This will greatly reduce the number of incidents actionable under Title IX.
These revised policies focus on the accused, not on the victims. These policies will intimidate victims from coming forward, make it harder to report harassment or assault, and will make it less likely that schools will provide victim services.
These proposed regulations are not official yet. They have to go through a public comment process that ends on Jan. 28. This comment period intentionally occurs over the period of schools’ winter breaks, when campus communities are less likely to be available to talk about Title IX.
Submit comments urging support of the Dear Colleague standards. To do so, go here.
The most helpful comments are personal stories of how the proposed regulations would have affected your life or the life of someone you know. This was the focus of the Star Tribune series as well: the personal, powerful story.
In October, 41 members of the House of Representatives in Washington introduced House Resolution 4030, known as the Title IX Protection Act. This would codify into law the Dear Colleague letter. This bill didn’t pass in the legislative session that ended on Jan. 2; there was no companion bill in the Senate.
Support a new bill. Ask Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith to introduce a bill like HR 4030 in the Senate. Call your representative in the House and ask him or her to re-introduce HR 4030. Use the toll-free number 844-872-0234 . Simply enter your ZIP code and you’ll automatically be connected to your senator and representative.
We hope to see a similar bill in the 2019 Minnesota legislative session.
Minnesotans are responding at the state level. We must not allow justice to be weakened by the federal government.

Texto completo: Q: Is "Orange Is the New Black" coming back with a new season? There are plenty of loose ends that could be tied up.
A: The Netflix series will be back in summer 2019 for a seventh season, which will also be its last. The end of the sixth season saw central character Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling) getting early release from prison and the seventh will include a look at her life on the outside. Executive producer Tara Herrman told The Hollywood Reporter her release will contrast with what nonwhite, less privileged inmates on the series will experience.

Q: I watch "The Honeymooners" all the time. One of the episodes is "Mama Loves Mambo." It's about a mambo instructor who moves into the building. Can you tell me the actor's name?
A: Charles Korvin played Carlos the mambo instructor. He was an actor who "made a career playing gentleman thieves and philandering husbands," The New York Times said after Korvin died in 1998 at age 90.
Born in Hungary and educated in France, he was also a documentary-maker and had a steady movie-acting career from 1945 until about 1951, co-starring with Merle Oberon in three movies, before he was caught up in the Hollywood blacklist. He then worked in TV, including on "The Honeymooners" and on "Zorro," returning to the big screen in 1965.

Q: What happened to the Australian actor who played Jack the Mountie on "When Calls the Heart"?
A: Daniel Lissing left the series when his contract ended, with Jack killed off on the series. Lissing said after the Jack's death episode aired that the decision to leave was "for reasons that are very personal to me" but did not elaborate, as ETonline.com noted.
He's still friendly with the cast, telling ET in November that he still talks almost daily with co-star Erin Krakow. He has been taking on other projects, such as the recent Hallmark movie "Christmas in Love," where he co-starred with Brooke D'Orsay.

Q: It's not fair that OWN canceled "Love Is" because of the executive producer. His wife is the producer! Please explain. It's not fair to the actors.
A: As you know, executive producer Salim Akil has been accused of assaulting actress Amber Dixon Brenner along with the claim they had a long affair; Akil is married to Mara Brock Akil, producer on "Love Is." Salim Akil reportedly called Brenner's accusations "totally untrue" while acknowledging a past relationship with Brenner. Still, OWN decided not to go ahead with a previous plan for a second season of the show.
The announcement of the cancellation noted that the series was "inspired by the real-life love story" of the Akils, which made some observers believe that the off-camera events tainted how people would view the characters on the show. As for the actors, Ebony.com noted that "cast and producers will still be paid for Season 2 due to contractual obligations established during the show's initial renewal."

Q: Freeform aired "The Santa Clause" and "The Santa Clause 3," but not "The Santa Clause 2." Was the movie banned for some reason? I can't recall seeing "Santa Clause 2" on any channel this season.
A: This is a question that has popped up from time to time for years, both about Freeform and its earlier incarnation, ABC Family. The short answer is the channel does not have the rights to the second film, and it has aired instead on other channels. This year, for instance, it was on AMC.

Woman runs and, like always, 'likability' a thing [Corrected 04/15/2019]

Texto completo: Moments after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced she's forming an exploratory committee for a 2020 presidential run, the country launched its own exploratory committee on her likability.
The most popular story on The Atlantic's website for much of Wednesday and into Thursday morning is headlined, "There's a Reason Many Voters Have Negative Views of Warren -- But the Press Won't Tell You Why." (Subhead: "The media have focused on her comparatively low approval ratings -- but not the misogyny that drives them.")
The article is well worth your time as we embark on a political season -- new Congress, growing crop of presidential hopefuls -- that's sure to be endlessly punctuated by the "l" word (likable).
("How does Warren avoid a Clinton redux -- written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?" Politico asked Monday.)
From the Atlantic article:
"Read enough news reports about Elizabeth Warren's declaration that she is running for president, and you notice certain common features," Peter Beinart writes.
"In its story on her announcement, The New York Times noted that Warren has 'become a favorite target of conservatives' and that, in a recent national poll, 'only about 30 percent (of respondents) viewed her favorably, with 37 percent holding an unfavorable view.' The Washington Post observed that Warren's claim 'that she was Native American' has 'come under relentless attack from Republican opponents.' It also quoted a Boston Globe editorial that called Warren 'a divisive figure.' On CNN, the election analyst Harry Enten suggested that Warren's 'very liberal record, combined with the fact that Donald Trump has already gone after her' has made her a -- you guessed it -- 'divisive figure' whose 'favorable ratings are not that high.'
"These observations are factually correct," Beinart continues. "But they also help create a false narrative. Mentioning the right's attacks on Warren plus her low approval ratings while citing her 'very liberal record' and the controversy surrounding her alleged Native American heritage implies a causal relationship between these facts. Warren is a lefty who has made controversial ancestral claims. Ergo, Republicans attack her, and many Americans don't like her very much."
A more accurate narrative, Beinart maintains, needs to include a discussion about our national discomfort with women who seek power.
"Women's ambition provokes a far more negative reaction than men's," he writes.
"For a 2010 article in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, two Yale professors, Victoria Brescoll and Tyler Okimoto, showed identical fictional biographies of two state senators -- one male and one female -- to participants in a study. When they added quotations to the biographies that characterized each as 'ambitious' and possessing 'a strong will to power,' the male state senator grew more popular. But the female state senator not only lost support among both women and men, but also provoked 'moral outrage.' "
We watch these findings play out time and again, Beinart writes, in the way we receive and talk about Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton and other women politicians, particularly those who push for progressive policies.
"The better explanation for why Warren attracts disproportionate conservative criticism, and has disproportionately high disapproval ratings, has nothing to do with her progressive economic views or her dalliance with DNA testing," he writes. "It's that she's a woman."
Put another way, "I Don't Hate Women Candidates -- I Just Hated Hillary and Coincidentally I'm Starting to Hate Elizabeth Warren."
That's the headline on a satirical McSweeney's essay by Devorah Blachor, published Wednesday, that rings laugh-so-you-don't-cry true.
"My hatred for Hillary wasn't diabolical," Blachor writes, adopting the voice of a fictional male voter. "I never bought into the whole pizzagate thing, or the whole Uranium One thing, or the whole spirit-cooking-she-drinks-blood-infused-Podesta-rice thing, and I never once believed she was the devil. I would see those posts and just be like, Huh, if people believe that stuff about her, she must be really terrible."
Blachor's fictional voter fancies himself an open-minded fellow.
"I'd love to see a female President," Blachor writes. "Just not Hillary Clinton. Or Elizabeth Warren. I am totally open to all other women leaders, but I have to admit that Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar are beginning to make me angry and I'm not sure why yet, but I know the reason will become clear soon, and I'm also wondering what they might look like if someone photoshopped their heads onto the bodies of prisoners and put them behind bars."
It's an interesting exercise to read the McSweeney's essay and the Atlantic piece side-by-side.
"When women politicians -- especially women politicians who embrace a feminist agenda -- overtly seek power, many American men, and some American women, react with 'moral outrage,' " Beinart writes. "They may not express that outrage in explicitly gendered terms, just as they may not express their anxiety about a black candidate in explicitly racial terms. They may instead cite DNA testing or hidden emails or San Francisco's cultural liberalism. Or they may simply say they find the candidate's mannerisms off-putting."
He calls on the media to "dig deeper: to interpret these specific discomforts in light of the deeper discomfort that Americans again and again express with ambitious women."
A worthy and essential challenge, and one that I hope voters will also take on when they consider what, exactly, they mean when they write off a candidate as unlikable.

Texto completo: Senator Bernie Sanders, Independent of Vermont, offered a public apology Wednesday night to female staffers who felt mistreated during his 2016 presidential campaign and said he was unaware at the time of allegations of sexual harassment and pay disparities.
"I certainly apologize to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately, and of course if I run, we will do better next time," Sanders said in a television interview.
The allegations have surfaced in multiple media reports as Sanders mulls a second bid for the Democratic nomination. During an appearance on CNN, he was asked about a New York Times story that detailed episodes of sexual harassment and demeaning treatment that women working for his campaign said were not sufficiently addressed.
Sanders said he was "very proud of the campaign we ran in 2016" but described an operation that "exploded" from just a few paid staffers to more than 1,200 employees in a matter of months.
"I am not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources, in terms of addressing the needs that I'm hearing from now, that women felt disrespected, that there was sexual harassment which was not dealt with as effectively as possible," Sanders told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
Sanders said safeguards were put in place during his 2018 campaign for reelection to the Senate.

Webb, former Democratic senator, could lead Defense
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering Jim Webb, former Democratic senator and Reagan-era secretary of the Navy, to be the next defense secretary, according to three officials, potentially bypassing more hawkish Republicans whose names have been floated to replace Jim Mattis.
Webb, an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War, is being considered as President Trump seeks to carry out campaign promises to withdraw US troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Those two decisions prompted Mattis to resign in late December, putting Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, in the top role in an acting capacity.
Representatives for Vice President Mike Pence and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney have reached out to Webb, one of the three officials said. Separately, a senior Defense Department official confirmed that Webb's name had been circulating at the White House. Those two and the third official all spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal discussions.
Webb did not respond to a request for comment.
New York Times
Justice checking on Zinke's truthfulness
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department's public integrity section is examining whether newly departed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke lied to his agency's inspector general investigators, according to three people familiar with the matter, a potential criminal violation that would exacerbate Zinke's legal woes.
Zinke, who left the Trump administration Wednesday, was facing two inspector general inquiries tied to his real estate dealings in his home state of Montana and his involvement in reviewing a proposed casino project by Native American tribes in Connecticut. In the course of that work, inspector general investigators came to believe Zinke had lied to them, and they referred the matter to the Justice Department to consider whether any laws were violated, the people familiar with the matter said.
The department's public integrity section has since been exploring the case, the people familiar with the matter said. The extent of its work is unclear, though the inspector general had questioned witnesses in an apparent attempt to scrutinize Zinke's account, one of the people said.
A spokesman for Zinke said Zinke voluntarily participated in two inspector general interviews about the Connecticut tribal matter and "to the best of his knowledge answered all questions truthfully."

Obama's 'Hamilton' track hits Billboard charts
Former president Barack Obama might be used to topping polls, but now he's charting new territory: He's a performer on a song that just hit Billboard's hot R&B songs chart. His performance on the remix of the "Hamilton" hit "One Last Time," featuring cast member Christopher Jackson and gospel singer BeBe Winans, made its debut at No. 22 on the list.
Obama and company dropped the track before Christmas as part of "Hamilton" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda's "Hamildrops," remixes featuring various celebrities, with proceeds going to charity.
The "One Last Time" entry is called the "44 Remix," on which Obama reads a passage from George Washington's farewell address.
Beating out the 44th president on the chart are some of his own friends, including John Legend and Stevie Wonder with "What Christmas Means to Me" at No. 16.

Jim Webb eyed for defense secretary

Texto completo: The Trump administration is reportedly eyeing former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb to be the next secretary of defense following the New Year's departure of Jim Mattis.

A Democrat who also served as secretary of the Navy during the Reagan administration, Webb has been contacted by representatives for Vice President Mike Pence and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, the New York Times reports. A senior Defense Department official also said the White House was weighing a nomination for Webb.

Webb has been a staunch critic of the Iraq War, and the position comes as President Trump announced his intent to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Syria. That move prompted Mattis to submit his resignation last month, and as of Jan. 1 Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is serving as acting secretary of defense.

Webb appears to have more common ground with Trump. For example, Webb opposed the Obama administration’s Iran nuclear deal, which put restraints on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling sanctions.

“The end result of this could well be our acquiescence in allowing Iran to develop a nuclear weapon,” Webb said in 2015.

Trump ultimately withdrew from the deal in 2018.

Webb did not respond to a request for comment from the New York Times.

Other candidates being considered by the White House include former GOP Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri, along with Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Julie Bloom, a deputy editor for national coverage for The Times, discussed the tech she's using.
As a deputy editor on the national desk, you oversee a lot of breaking news. What tech tools do you use to help?
Hurricanes. Shootings. Wildfires. Elections and earthquakes. I didn't think anything could be as crazy as the fall of 2017 in this country, but 2018 came pretty close.
I primarily oversee California and parts of the West, but also handle a lot of our coverage of major breaking news. With my colleagues on the desk and our boss, Marc Lacey, the national editor, we've developed a tool kit of sorts to handle these stories that are fast-moving and intense.
I feel like each day is a little like being caught in a batter's box without knowing when or where the balls are coming from, and that can be both exhilarating and exhausting. Technology certainly helps.
My phone is pretty much everything. It's kind of its own command center, and I can do almost everything on it except edit. For stories, I still need my laptop. Most of the reporters know that if they get a call from me at an odd hour, it usually means they're on their way to something awful, but the reason we can do what we do is that they are total pros. Nobody ever just hangs up and goes back to sleep.
In these cases, our job is to help them produce the best journalism possible in difficult situations and make sure they stay safe, too. I'm in awe of the reporters on National who are relentless and often put themselves in danger while covering tough stories with compassion. Unfortunately, we've done enough of them now that we kind of know what to do.
Recently, we had a ton of breaking news out of California, where the majority of my reporters are based. The combination of the shooting in Thousand Oaks and the wildfires was a good example of having to be really nimble. One of our California reporters, Jenny Medina, called me in what was the middle of her night to say she and a bunch of F.B.I. agents who were in Thousand Oaks after the shooting had been forced to evacuate their hotel because of the fires. You can never predict what's next, so you just have to be ready to switch gears and work with what you have.
In breaking news, I rely on Twitter and Dataminr, which monitors Twitter for newsworthy patterns, to keep track of developments. We're also paying attention to police scanners, local television and all forms of social media and trying to break and confirm our own scoops, too. The trick is being careful and fast at the same time. A lot of bad information gets out in the immediate aftermath, and you never want to get it wrong.
In the middle of any given story, reporters and I communicate using text messages, Slack, Signal, Gchat and phone calls. We often spin off a Slack channel just for one event and have an email set up for breaking news that teams of reporters feed to. Those are split up into a bunch of different Google docs that we keep building out simultaneously for, say, a profile or a piece just on weapons or victims. Stories are updated dozens of times. We're also watching search trends and adjusting headlines to make sure we're showing up first. On a big, big story we'll also send out multiple alerts with new developments.
Many of your reporters are based on the West Coast, while you are stationed in New York. How do you keep in touch with them and work with them on stories?
Even though it's a different time zone, we're still covering the news no matter when and where it happens. My reporters are all early risers, or they're becoming ones. We have regular calls where we brainstorm ideas, but most editing is a constant back and forth over email, Gchat and text, and that seems to work well.
We're fortunate because The Times has bureaus all over the place, so sometimes we hand off to Hong Kong or London and the editors there can help keep stories going.
Your contributors sometimes report stories from odd situations, like natural disasters. What tools do they use, and how do they get stories to you expediently?
For stories like wildfires or hurricanes, reporters often take satellite phones with them to make sure they can keep in contact when cell communication is down. But it doesn't always work. During the recent wildfires, one reporter, Julie Turkewitz, was one of the first to enter the fire zone in Paradise, Calif., with a team of forensic experts searching for remains, and we lost contact with her for a few hours right on deadline. Thankfully, she surfaced just in time.
Sometimes good old dictation is the best means of getting scenes and reporting in real time. Reporters are also well versed in filing from their cars, Waffle Houses or the side of the road. We've had a few instances in hurricanes when reporters have had to abandon their rental cars because they were flooding and get to safety and they still managed to file.
You are a Los Angeles native. In your view, how has tech changed California?
I grew up in the Los Angeles area and went to school at Berkeley and keep close ties to both parts of the state, and I go back a lot to see family. California is an endlessly exciting place for The Times to cover: It's the world's fifth-largest economy, at the forefront of all sorts of change, extremely complex and a hotbed of contradictions. I like to think of it more as its own country. Technology is obviously a big part of all of that, and we're a long way from when I was a teenager on AOL Messenger.
When you're not at work, what tech product do you use a lot?
I'm pretty low-tech in my nonwork life -- or I try to be. When you're responsible for news, it's hard to let go. I've tried everything from burying my phone under my kitchen sink to deleting certain apps on the weekend, but at a certain point you just relent and accept.
I think social media is a mostly necessary evil and try to avoid it when I'm not working, but I still haven't quit Instagram. Besides friends and family, I follow a lot of dancers and ballet companies -- remnants from a former life -- and museums, chefs and fashion designers. It's good to be reminded that there are people out there creating beautiful things, too.

Texto completo: In July, Daniele Gatti, one of the world's leading conductors, faced allegations that he forced himself on two singers.
A few days later, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam terminated his contract, saying a number of its female members had reported experiences "which are inappropriate considering his position as chief conductor."
Now, just months later, Mr. Gatti, who denies the allegations, is back. In December, he was appointed music director of the Rome Opera. A major Italian classical music magazine put him on its cover and named him among its people of the year.
In December 2017, Charles Dutoit, another star conductor, also found himself at the center of a sexual harassment scandal, which grew to include accusations of inappropriate conduct between 1985 and 2010. Mr. Dutoit denies the allegations. But major orchestras around the world, such as the Boston Symphony, severed ties with him.
Mr. Dutoit is now back, too. In September, he was named principal guest conductor of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic in Russia, and conducted at a festival in Switzerland.
The initial actions against the two men led many to feel that classical music was getting a grip on sexual harassment, especially following the firing of James Levine, the Metropolitan Opera's former music director, who was accused of sexual misconduct. But the rapid return of Mr. Gatti and Mr. Dutoit has led some to ask whether the cult of personality that surrounds maestros in a tradition-bound field has won out, particularly in countries like Italy and Russia where the reaction to #MeToo has been relatively muted.
There has been little public questioning of either conductor's return. In April, Anna Netrebko, the Russian soprano, initially dismissed the notion that the classical music world had a problem with sexual assault. "Nobody will ever force you to do anything, never," she told the British radio station Classic FM. "If you did it, it means that you allowed that."
Other allegations have drawn similar responses. In November, Nike Wagner, the great-granddaughter of Richard Wagner and the artistic director of Beethoven Fest in Bonn, Germany, said a German music professor, Siegfried Mauser, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was the victim of a "malicious scheme." (Ms. Wagner did not respond to a request for interview.) In the Netherlands, Pieter Jan Leusink, the founder of the country's Bach Choir, has been accused of sexual misconduct, but is giving major concerts.
Carlo Fuortes, the general manager of the Rome Opera, said in an email that there had been no prosecutions against Mr. Gatti and noted that the allegations go back 20 years. "We cannot sentence anybody without a regular prosecution. I believe this will be very dangerous," he said.
The orchestra examined the allegations, he added. But Jan Raes, the managing director of the Concertgebouw Orchestra, said in an email that the Rome Opera had not contacted him.
The St. Petersburg Philharmonic refused to answer questions about whether they had examined the allegations against Mr. Dutoit.
"I'm disappointed more in the classical music world than him, I guess," said Paula Rasmussen, an American singer who claims that, almost 30 years ago, Mr. Dutoit forced himself on her in a dressing room and shoved her hand down his pants. "No one's holding him out to explain or apologize," she added in a telephone interview. "This is why people don't come forward."
Anne-Sophie Schmidt, a former leading French soprano who said she had a similar experience while performing with Mr. Dutoit in 1995, said, "It proves classical music doesn't want to admit there's a problem." Mr. Dutoit called her into his dressing room, forcibly kissed her and grabbed her breasts, she said in a telephone interview.
"I get a few messages -- Facebook, emails -- from young singers thanking me for what I've done in speaking out," Ms. Schmidt said. "They say I can do it as I'm retired. They say it's happened to them, but they are afraid to speak."
Classical music is not the only field having to confront the question of whether men who faced #MeToo allegations should be allowed to resume their careers. Louis C.K. is back doing spots at comedy clubs not long after he admitted to inappropriate behavior, including masturbating in front of several women. But few in classical music seem eager to discuss these issues publicly.
The New York Times contacted 10 high-profile conductors and other leading classical music figures for comment but was told they were busy, on vacation or felt they did not know enough to comment. Nick Mathias of IMG Artists, which represents Vasily Petrenko, the Russian conductor who works across Europe, said Mr. Petrenko was busy, but added: "I really don't think it would be at all appropriate for Vasily, or any other conductor, to be commenting on senior conductors such as Dutoit or Gatti."
Nikolaus Pont, the general manager of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Munich, said in a telephone interview that the ensemble had decided to keep Mr. Gatti on for two concerts which he conducted in October, despite the allegations against him. But the whole process had involved two months' agonizing, and he still felt "discomfort" about it, he said.
Mr. Pont said he contacted the Concertgebouw for more details, but they would not provide any, for legal reasons. No one at the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra reported any problems with Mr. Gatti, and Mr. Pont said he could not find any official reason that the performances should not occur.
"It was a difficult decision, as the last thing you want to do is give the impression of wanting to cover anything up or play anything down," Mr. Pont said. The issue of sexual misconduct needs to be discussed more in classical music, he added, and not just in orchestras, but also in universities and academies. He referred to the case of Mr. Mauser, a former president of Munich's University of Music and Performing Arts, who was convicted on three counts of sexual coercion against a singer. In December, the university announced a ban on teaching in private rooms following the scandal.
Other German orchestras have considered working with Mr. Gatti. In December, the Berlin Philharmonic said two concerts with him in 2019 had been canceled because the conductor was unwell, but the orchestra did not rule out future engagements. A spokesman for the annual Wagner festival in Bayreuth, Germany, would not confirm or deny that it was considering inviting Mr. Dutoit to conduct the "Ring" cycle in 2020.
Alicia Berneche, a soprano who has made allegations against Mr. Gatti, said in a telephone interview that his return reminded her of Louis C.K.'s comeback. She said that Mr. Gatti grabbed her bottom and shoved his tongue down her throat on her first day of rehearsals at the Lyric Opera in Chicago in 1996.
"That was my first day at the Lyric," Ms. Berneche said. "That was my first experience with a major conductor. It changed me."
Both Louis C.K. and Mr. Gatti returned to public engagements only months after facing allegations, she noted, adding, "The question is when is the penance long enough?"

Harry Reid says Trump has 'no conscience,' and he would know

Texto completo: Harry Reid couldn’t hide the wonder in his voice.

The former Senate majority leader sat with the New York Times recently, one of those interviews elder statesmen do when their health is failing and their legacy needs solidifying. And when the conversation turned to President Trump, Reid spoke in critical terms but admiring tones. The reporter, Mark Leibovich, described “a hint of grudging respect.”

“Trump is an interesting person. He is not immoral but is amoral,” Reid said. “Amoral is when you shoot someone in the head, it doesn’t make a difference. No conscience.”

This is where, according to Leibovich, Reid caught himself and qualified.

“I think he is without question the worst president we’ve ever had,” Reid said. “We’ve had some bad ones, and there’s not even a close second to him.” He added: “He’ll lie. He’ll cheat. You can’t reason with him.”

With that, “a hint of wonder crept into his voice.” It was, Leibovich notes, as if Reid was describing some sort of beast, not above, but outside of the rules that constrain everyone else --everyone else, that is, except for Reid.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney will become Utah Sen. Mitt Romney on Thursday. This Republican enters the Senate, after losing the White House, perhaps in part because Reid lied, Reid cheated, and Reid refused to allow anyone to reason with him.

That isn’t libel of an old man. This is an accurate description of what Reid has since described as one of his finest accomplishments. It was 2012, and Romney was mounting what looked like an impressive challenge against then President Obama. So Reid went to the floor of the U.S. Senate and started lying. He said Romney hadn’t paid taxes in over a decade.

Except that Romney had indeed paid taxes. He released his tax returns showing how he paid the federal government $1.9 million in 2010 and more than $3 million in 2011. By then, though, it was too late. Reid’s lie had gained traction.

When politicians are exposed for their lies, normally they do one of two things. Either they ignore it, hoping their lie will cover itself up with time, or they insist quietly that they didn’t have all the relevant information at the time. Not Reid, though. He was proud when he got caught.

The fact checker at the Washington Post had given Reid four Pinocchios for his lie. Even PolitiFact, hardly a consistent arbiter of the truth, awarded him their “pants on fire” rating. But Reid didn’t mind. When CNN asked him four years later if what he did was wrong, the duplicitous elder statesman said with a smile, “Romney didn’t win, did he?”

Hence Reid’s wonder when describing Trump. The president isn’t some odd, norm-ruining, political specimen. He is an evolution of the say-anything, cheat-to-win mentality that Reid pioneered. The two are similarly amoral, and that's why Reid admires that quality so much in a politician.

Bernie Sanders apologizes to women staffers who felt sexually harassed, disrespected during 2016 campaign

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Wednesday he was not aware of sexual harassment and unequal pay complaints from staffers working on his 2016 presidential campaign.

"I was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case," Sanders, an independent Vermont senator who unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic Party's nomination against Hillary Clinton, told CNN when asked whether he knew of the problems at the time.

Sanders' comments come after more than two dozen former male and female aides wrote a letter to the senator and his top advisers in which they requested a meeting to discuss how a prospective 2020 campaign could avoid the same issues experienced in 2016. The letter was first reported by Politico on Sunday.

“In recent weeks there has been an ongoing conversation on social media, in texts, and in person, about the untenable and dangerous dynamic that developed during our campaign,” the group, which includes field organizers to senior advisers, wrote.

The aim of the sit-down is to draft a statement from Sanders on the subject, to establish "concrete" policies and procedures, and to secure a commitment to "diverse leadership to pre-empt the possibility of replicating the predatory culture from the first presidential campaign” in 2020, they said in the letter.

On Wednesday, Sanders, who has been teasing a second bid for the White House, said he was "very proud" of the 2016 campaign they built.

"I think we started with three or four paid employees and, over a period of a few months as the campaign exploded, we went up to I think 1,200 employees," he told the network. "And I'm not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources, in terms of addressing the needs that I'm hearing from now that women felt disrespected, that there was sexual harassment which was not dealt with as effectively as possible."

"What I will tell you is that when I ran for re-election in 2018 in Vermont, we put forward the strongest set of principles in terms of mandatory training, in terms of women, if they felt harassed, having an independent firm that they can go to," Sanders said. "And I think that's kind of the gold standard for what we should be doing. So I certainly apologize to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately. And of course, if I run, we will do better next time."

The letter did not detail any specific incidents, but Giulianna Di Lauro, a Sanders Latino outreach strategist, told the New York Times on Wednesday she was harassed by a Mexican game show host and Sanders surrogate she drove to Nevada campaign events. Marco Antonio Regil, the host, had asked to touch her "beautiful curly hair.”

Regil told the newspaper he regretted "any interactions or behavior on my part that could’ve made anyone feel uncomfortable."

Samantha Davis, the former Texas and New York director of operations and an alumna of the campaign’s advance team, told the Times her supervisor "marginalized" her after she refused to visit him in his hotel room.

Women also complained to the paper about having to share staffer housing accommodations with men and being paid thousands of dollars less than their male colleagues.

Texto completo: Ariana Grande wants to be clear: Despite what you might have heard, she's taking a break from the dating scene.
Buzz among fans arose Tuesday from a headline: "Who Is Ariana Grande Dating NOW?!" after the pop star was spotted with ex Ricky Alvarez. The two dated for about a year and called it quits in July 2016. He's one of the four exes Grande names in her November single, "Thank U, Next. "
"Wrote some songs about Ricky / Now I listen and laugh," she sings.
Grande was quick to debunk the speculation.
"can they tell me too?" she tweeted.
A fan later joked about dating Grande, but she continued to brush off romance rumors.
"spoiler. it's me!" the fan wrote.
But Grande wasn't having it: "spoiler for the rest of this year / probably my life: it’s no one. please refer back to this tweet for future questions. "
The 25-year-old singer has been vocal about taking a break from love following her public split from "Saturday Night Live" comedian Pete Davidson in October. The following month, Grande released "Thank U, Next," in which she teases a new relationship, before revealing she's actually talking about herself.
"I met someone else / We havin' better discussions / I know they say I move on too fast / But this one gon' last / 'Cause her name is Ari / And I'm so good with that," she sings.

Davidson recently performed a stand-up routine in which he revealed he cried to his mother after the couple called it quits.
"Usually, breakup songs you know who it's about but you don't really know," Davidson said, according to E! News and The New York Times. "Bam. She named all of us. "
He also recalled the day "Thank U, Next" was released, just hours before he was supposed to perform on "SNL. " In the single, Grande mentions Davison by name: "Even almost got married / And for Pete, I'm so thankful. " The comedian recalled it being a "sad day. "
"That (expletive) came out before I had to put on a (expletive) duck hat and be like, 'derrrp here's the pizza!' So all my friends were there. …We didn't know it was going to happen," he said, according to E!

Dems to take climate change stand

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Environmental advocates say now is the time for decisive action on climate change.
Democrats won the House in November riding a platform that included a call to address the crisis. Global warming was blamed for intensifying natural disasters that killed dozens and cost billions of dollars across the country in 2018. Recent evidence that the climate is already changing radically has hardened the case for immediate action.
"Climate change is here and now. And palpably getting worse. That is rapidly changing how Americans think about it," David Doniger with the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote in a recent blog. "The shift from 'future problem' to 'now crisis' is being fueled by blockbuster scientific reports and blockbuster real-world catastrophes."
And yet few – including Doniger – expect Washington to do much any time soon in the dramatic way scientists are urging.
President Donald Trump, who last year yanked the U.S. out of the Paris Accord on climate change, continues to doubt the science and says radical action would only hurt the economy. At an international climate conference in Poland in December, his emissaries doubled down on the expansion of fossil fuels, notably coal.
And while incoming House Democratic leaders vow to make climate change a priority when they take control in January, their most ambitious proposals are expected to die in the GOP-controlled Senate, where Republicans remain resistant to far-reaching steps aimed at weaning the nation off carbon.
So for Democrats and their environmental allies, the next two years in Washington are likely to be more about making a case to voters than actually scoring significant victories on climate change, said Bob Shrum, a longtime Democratic strategist who teaches political science at the University of Southern California.
"I don't think Trump's going to give an inch on this," he said. "I think we'll be at a stalemate (for the next two years). But I think Democrats can prepare the ground, can win the argument and can go into 2020 on these issues in a pretty strong position."
Studies suggest there isn't much time for politicking on the issue. Some of the effects are already taking place, according to a landmark climate assessment the administration released in November.
Climate change is contributing to extreme weather conditions, the spread of new diseases by insects and pests and changes to the availability of food and water, the researchers say.
But the dire warning has done little to prod Capitol Hill Republicans, many of whom still question the science behind climate change.
Reluctant to cross Trump, they barely discuss the issue these days compared to three years ago, according to an analysis of press releases, floor statements, tweets and Facebook posts by software firm Quorom.
When Republicans do talk about it, the refrain is that innovation and incentive alone can solve the issue. One of the most notable achievements they tout was passage of a tax credit to encourage the capture and storage of carbon emissions into the ground before they become airborne and contribute to global warming.
But they roundly oppose dramatic steps, such as a carbon tax, to cut the nation of fossil fuels because it would increase the cost of energy.
Wyoming GOP Sen. John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and a sponsor of the carbon capture legislation, opposes such "punishing regulations.
"Making energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs to consumers will be accomplished through investment, invention and innovation," Barrasso wrote in a column for The New York Times.
Experts on climate change firmly disagree.
With carbon capture, clean energy development and other advances, the reliance on fossil fuels must stop as well if the planet has any hope of meeting the net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 that scientists cite as a minimum to stave off the worst effects of a warming globe.
"That's a one-two punch we need to solve the climate crisis," said Conrad Schneider, advocacy Director for the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit organization pushing for carbon emission reduction. "Neither alone is going to get it done."
One of the few congressional Republicans willing to support a carbon tax is Florida Rep. Francis Rooney.
Representing one of the country's reddest districts, the former businessman from Oklahoma is a conservative on most issues. But on climate change, he is is an unflinching opponent.
"I don't think we need to burn coal," Rooney said. "A carbon tax is the most market-oriented, nonbureaucratic, efficient way I can see to kill off coal."
And Rooney said the intransigence most of his fellow Republicans, including President Trump, display on the issue is harmful to the GOP brand – and could come back to haunt them in 2020.
"We need to be reaching out to broaden our base, and if you look at this last election, our base is narrowing unfortunately," he said. "I talk to our kids and young people all the time, and they are more environmentally sensitive, they're more pro-alternative energy, they get the natural gas thing instead of coal."
Tom Steyer, the liberal California billionaire who is mulling a presidential run in 2020, believes climate change – and Republicans' refusal to follow experts' advice despite the dire warnings – will help Democrats sweep into office two years from now.
"When we talk about what's at stake here, we're talking about unimaginable suffering by the American people unless we solve the problem over the next 12years," he said recently. " And I think that we're very far from doing that. And it is unclear to me that we can summon that will without having substantial political victories across the board."

Tiffany Haddish won't give up fur until police 'stop killing black people'

Texto completo: Tiffany Haddish, the comedian and actress who appeared in films including "Girls Trip" and "Keanu," is outraging animal rights activists with an Instagram video vowing to keep wearing furs until police "stop killing black people."

Haddish, who posted a clip in which she's wearing a fur vest given to her by a fan after a show at the Comedy Store in West Hollywood, Calif., said she's protesting deaths of minorities in policy custody. Such cases garnered national scrutiny after incidents including the shooting death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray in Baltimore in 2015, which prompted riots.

In 2018, an off-duty Dallas officer fatally shot 26-year-old accountant Botham Shem Jean when she mistook his apartment for her own, and 22-year-old Stephon Clark was shot dead in his grandmother’s backyard by police investigating property damage in Sacramento, according to the New York Times. An officer was fired in six of 15 prominent cases over a three-year period but only convicted at trial in three, the news organization said.

"When the police stop killing black people, I’ll stop wearing fur," Haddish said in her Instagram video, replayed more than 1 million times so far. "It's my new protest. Sorry, PETA, don’t be mad at me, be mad at the police."

PETA, or People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, didn't immediately respond on its Instagram feed, but Haddish drew plenty of criticism elsewhere.

"Every single police shooting case is different," one Instagram user said in response. "I would not want to be one of the guys to run into a dark room looking for a known killer. The police do it every day!"

Time of the year to admit to goofs, sloppiness

Resumen: In a January column on fallout from an inordinate number of retirements from the Pennsylvania Legislature (though, in my view, there can never be enough), I omitted two lawmakers worthy of note. In May, ahead of the GOP gubernatorial primary (which now seems 10 years ago), I wrote a column asking “do you believe in miracles?” Could Pittsburgh lawyer Laura Ellsworth — a sensible, civil, impressive candidate, vastly outspent by her opponents 2018 — pull off a political miracle and beat Scott Wagner and Paul Mango for the party nomination. [...]since it’s likely the next governor signs or vetoes anti-abortion bills, I suggested that “begs the question” of how the issue impacts the governor’s race. (Yes, there are some.) In referring to legislation he got enacted to increase transparency in investigations of sexual assault on college campuses, I wrote that all notices of disciplinary action must go to both “victims and accusers.”

Texto completo: Those of us with a public voice, with the privilege of opining for a living, also have a responsibility, I believe more rigid than most, to get things right — and fess up when we don’t.
So, as is my practice at the close of each year, I admit to goofs I made in columns.
I hate mistakes. Even small ones. They taint a viewpoint. They mar a message. They further crack the media’s already-fragile (especially these days) credibility.
Yet, despite my efforts to achieve factual flawlessness in 2018, I made mistakes, and here they are.
In a January column on fallout from an inordinate number of retirements from the Pennsylvania Legislature (though, in my view, there can never be enough), I omitted two lawmakers worthy of note.
I left out Rep. Bob Godshall, a Wharton grad and gentleman, who served Montgomery County 36 years; and Bucks County’s Scott Petri, who left the House after 14 years for the Philly Parking Authority (talk about going from pan to fire).
My error was corrected online and in print. But it was a sloppy sin of omission.
Then came a sports flub.
In May, ahead of the GOP gubernatorial primary (which now seems 10 years ago), I wrote a column asking “do you believe in miracles?”
Could Pittsburgh lawyer Laura Ellsworth — a sensible, civil, impressive candidate, vastly outspent by her opponents 2018 — pull off a political miracle and beat Scott Wagner and Paul Mango for the party nomination.
I referred to the 1980 “Miracle on Ice,” the underdog U.S. hockey team’s upset of the Soviet team at the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, giving sports broadcaster Al Michaels a place in history: “Do you believe in miracles?! YES!!”
But I wrote that the upset won gold for the USA. Wrong. The game was a medal-round game. And the USA did win gold. But it did so by later beating Finland.
A hockey fan caught my error. I caught some time in the penalty box.
Ellsworth, of course, caught no miracle. She finished third in GOP voting.
Next came a caught-napping gaffe.
In a June piece on political polls, I wrote about a Franklin & Marshall College poll showing incumbent Gov. Tom Wolf leading Scott Wagner by 19 points, and a Wagner poll showing Wolf leading by 7 points.
The column examined methodologies and arguments supporting each poll, and noted that Nate Silver’s analytical website FiveThirtyEight grades pollsters over time. It gave F&M a B- and Wagner’s pollster, McLaughlin & Associates, a C-.
(Wolf beat Wagner by 17 points.)
But in mentioning Silver, I wrote FiveThirtyEight was a New York Times gig. And it was once. But it then became an ESPN thing. And now it’s an ABC News thing. (Both networks are owned by Disney.)
In other words, I slept through two changes. Talk about needing a wakeup call as a reminder to double-check stuff one thinks one knows.
Then, in July, blooper-mania. Two mistakes in one month.
In a column on the changing Supreme Court, abortion and the governor’s race, I used a familiar phrase inaccurately.
I noted abortion seems headed back to the states. That Wagner, as state senator, cosponsored legislation outlawing abortion a month earlier than current law. That Wolf vetoed that legislation. And since it’s likely the next governor signs or vetoes anti-abortion bills, I suggested that “begs the question” of how the issue impacts the governor’s race.
I was rightly upbraided by a reader who pointed out that “begs the question” is a phrase from logic assuming a premise to be true, and that what I should have written was “raises the question.”
The reader’s right. I was wrong. I’ve banned the phrase from future columns.
The other midsummer mistake was in a column looking at Sen. Bob Casey’s accomplishments. (Yes, there are some.)
In referring to legislation he got enacted to increase transparency in investigations of sexual assault on college campuses, I wrote that all notices of disciplinary action must go to both “victims and accusers.”
Redundant. And presumptive. Should have written alleged victims and those accused of assault.
I don’t know. Summer slump? Heat stroke?
Anyway, a new year’s coming. Another chance to shoot for factual flawlessness.
Meanwhile, cheers to all for a happy 2019.

Ryuk suspected in papers' attack; The malware that hit L.A. Times is similar to one linked to the North Korean group behind WannaCry.

Texto completo: Malware comes in many forms.
Bad links can lead to obnoxious adware that unleashes a plague of pop-ups. Nefarious attachments can hijack your processor for a bitcoin-mining botnet.
Ryuk, a malware program believed to have been used in an attack this weekend that hobbled newspapers nationwide, including the Los Angeles Times, is a sophisticated twist on an extortionate classic.

Once Ryuk gets into a network, it automatically spreads from computer to computer, node to node, encrypting important files along the way with an unbreakable code. Try to access the encrypted data, and the malware presents a ransom note: deposit bitcoin into an anonymous wallet and receive a key to decrypt your entire system. Refuse to pay, and the files remain locked for good.
This piece of ransomware managed to throw a monkey wrench into Tribune Publishing newspaper operations, which under-gird its printing plants as well as those of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune. The Times and Union-Tribune are no longer owned by Tribune Publishing -- they were purchased by Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong in June -- but still share many systems.
The problem surfaced near midnight Thursday, when sports editors at the Union-Tribune struggled to transmit finished pages to the printing facility. It spread rapidly over the following day, impeding distribution of the Saturday editions of The Times and Union-Tribune, as well as papers in Florida, Chicago and Connecticut and the West Coast editions of the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, which are printed in downtown Los Angeles.
By Monday, problems in production and delivery were largely resolved, said Marisa Kollias, spokeswoman for Tribune Publishing.
A screen shot of affected company files obtained by The Times shows a ransom note titled RyukReadMe that is similar to messages reported in other Ryuk incidents. No ransom amount was specified. The company would not confirm that it had been affected by Ryuk in particular or a ransomware attack in general.
Such attacks are increasingly common. In 2016, devices and medical records at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center were locked down until the hospital paid a $17,000 ransom in bitcoin. In May 2017, the WannaCry ransomware spread to an estimated 200,000 computers in 150 countries, triggering a crisis in the United Kingdom when it hit the National Health Service. Similar threats targeted the Port of Long Beach in July and the Port of San Diego in September.
Ryuk itself appeared on the radar of cybersecurity experts in August, when the security researchers MalwareHunterTeam reported five initial victims. An analysis by Check Point Research published later that month estimated that it had already netted the attackers more than $640,000, and that much of its code matched that of a known ransomware program called Hermes, which has been linked to the North Korean hacking group that many believe was behind the WannaCry attack.
Determining the origin of an attack is exceedingly difficult, as is establishing any links to state actors.
"Really the only way is, once you go in and raid someone and knock down their door and seize their computers, you find the code on their computers," said Clifford Neuman, director of USC's Center for Computer System Security. "That's the only way to absolutely attribute."
The name Ryuk appears to be a reference to a character in the popular anime and manga series "Death Note." In the comics, Ryuk is a demon of death who, bored with his immortality, decides to introduce into the world a notebook that allows its finder to kill anyone by writing their name.
Most ransomware attacks come from programs that target a vast number of individuals with infected links or attachments, and then ask for a small amount of money to unlock the computers, said Ben Herzog, a security researcher with Check Point.
Ryuk, he said, is different.
"Commodity ransomware like GandCrab has a large affiliate program, many possible infection vectors, and a constant drip of victims and ransom payments," Herzog wrote in an email. "Ryuk, in contrast, is a relatively 'artisanal' malware," which is used to target specific companies with little tolerance for disruption such as hospitals, ports, and, now, apparently newspapers.
Since emerging as a mass phenomenon over the last few years, ransomware and those who deploy it have been locked in an arms race with security systems and researchers. Both have grown more sophisticated as a result.
Newer models can exploit known security weaknesses to jump from user to user, accessing more secure files along the way.
The Check Point security analysis did not find that Ryuk had a method for automatically spreading among a network, which Itay Cohen, another security researcher with Check Point, said might indicate "prior, manual work that was done by the attackers in order to take these networks as a hostage."

Texto completo: In the late 1930s and early 1940s, New York City sent photographers to every building in every borough in an attempt to make property tax assessments fairer and more accurate. The result was more than 700,000 black-and-white snapshots of everything from fashionable apartment buildings in Manhattan to this out-of-the-way diner on Staten Island. The city recently had the images digitized.
The photos didn't win any prizes. They were "neither artistically nor technologically accomplished," according to Gabrielle Esperdy, an architectural historian.
But city officials did not want art, they wanted documentation to back up the terse written descriptions of each building in the files. For accuracy, each photograph showed not only a building, but also its block and lot number as registered in municipal records.
The photographers carried sign boards with letters and numbers that they changed between shots.
Sometimes, someone held up the sign board and did not get out of the way before the shutter clicked. Hands, arms and even faces appear in some photographs.
Not every picture that was taken went into the city's tax files. Officials rejected photographs when the wrong things dominated.
Eighty years later, the tax photos present a portrait of a city that was climbing giddily toward a new and taller future, with skyscrapers like the Empire State Building.
But it also documented daily life in areas that were holding onto the past. Newfangled traffic lights had become common, but in some neighborhoods, horse-drawn carriages still made the rounds.
With digitized originals in hand, we went back to some of the places in the photographs to see how the city has changed -- and how it hasn't. New York was still feeling the pain of the Depression when the tax photographers went to work, but not all construction stopped. The no-vacancy sign was soon up at this modern apartment complex at 240 Central Park South. Today, amid a new round of construction, buildings like the 66-story condominium at 220 Central Park South are overshadowing No. 240, which, at 28 stories, no longer seems so tall.
The current owner of this house on Staten Island said it was probably built by German immigrants in the 1830s. It sat close to the main road to New Jersey when the trip involved paying a ferry fare, not a bridge toll. Today, the house looks almost the same, except for the door, which was shifted to the right in the 1990s to make space for a bathroom. The owner, John Sullivan, and his wife used to live in Manhattan. "It was the first house we ever looked at," he said. "It was abysmal, but it had a large garden, and my wife was into gardening."
In the 1930s, the neighborhood around Broadway and Columbus Avenue in Manhattan was more raffish than respectable. "Stain Specialists," read the sign outside a dry cleaner there. "Expert Removal of Blood, Ink, Nail Polish, Vomit." Under a slum clearance plan, the city leveled 18 blocks to build Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. The New York Philharmonic moved into what is now David Geffen Hall in 1962.
In the 1930s, the Peoples Hardware store was a fixture on Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan, selling everything from lawn mowers -- as if there were any lawns nearby -- to fishing tackles while the Ninth Avenue El clattered by on elevated tracks. That block of Greenwich Street disappeared from the map in the 1960s, when construction began on the original World Trade Center. After the attack on Sept. 11, 2001, the block became part of the site of the soaring Oculus, the centerpiece of a $4 billion transit center and shopping mall.
In 1926, before Max Feinberg bought this building and turned it into a children's clothing store, the building at 86 Orchard Street in the Lower East Side of Manhattan was a restaurant -- and the scene of a gangland shooting. The gunmen sneaked in while the owner was distracted by a telephone call from someone involved with the gangsters who wanted him dead. Max Feinberg lives on, but in name only. A hosiery retailer arrived in the 1940s, and in 2010, the building again became a restaurant.
In the heart of Little Italy in the Bronx, two butchers posed when the tax photographer stopped by. Next door, at 2342 Arthur Avenue, was a restaurant that had opened about 20 years earlier, when the neighborhood was drawing immigrant laborers from Italy. The restaurant, Mario's, now fills two storefronts. When the director Francis Ford Coppola asked about filming a murder scene there for "The Godfather," the original Mario, Mario Migliucci, said no. "My father didn't want that stigma in here," said his son Joseph.
In 1930, a small building on East 59th Street by the Queensboro Bridge was remodeled for the Gnome Bakery. By the time the tax photograph was taken, a retail bake shop in front had been turned into a loading dock for Gnome's trucks. Today, Gnome is gone, and the building is dwarfed by postwar apartment houses. Gnome was swallowed up by a larger baking company. After housing a picture-frame maker, an exterminator and a kitchen-supply store, the building became a chiropractor's office with a rental apartment upstairs that was listed for $14,000 a month in 2015.
The Plaza Hotel, which opened in 1907, was almost middle-aged when the tax photographer focused on the famous French Renaissance facade. Now, it's less of a hotel than it was when Eloise romped in the halls or Truman Capote presided over a celebrated masked ball in the 1960s. Over the years, the Plaza had a number of owners, including Donald J. Trump, and like several other New York hotels, it has fewer rooms for guests now: A top-to-bottom renovation in 2006 turned much of the building into luxury condominiums.
